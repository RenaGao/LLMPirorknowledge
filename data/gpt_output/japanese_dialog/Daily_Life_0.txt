peaker A (NS):** Good morning! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, good morning! I am fine, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thank you. I was curious, what does your morning routine look like?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, my morning... um, it is simple. I wake up... how to say... around six o'clock.

**Speaker A (NS):** Six o'clock, that’s quite early! What do you do after waking up?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, um... first, I drink water. It is... uh, for health, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good habit. Do you have breakfast after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, breakfast. I eat rice and miso soup. Sometimes egg, too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds delicious! Do you make it yourself?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I make. It is easy. But sometimes my mother help... helps me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice. After breakfast, do you have any other morning rituals?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes. I do some exercise. Like... um, stretching and little jogging.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exercise in the morning is a great way to start the day. Do you listen to music when you jog?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I listen to music. It makes me feel... uh, better.

**Speaker A (NS):** What kind of music do you enjoy?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I like J-Pop. And sometimes... um, how to say... classical music?

**Speaker A (NS):** Classical music, that’s wonderful. How about getting ready for work or school?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, after exercise, I take shower and get dressed. Then, I go to work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you usually take the train to work?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, train. It is... um, many people, busy. But I bring book to read.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a smart way to use your time. What kind of books do you like to read?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like... um, how you say, mystery books. Detective story.

**Speaker A (NS):** Mystery books are exciting! It sounds like you have a productive morning routine.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I try to start good day. And your morning, how is it?

**Speaker A (NS):** My morning is quite similar, but I usually skip jogging. Maybe I should start!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, jogging is good. You can try small first. Thank you for talk!

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, thank you for sharing your routine with me! Have a great day ahe
