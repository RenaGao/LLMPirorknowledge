peaker A (NS):** Hi Yuki, it’s been a while! How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello! I am good, thank you. But recently, I feel a little tired. Um, how to say... not enough energy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Maybe you need to focus on your health. Are you getting enough sleep?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sleep... not so much. I sleep maybe, um, five hour every night.

**Speaker A (NS):** Five hours is quite short. Adults usually need at least seven to eight hours of sleep.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I understand. I try to sleep more. But, um, sometimes I have many work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, work can be demanding. How about your diet? Are you eating well?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Diet... I eat, um, many fast food. Not much vegetable.

**Speaker A (NS):** Eating vegetables is important. They give you vitamins and nutrients.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I need to eat more, um, healthy food. What else is good for health?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exercise is great too! Do you do any physical activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I walk sometimes. But no regular, how to say... routine?

**Speaker A (NS):** A routine is helpful. Even just 30 minutes of walking daily is beneficial.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see. I will try to walk more. Maybe in morning time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Morning walks are refreshing. Also, drinking enough water helps.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Water? I drink, um, how you say... soda mostly.

**Speaker A (NS):** Soda can be enjoyable, but water is much better for staying hydrated.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I will try. Um, any other advice you have?

**Speaker A (NS):** Meditation can help with stress. It’s relaxing and improves focus.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Meditation? I have not tried. Is it difficult?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not at all! It just requires a quiet spot and some practice. I can show you sometime.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I want to learn. Staying healthy is important.

**Speaker A (NS):** It is. Taking small steps can make a big difference. Let me know if you need any help.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I will. Thank you for your advice. I feel ready to sta
