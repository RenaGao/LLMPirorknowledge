peaker A (NS):** Hi Yuki, do you have a moment to talk about the project deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, of course. Um, the deadline is, uh, next week, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's correct. I wanted to see if you're comfortable with the timeline or if there's anything you need.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, I think, um, maybe it's a bit... how to say... tight? Yes, tight.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Are there specific parts of the project that are causing concern?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, the... um, research part. It takes much time... uh, more than I thought.

**Speaker A (NS):** The research part is challenging. Would it help if we prioritized certain sections?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that help. Maybe focus on important first... like... uh, main findings?

**Speaker A (NS):** We can schedule a separate review for the presentation. How about later this week?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, later this week is good. Uh, can we do, um, Thursday?

**Speaker A (NS):** Thursday works for me. Let's aim for the afternoon, say around 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, 2 p.m. is fine. Um, I will be ready by then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, and I'll also be available if you have questions before then.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. Uh, I think I will need some help with, um, data analysis.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! We can go over the data analysis part together. Are there any specific tools you're using?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I use Excel mainly. But, uh, still learning some function.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excel is powerful for data analysis. I can show you some advanced functions if you'd like.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That would be very helpful. Thank you for your support.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Yuki. Let's make sure everything is on track, and don't hesitate to reach out.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Um, thank you again, and see you on Thursday.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then, Yuki. Have a great d
