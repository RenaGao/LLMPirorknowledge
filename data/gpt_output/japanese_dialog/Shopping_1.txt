peaker A (NS):** Hi there! It’s a nice day for shopping at the market, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, very nice day. I like the market here. Many thing to buy.

**Speaker A (NS):** What are you planning to buy today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, today I want to buy... how to say... a bag? Yes, a bag for work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, a work bag. Do you have a specific type in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I look for, um... leather bag. It is good quality. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Leather bags are nice! Do you have a budget?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to spend not too much. Maybe around, uh, 50 dollars?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds reasonable. Have you seen any you like yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Over there, that shop. But, it is... um... a little expensive, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Would you like me to help you negotiate the price?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, please! I am not so good at... um, bargain?

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let’s see if we can get a better deal. What price did they ask for?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** They say, uh, 70 dollars. But I want lower if can.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let’s start by asking if they can offer a discount for cash payment.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, good idea! I think they like cash more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! We’re interested in this leather bag. Is there any discount if we pay in cash?

**Vendor (imaginary):** Well, if you pay cash, I can give it to you for 65 dollars.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, can we ask, maybe... 60 dollars? It is close to my budget.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good suggestion! Let’s try. How about 60 dollars? My friend has a tight budget.

**Vendor (imaginary):** Hmm, alright. For you, I can do 60 dollars.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, thank you! I am happy with this price.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great job! You got a good deal.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you for help. I learn much from you today.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your new bag!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Thank you so mu
