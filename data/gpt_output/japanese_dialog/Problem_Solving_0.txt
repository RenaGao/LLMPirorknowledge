peaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! I wanted to talk about our plan for Friday evening. Are we still set to meet at the usual spot at 7 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, hello! Yes, about Friday... I think we say 8 p.m., not 7 p.m.?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I remember 7 p.m. Was there a change?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, maybe I mistake. I think I heard 8 p.m. from last time. Sorry.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all! Let’s double-check to make sure. Do you prefer 7 or 8?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, 7 is okay. I just worry about train... I mean, if I can arrive on time.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Is there a later train that makes it difficult?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, train is busy in evening. Sometimes delay... um, like late.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Would you feel more comfortable meeting at 8 then?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, maybe better at 8. But I try to come fast for 7 if possible.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s aim for 7, but don't worry if you're a bit late. I can wait.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I try my best. Also, um, about place. We meet at cafe, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the café by the station. Is that still good for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is good. I like their coffee. Very warm and relax.

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree, their coffee is excellent. Do you have a favorite drink there?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I like... how to say... the one with milk and little sugar?

**Speaker A (NS):** A latte, perhaps?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, latte! I always forget name. Very tasty.

**Speaker A (NS):** Lattes are great, I usually get one too. We can enjoy them together!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, very nice. I look forward to see you on Friday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here, Yuki! Let me know if anything changes.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I will tell you. Thank you for understanding!

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, anytime. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Bye-bye! See you so
