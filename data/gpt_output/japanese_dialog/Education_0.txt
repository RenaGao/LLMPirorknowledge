peaker A (NS):** Hi Haruto, are you ready for the exam tomorrow?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! Um, exam is... difficult for me. I study many hours, but still worry.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. What part do you find most challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, um... the writing part. I, uh, hard to make sentences correct.

**Speaker A (NS):** Writing can be tricky. Have you practiced writing with someone?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, a little. I write with friend and check mistake, but, um... still not confident.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good start. Maybe try writing small paragraphs and check them one by one? 

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Small paragraph is easier. I will, um, try this today.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Break is... very important. I will not forget. Thank you.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Reading is okay, but some words are, um... new for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** You could make a list of new words and learn their meanings. Maybe that would help.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, list is good idea. I write new word and... study meaning.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a solid plan. Do you have any other concerns?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... I think that is all. Just need to calm... calm down and focus.

**Speaker A (NS):** For sure, stay calm and do your best. I know you’ll do great!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I feel better now. I will try my best tomorrow.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Haruto. Best of luck, and let me know how it goes!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will! Thank you again for your help. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, and take ca
