peaker A (NS):** Hi, welcome to the team! I'm Aiman. How are you settling in so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello, Aiman. I am, um, good. Still learning the... how to say, the ropes? The ropes, yes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great to hear! Today, I want to explain how we organize our project files. Do you have any experience with file management systems?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, file management. Yes, I use before. But maybe different... system here.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, I'll walk you through it. We use a shared drive for all project documents. Have you accessed it yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I think no. I need to, um, get permission maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right. I can help set that up for you. Once you have access, you'll see folders for each project phase. Any questions so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, got it. But, uh, the naming... the way we name the files, is there a rule?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! We follow a specific format: project name, date, and document type. This helps everyone find things easily. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think I understand. So, like, um, "Project ABC_2023-11-01_Report"?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You've got it. We also use color codes for urgent files. Red is for high priority. Does that sound okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, red is urgent. What about, um, other colors?

**Speaker A (NS):** Blue is for drafts, and green is for completed. It's a simple system but effective. Do you think you can work with that?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I can follow. Uh, one more thing, if can ask? How to, um, update when file change?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great question! You should update the file version and notify the team via email or our messaging app. Do you use that app yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I just install yesterday. Still, uh, figuring out.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, take your time. It's pretty user-friendly. Just let me know if you need any help with it.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, Aiman. This is very helpful. I'm learning step by step.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're doing well! Don't hesitate to ask if you have more questions.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I will. Thanks again for your support. I feel more confident now.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Let's have a great project together.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, let's do that. Looking forward to
