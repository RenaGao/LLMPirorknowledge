peaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m great, thanks. I was thinking about when we talked about dining customs. I’m curious, how is it different in Malaysia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, in Malaysia, we have, um, different way. We like to use hand for eating, especially rice. It is, uh, more traditional.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting! Do you use any utensils at all?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes. We also use spoon and fork. But, um, for some food, like nasi lemak, eating with hand feel better.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Is there a specific way to eat with your hands?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes. We use right hand only. It is, uh, polite. And we must wash hands before eating.

**Speaker A (NS):** Makes sense! What about when you’re dining out? Do people usually share food?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, often we share. It is, uh, like family style. We put dishes in middle and everyone, um, take what they want.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great way to enjoy a meal together. Are there any customs about finishing your food?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, yes, it is good to finish your, uh, plate. It show you like the food. But not too much, so you have space for dessert!

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, dessert is important! How about tipping? Is it common there?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Tipping is not very, um, usual. But if service is good, people sometimes give small tip.

**Speaker A (NS):** Interesting. So, what’s a must-try dish when visiting Malaysia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, must try nasi lemak! It is our, um, national dish. Very delicious with, uh, sambal and peanuts.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve heard about it! Is it spicy?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, can be spicy, but some people make not too hot. You can say, um, “less spicy” if you don’t like too hot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. How about drinks? What’s popular?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, we have teh tarik. It is, uh, pulled tea. Very nice, sweet, and creamy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds tasty! I’d love to try that. Thank you for sharing, Farah.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You’re welcome! I hope you can try them soon. Let me know when you visit!

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely, I will! Thanks again for the insig
