**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, it's good here. Weather is very hot these days. How is KL?

**Speaker A (NS):** It's quite humid, but not too bad. Have you been up to anything interesting lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Uh, not much. Just busy with work and... how to say... family things.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Family keeps us busy! Are you still working at the same company?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, still there. I am... um, I manage project now. It is... sometimes stress.
