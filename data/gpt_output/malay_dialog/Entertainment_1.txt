**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, do you mean the one near the Central Mall?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes, that the one! I think it called... um, Red Chili or something like that.

**Speaker A (NS):** Red Chili, got it. What time shall we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe, um, seven o'clock? Is that okay for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Seven works perfectly! Should we do something after dinner?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, maybe... uh, we can go see movie? Or walk in park?
