peaker A (NS):** Hi Zainal, do you have a moment to discuss the project deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, um, I can talk now. The project, it is, uh, almost done, but some thing, uh, not finished.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Can you tell me which parts are still pending?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Uh, the report is... um, how to say... not completed. Only section three and four need more work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, sections three and four. Do you need any help with them?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe for section three, the data... a bit confusing. I need, uh, verify some numbers.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with verifying the numbers. Have you set a new timeline for these sections?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think, uh, maybe end of this week. Um, is it okay with you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that sounds reasonable. Do you think you have enough resources to meet that deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Uh, yes, I think I have enough. But if, um, something not enough, I will ask you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, please do. How about section four, is there anything specific you’re struggling with?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Uh, section four is, um, about client feedback. I... how to say... organize it better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Organizing the feedback, right? Perhaps a spreadsheet might help?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes, a spreadsheet! I will try that. Thank you for, um, idea.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Once you’ve organized it, let me know if you need further assistance.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will let you know. Thank you for, uh, your support.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, Zainal. We’re a team. Do you have any other concerns regarding the project?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Uh, no, I think others are okay now. Just need, um, more focus.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, if you stay focused, I’m sure you’ll meet the deadline. Keep me updated, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will update you. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Let’s make sure everything is on track. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, you t
