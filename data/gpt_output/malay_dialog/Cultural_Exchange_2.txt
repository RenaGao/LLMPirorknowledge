peaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! I was curious, what's your favorite holiday in Malaysia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, um, my favorite is Hari Raya. You know it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I've heard of it! It's to celebrate the end of Ramadan, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes! After fasting, we celebrate. We wear new clothes, and visit family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. What do you usually do on that day?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We, um, start with prayer at mosque. Then, eat special food like ketupat and rendang.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I've tried rendang before! It's delicious. Do you make it yourself?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sometimes, yes. But mostly, my mother make it. Her rendang very good!

**Speaker A (NS):** I bet it is! Is there anything else you do during Hari Raya?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we also give, um, money gift to children. We call it ‘duit raya.’

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a nice tradition. I imagine the kids love it!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, they very happy to receive. Also, we visit grave of family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a meaningful way to remember them. How long does the celebration last?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Usually one month, but first few days are most busy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, a whole month! Do you have any favorite memories from past Hari Raya?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, um, one year, all my cousins come. We play games and eat a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a lot of fun! Do you exchange gifts like in some other holidays?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not so much for adults. Mostly give ‘duit raya’ or maybe cookies.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What kind of cookies do you have?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, we have, um, pineapple tarts and kuih raya, many types.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those sound delicious. Thanks for sharing, Farah! I learned a lot.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You’re welcome! I happy to tell you about
