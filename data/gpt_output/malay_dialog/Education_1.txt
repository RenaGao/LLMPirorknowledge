peaker A (NS):** Hi, Amira! Thanks for coming. What topic are you finding challenging in our study group?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! Um, the topic is, uh, "genetic engineering." It is... very hard for me to understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Genetic engineering can be complex. Which part is the most confusing for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Uh, yes, the part about, um, how to say... changing the DNA, I think?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean gene editing? It’s about modifying the genetic material of an organism.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that one! Gene editing. How do they change the DNA?

**Speaker A (NS):** They use a tool called CRISPR. It’s like a pair of scissors for DNA to cut and add genes.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, CRISPR. I hear about this. But, uh, why they do this? Why change DNA?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! It’s used for many reasons, like curing genetic diseases or improving crops.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I see. So, it can help sick people, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. It can potentially cure diseases by correcting faulty genes.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** But, uh, is it safe? I mean, can something go wrong?

**Speaker A (NS):** There are risks, of course. That’s why scientists test it carefully before using it widely.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I understand now. It need to be very careful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, safety is important. Do you have any other questions about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, how about... ethical? Is it okay to change genes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a big topic. Some people worry about the ethical implications and long-term effects.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I see. It is more than just science, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly. It involves ethical, social, and even political considerations.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. This help me a lot. I feel... less confused now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that! Feel free to ask if you have more questions.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I will. Thank you so much for your he
