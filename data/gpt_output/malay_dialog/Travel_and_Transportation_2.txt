peaker A (NS):** Hi, Nadia! I was thinking, how about we plan a group vacation soon?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, that sound fun! Um, where you think we should go?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking maybe we could go to Langkawi. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Langkawi is nice! I hear they have nice beach... beaches, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the beaches are beautiful there. And there are lots of activities too.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Activities? Like, um... what we can do there?

**Speaker A (NS):** We can go island hopping, visit the cable car, and maybe snorkeling.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I like snorkeling! But, um, is it expensive?

**Speaker A (NS):** It can be, but we can look for good deals online. How many people do you think will join?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe... um, five or six. I can ask our friends.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Let me see... How about, um... next month? During school holiday maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect. It might be a bit crowded, but that’s okay. Do you think everyone will agree?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think so. Everyone like holiday. I will, um... message them today.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! And what about the accommodation? Hotel or maybe a chalet?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think chalet can be good. More, um... how to say, private?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, a chalet would be nice and cozy. Let’s check online for options.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, I will help look. Um, do we need to rent a car there?

**Speaker A (NS):** Renting a car could be useful, especially for getting around easily.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will check car rental too. Anything else we need plan?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think we’ve covered most things. Just confirm with everyone first.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will do that. Thank you for help, Sarah!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Nadia! Let’s make this a great tr
