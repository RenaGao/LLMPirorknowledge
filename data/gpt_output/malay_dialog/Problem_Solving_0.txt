peaker A (NS):** Hi, Hana! I heard you were upset with me. Can we talk about what happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, yes, Aisha. I... how to say... I was little upset about yesterday.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sorry to hear that. Was it something I said or did?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, uh... when you say you not want to come... um, to my party. I feel, uh, like you not care.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, Hana! I didn't mean it that way. I just had a family commitment I couldn't avoid.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I see now. I thought, um, maybe you angry or... not like my party.

**Speaker A (NS):** Not at all! I really wanted to be there. Can we make it up somehow?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, uh, maybe we can meet for lunch this week?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect! How about Thursday? Are you free then?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Let me check... Um, yes, Thursday is good. What time?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 1 p.m.? We can try that new caf√© you mentioned.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! I want to go there. They have good cake, I hear.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'm looking forward to it. Is there anything else on your mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, no. Just happy we talk about this. I feel better now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad, Hana. Communication is important, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, important. I will try more next time to talk, if I feel... um, not sure.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good plan. I'm always here to listen.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, Aisha. You are a good friend.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Hana. You're a great friend too. See you on Thursday!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, see you Thursd
