peaker A (NS):** Hey, are you ready for the exam next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, not really ready. I still have many topics to, uh, revise. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m getting there. Which topics do you find challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, the history part is hard. Too many dates and events to remember.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, history can be tricky. Do you make summaries or notes?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I write notes, but sometimes it’s too much. I don’t know how to, uh, choose important part.

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe focus on key events and their impacts? That helps me.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Good idea. I will try that. And how about the math section?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think the math is okay if you practice problems. Have you tried any past papers?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I do some, but not many. I find some question very confusing.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s important to understand the concepts. Can I help with any specific problem?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, thank you. Yes, the algebra question with, uh, equation. Very hard to solve.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, we can go through it together. It’s usually about finding the right formula.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I see. I often forget formula, maybe need practice more.

**Speaker A (NS):** We can practice together. It’s always easier with a study buddy.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that would be nice. When can we study?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about tomorrow afternoon? We can meet at the library.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, library is good. Um, what time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s say 3 p.m.? Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, 3 p.m. is perfect. Thank you for helping!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! We’ll tackle this exam together. See you tomorr
