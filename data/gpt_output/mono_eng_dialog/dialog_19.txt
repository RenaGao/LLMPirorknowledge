**Speaker A:** Good afternoon, Alex. Thanks for joining me today for this interview. How are you doing?

**Speaker B:** Hi, thanks for having me. I'm doing well, a bit nervous, to be honest. How about you?

**Speaker A:** I'm doing great, thank you. It's perfectly normal to feel a bit nervous. Let's just have a friendly chat. Could you start by telling me a little about yourself and why you're interested in this position?

**Speaker B:** Sure! I recently graduated with a degree in Environmental Science, and I've always been passionate about sustainability. This role seems like a perfect fit because it aligns with my interests and career goals.

**Speaker A:** That sounds wonderful. Can you tell me about a project or experience that helped you develop your skills in this area?

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. During my final year, I led a team project focused on reducing waste on campus. We implemented a recycling program that increased the recycling rate by 30%. It taught me a lot about teamwork and project management.

**Speaker A:** Impressive! It's clear you have hands-on experience. How do you handle challenges when working in a team environment?

**Speaker B:** I believe open communication is key. I always encourage team members to share their ideas and concerns. If a challenge arises, I like to gather everyone's input and find a solution collaboratively.

**Speaker A:** That's a great approach. We value teamwork highly here. Lastly, where do you see yourself in five years, and how do you think this role will help you get there?

**Speaker B:** In five years, I hope to have advanced to a leadership role, where I can influence larger sustainability initiatives. This position seems like a great stepping stone to gain the necessary experience and understanding of industry practices.

**Speaker A:** Thank you for sharing that, Alex. It's been a pleasure talking with you. We'll be in touch soon regarding the next steps.

**Speaker B:** Thank you for the opportunity. I appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you.
