**Speaker A:** Good morning, Sarah. Thanks for reaching out. How can I assist you today?  

**Speaker B:** Hi, John. I wanted to ask a few questions about the university admission process. I'm a bit confused about the deadlines and requirements.  

**Speaker A:** Of course, I'd be happy to help. Could you tell me which program you're interested in?  

**Speaker B:** Sure, I'm looking at the Master's in Environmental Science. I've heard it's quite competitive.  

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's a popular choice. The deadline for applications is December 1st. Have you started gathering your documents yet?  

**Speaker B:** I have most of them ready, but I'm unsure about the recommendation letters. How many do I need?  

**Speaker A:** For that program, you'll need three recommendation letters. It's good to choose people who can speak to your strengths in the field.  

**Speaker B:** Great, Iâ€™ll make sure to get those. Is there an interview as part of the application process?  

**Speaker A:** Yes, there is a panel interview. If your application is shortlisted, you'll be invited for that in January.  

**Speaker B:** That sounds fair. Any tips on how to prepare for the interview?  

**Speaker A:** Definitely. It's important to be familiar with current issues in environmental science and have a clear idea of your research interests.  

**Speaker B:** Thanks, John. This has been really helpful. I feel more prepared now.  

**Speaker A:** No problem at all, Sarah. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out. Good luck with your application!  

**Speaker B:** I will, thank you! Have a great day!
