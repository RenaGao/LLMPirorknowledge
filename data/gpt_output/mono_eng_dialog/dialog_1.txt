**Speaker A:** Good morning! Thank you for joining us today. How are you feeling?  

**Speaker B:** Morning! I’m doing well, thanks. A bit nervous, but excited too.  

**Speaker A:** That’s perfectly normal. Let’s get started, shall we? Could you tell me a little about your background and why you’re interested in this position?  

**Speaker B:** Sure! I recently graduated with a degree in marketing, and I’ve always been passionate about digital media. Your company stood out to me because of its innovative approach to social media campaigns.  

**Speaker A:** That’s great to hear. We do pride ourselves on creativity. Can you describe a project from your studies or previous work that you’re particularly proud of?  

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. I worked on a campaign for a local non-profit that aimed to increase volunteer sign-ups. We used targeted ads and storytelling, and it ended up boosting their numbers by 30%.  

**Speaker A:** Impressive! What did you find most challenging about that project, and how did you overcome it?  

**Speaker B:** The biggest challenge was limited resources. I focused on maximizing our impact by leveraging partnerships with local businesses, which helped stretch our budget further.  

**Speaker A:** Excellent problem-solving. Now, how do you handle feedback, especially when it’s critical?  

**Speaker B:** I always try to view feedback as a learning opportunity. I take notes, ask clarifying questions if needed, and apply the insights to future projects.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a great attitude. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me about the role or the company?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I’m curious about the team dynamics here. Could you share a bit about how your team collaborates on projects?  

**Speaker A:** Of course. We have a very collaborative environment where everyone’s input is valued. We hold regular brainstorming sessions and encourage open communication.  

**Speaker B:** That sounds fantastic. Thank you for the insights and the opportunity to discuss this role.  

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome. It was a pleasure speaking with you. We’ll be in touch soon with next steps.
