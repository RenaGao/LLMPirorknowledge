**Speaker A:** Good morning! I'm here to assist you with any questions you might have about your application. How can I help you today?  

**Speaker B:** Good morning! Yes, I was wondering about the timeline for hearing back after submitting my application.  

**Speaker A:** Great question! Typically, you'll receive a response within two to three weeks. Is there a specific program or position you're applying for?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's for the marketing internship. I've submitted everything but wanted to make sure I didn't miss any steps.  

**Speaker A:** You're on the right track! Have you also completed the optional essay? It's not mandatory but can strengthen your application.  

**Speaker B:** Oh, I didn't realize that. I thought it was just for additional context. Do you recommend submitting it?  

**Speaker A:** If you feel it would highlight your skills and experiences further, it could definitely be beneficial. Do you need any guidance on what to include?  

**Speaker B:** That would be helpful, thanks. I'm not sure if I should focus on my academic achievements or previous work experiences.  

**Speaker A:** A balance of both could work well. Maybe start with a significant academic achievement and then relate it to a practical experience. This shows how you apply knowledge in real-world settings.  

**Speaker B:** That makes sense. I'll start drafting it this evening. Is there a deadline for the optional essay?  

**Speaker A:** Ideally, submit it within a week to keep your application timely. Let me know if you need any feedback on your draft.  

**Speaker B:** I appreciate that! I'll definitely take you up on the offer. Thank you for all your help today.  

**Speaker A:** You're welcome! Good luck with your application, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions. Have a great day!
