**Speaker A:** Hello, thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. How can I assist you?  
**Speaker B:** Hi! I’m considering applying to your university and wanted to know more about the application process. Could you give me some guidance?  
**Speaker A:** Of course! Are you applying as an undergraduate or a graduate student?  
**Speaker B:** I’m looking at undergraduate programs. Specifically, I’m interested in psychology.  
**Speaker A:** Great choice! For undergraduates, you’ll need to complete our online application, submit transcripts, and provide a personal statement. Have you started on any of these yet?  
**Speaker B:** I’ve begun drafting my personal statement. Do you have any tips on what to include?  
**Speaker A:** Definitely. Focus on what drives your interest in psychology and any relevant experiences. It’s important to convey your passion and potential contributions to the university community.  
**Speaker B:** That makes sense. I’ve volunteered at a mental health clinic, so I’ll include that. Is there a specific format I should follow?  
**Speaker A:** We don’t have a strict format, but clear and concise writing works best. Just ensure it’s well-organized and free of errors. Do you have someone who can review it for you?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, I have a teacher who agreed to look it over. What about deadlines?  
**Speaker A:** For the upcoming fall semester, the deadline is January 15th. I recommend submitting everything a little early to avoid any last-minute issues.  
**Speaker B:** Got it. I’ll aim for that. Is there anything else I should be aware of?  
**Speaker A:** Just make sure to check your email regularly for any updates or additional requirements. And feel free to reach out if you have more questions.  
**Speaker B:** Thank you so much for your help! I feel more prepared now.  
**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Best of luck with your application. We hope to see you on campus soon!
