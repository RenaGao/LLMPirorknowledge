peaker A (NS):** Good morning! How was your morning today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Good morning! Ah, it was, um, okay. I wake up... I mean, I woke up late today.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, did you manage to have breakfast?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes. I have quick breakfast. Just tea and, uh, paratha. You know paratha? It's like bread but fried.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I love parathas! They're delicious. What do you usually do after breakfast?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** After breakfast, I... how to say... I take shower, then ready for work. 

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you commute to work or do you work from home?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I go to office. But today, um, traffic was very... how to say... jam?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, yes, a traffic jam. That must have been frustrating.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, very much. I was late to office. My boss, he say... um, not happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Sometimes it happens. Did you explain about the traffic?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I told him. He say okay. But I try to leave early next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good plan. Do you usually listen to music or something on your way to work?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I listen to music. Sometimes I listen, um, to learning English podcast.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! It must be helpful. What do you like about those podcasts?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** They are, um, easy to understand. And I learn new words, like today... "punctual."

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, thank you. I try hard to learn. And you? What is your morning routine?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I usually start my day with some yoga, then have breakfast, and get ready for work.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yoga, very nice. It's like... exercise, yes? Relaxing too?
