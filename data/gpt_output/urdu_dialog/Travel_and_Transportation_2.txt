peaker A (NS):** Hey Ali, I'm so excited about planning our group vacation! Have you thought about where we should go?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes, I'm thinking... maybe we go to the mountains? Like, uh, Murree or Naran?

**Speaker A (NS):** Those sound like great options! Murree is quite popular, but Naran could be more adventurous. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think Naran good. It's less, uh, crowded than Murree. But long drive, no?

**Speaker A (NS):** True, it's a bit of a drive, but we can enjoy the scenery on the way. What activities do you want to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, I like hiking. And, um, maybe we can do camping? Is that the right word?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, camping is right! Camping and hiking sound fun. Should we plan for any specific trails or spots?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I hear about, uh, Saif-ul-Malook lake. It is very beautiful, they say.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I've heard about it too! It's supposed to be stunning. We should definitely plan a visit there. How about food? Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, in Naran, I think we try local food. But also, we take some snacks and, um, what you call... packed food?

**Speaker A (NS):** Packed food, yes, that makes sense. Having some snacks for the hike will be handy. Do you think everyone in the group will agree?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think so. But, um, we can ask them. Maybe group chat is good for this?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea. Let's set up a group chat to discuss the details. Do you want to organize it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will do it. I will send message today evening. Oh, and, um, what about stay? Where we stay?

**Speaker A (NS):** We could either book a hotel or try finding a guesthouse. Both have their pros and cons. What do you prefer?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think guesthouse maybe better. It feel more, um, personal and also less money.

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed, guesthouses can be more economical and cozy. Do you know any good ones in the area?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Not really, but I can, um, search online and check reviews.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let me know what you find. Is there anything else we need to think about?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, yes, we should check about weather. It can be very, uh, unpredictable in mountains.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's important. We need to be prepared for rain or cold. Maybe we should pack some extra layers?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, extra layers and, um, maybe raincoat? Just in case.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Alright, let's finalize these plans with everyone. This is going to be such a memorable trip!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I am very excited! Thank you for help in planni
