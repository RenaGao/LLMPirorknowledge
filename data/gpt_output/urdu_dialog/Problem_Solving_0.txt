peaker A (NS):** Hi Maria, I heard that you were upset about something I said yesterday. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, hello. Um, I was little bit upset. It's about the party plan.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Did I misunderstand something about the plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, I think you say you not invite everyone? Is it correct?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I mentioned that the party is for close friends only. Did that cause confusion?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it was... um, mix-up. I think all friends are coming.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sorry if that wasn’t clear. It's a small gathering this time. I hope you understand.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I understand now. I just worry about others, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I get that. Do you think we should have a bigger event later?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, maybe later. Um, more people, more fun, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! It's nice to include everyone sometimes.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes. So, um, about the party now, what time is it?

**Speaker A (NS):** It starts at 7 PM. Are you free to come?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will come. What do I bring? Maybe food, uh... like dessert?

**Speaker A (NS):** A dessert would be perfect! Thank you, Maria.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No problem. I bring something sweet. Everyone like sweets, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Everyone loves sweets. I’m looking forward to it.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Me too. And thank you for understanding, um, the mix-up.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime. Communication is important, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, very important. We talk, we understand better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. See you at the party, Maria!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, see you so
