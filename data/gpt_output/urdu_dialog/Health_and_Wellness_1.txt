peaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal! How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello, Ayesha! I am good, thank you. Uh, just feeling little tired these days.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. Have you been taking care of your health?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, not really. I, uh, don't get much time for, um, exercise or good food.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s important to make some time for yourself. Are you drinking enough water?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Water? Ah, I think maybe not enough. I, uh, forget often.

**Speaker A (NS):** Try to keep a bottle with you, so you remember to drink more often.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, good idea. I can do this. What else for, um, staying healthy?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about your sleep? Are you getting enough rest?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sleep is not so good. I sleep late and wake up early. So, um... tired.

**Speaker A (NS):** That could be why you feel tired. Try setting a regular bedtime.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I should try. But sometimes, um, work is late.

**Speaker A (NS):** I get that. Maybe you can plan your work to finish earlier?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will try plan... planning better. And food? What should I eat more?

**Speaker A (NS):** Eat more fruits and vegetables. They’re full of nutrients.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Fruits and vegetables, yes. I like apple and, um, carrot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Those are great choices. Also, try to avoid too much junk food.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, junk food. It is, uh, hard to say no, but I will try.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good mindset. How about some light exercise, like walking?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Walking is good. I can walk to shop instead of, um, driving.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great start, Bilal! Little changes can make a big difference.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, Ayesha. I, uh, feel better talking with you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! I’m here if you need more advice.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thanks! I will let you know how it go
