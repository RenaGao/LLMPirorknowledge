peaker A (NS):** Hello! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes, please. I am looking for a hotel... nearby?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, there's a hotel just around the corner. Do you know the name?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I forget name. It is, um, not far... big and nice?

**Speaker A (NS):** Could it be the Grand Hotel? It's quite popular.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, Grand Hotel! How can I reach there?

**Speaker A (NS):** Just go straight on this road, and you'll see the hotel on your left.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, straight and then left. Is it, uh... how many minute walk?

**Speaker A (NS):** It's about a five-minute walk from here. Not too far at all.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. And, um, any good restaurant there?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the hotel has a nice restaurant. Do you want to try local food?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, local food good. I hear, um, spice is special?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! They have some great spicy dishes. Do you like spicy food?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, but not too much spice. Um, you know, balance?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. You can ask them to make it mild. They're quite accommodating.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. And, uh, anything else I should, um, see around?

**Speaker A (NS):** There's a lovely park nearby. It's a nice place for a walk if you have time.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Park sounds nice. Maybe after hotel. Thank you very much!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Enjoy your stay here. If you need more help, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will. Thank you again for kindness.

**Speaker A (NS):** My pleasure. Have a great day!
