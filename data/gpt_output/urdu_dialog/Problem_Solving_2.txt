peaker A (NS):** Hi Rehan, I wanted to talk to you about the presentation slides. I noticed there was a bit of a mix-up with the order. Did you see that too?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes, I see it now. Um, I am very sorry for this mistake. I think I, uh, put the wrong slides together.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's okay, these things happen. What do you think caused the mix-up?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I was, um, in a hurry because of... how to say... many tasks at the same time. Multitasking?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand, multitasking can be tricky. How do you plan to fix it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I will, uh, check slides again and put them in correct order. I can do it by today.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. Would you like any help or feedback while you’re working on it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I believe so. I will make sure to, uh, focus and not rush this time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great approach, Rehan. Remember, it's okay to take a break if you need one.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will keep that in mind. Thank you for your support.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. Is there anything else you want to address or clarify?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think this is all. I will let you know if I find something else.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright then. Don’t worry too much about the mistake; we all learn from them.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, you are right. I will make sure to, um, double-check next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good strategy. Looking forward to seeing the revised slides. Good luck!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you very much. I will do my be
