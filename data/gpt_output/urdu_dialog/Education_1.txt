peaker A (NS):** Hi Hina, I heard you needed some help with our history assignment. Let's see how I can assist.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, thank you. Um, I am finding it... difficult. The part about, uh, World War Two?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, it’s a big topic. Is there a specific area you’re struggling with?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, the... um, reasons why it start. I not understand fully.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's break it down. The causes were mainly political and economic tensions. Like, Germany was unhappy with the Treaty of Versailles. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, I heard about this treaty. It was, um, unfair to Germany, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. It imposed heavy penalties on Germany, which led to economic troubles and political instability.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** And, um, Hitler used this... how to say... situation to rise, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, he promised to restore Germany’s power, and many people supported him because of that.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, I see now. And other countries, they involved because of... alliances?

**Speaker A (NS):** Correct. Countries like Britain and France were allied, and when Germany invaded Poland, they declared war.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Poland, yes. This was first attack, na?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the invasion of Poland in 1939 marked the beginning of the war in Europe.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, this is more clear now. But, um, what about Japan? How they in war?

**Speaker A (NS):** Japan was expanding in Asia and had conflicts with China and the US. When they attacked Pearl Harbor, the US entered the war.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Pearl Harbor! I know this. It is in... um, Hawaii?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, in Hawaii. It was a surprise attack in 1941 that led the US to join the Allies.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Allies were... Britain, France, US, and others?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, and they fought against the Axis Powers, mainly Germany, Italy, and Japan.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thanks, now I understand better. But, um, one more thing. Why it take so long to end?

**Speaker A (NS):** There were many battles across different continents, and both sides had strong military strategies, which prolonged the war.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I see. Thank you for explaining. I feel ready to write now.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Hina. Let me know if you need any more he
