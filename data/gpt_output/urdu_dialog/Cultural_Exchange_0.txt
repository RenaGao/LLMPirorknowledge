peaker A (NS):** Hi, thanks for being here today! Can you tell me about a tradition or festival from Pakistan?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes, of course. We have many festivals, but one very important is Eid. You know Eid?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I’ve heard of Eid. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sure, um, Eid is after Ramadan. Ramadan is... uh, month of fasting. We, um, not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds very disciplined. What happens during Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** On Eid, we... how to say... celebrate? Yes, celebrate with family. We wear new clothes, and we eat... uh, many special foods.

**Speaker A (NS):** What kind of special foods do you usually have?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We have biryani, um, sweet dish called... um, seviyan. It is like noodles with milk and sugar.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds delicious! Do you have any special traditions during Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we give... um, money to children. It is called Eidi. Also, we visit, um, relatives and friends.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, one time we... um, all cousins meet at grandparents' house. It was very fun, playing and eating together.
