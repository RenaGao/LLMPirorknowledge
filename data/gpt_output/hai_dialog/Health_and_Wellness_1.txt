peaker A (NS):** Hi, Paeng! How have you been lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I am good, but, um, feeling little tired. You know, work is busy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I understand. Have you been taking care of yourself?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I try, but sometimes not easy. I want to be more healthy.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good goal! What have you tried so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I start to, um, eat more vegetable. But, um, I still eat too much sweet. It's difficult.

**Speaker A (NS):** It can be tough to change habits. Maybe you can start with small steps?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, small steps sound good. What do you think I should do first?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about reducing sugar little by little? Like, maybe cut down sugary drinks.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh yes, I like soda too much. It's hard, but I try, um, drink water more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Water is a great choice! Also, do you get enough sleep?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sleep? Um, sometimes not enough. I go to bed late because, uh, I watch TV.

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe you can set a regular bedtime, so you get enough rest?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Regular time... yes, that is good idea. I try to sleep early.

**Speaker A (NS):** How about exercise? Do you do any physical activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Uh, not much. I walk a little, but not often. Maybe I need more, um, movement?

**Speaker A (NS):** Walking is a good start. You could try a short walk each day to build a habit.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, short walk. I can do after work. I feel more energy, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, it helps a lot! And remember, small changes add up over time.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, I will try these. You give me good ideas!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Paeng! I'm here if you need more advice. Take care!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I will do my best. See you so
