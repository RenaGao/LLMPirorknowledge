cene: Two university students, Nuch (NS) and Lek (L2 Thai), are in a study group tackling a challenging topic in their environmental science course.**

**Nuch (NS):** Hey Lek, how are you finding the topic on climate change impacts for our presentation?

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Oh, Nuch... um, it is quite hard for me to... understand everything. Climate change have many, um, things to study, yes?

**Nuch (NS):** Yes, it does cover a lot! Let's break it down. Which part do you find most difficult?

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Um, the impact on... how to say... ice at the poles? How it melts.

**Nuch (NS):** Ah, the polar ice melting. It's a big issue. So, the ice at the poles is melting due to rising temperatures, right?

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes. And I think it cause sea level... um, increase?

**Nuch (NS):** Exactly, it causes sea levels to rise. Do you need help with understanding why that happens?

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Yes, please. I not sure how... um, melting ice make sea high.

**Nuch (NS):** Well, when the ice on land melts, it adds more water to the oceans. This extra water is what increases the sea level.

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Ah, I see. So, ice from land, not from water, right?

**Nuch (NS):** That's correct. Icebergs in the water don't change the sea level much when they melt.

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Thank you, I understand better now. And this is bad for city near ocean?

**Nuch (NS):** Yes, cities near the coast can face flooding. It's a real threat to those areas.

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Wow, very serious. How we can stop it?

**Nuch (NS):** Reducing greenhouse gases is key. Using less fossil fuels and switching to renewable energy helps.

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Renewable energy... like, um, solar and wind?

**Nuch (NS):** Yes, exactly! Solar and wind are great examples of renewable energy sources.

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Okay, I will talk about this in our presentation. Is it okay?

**Nuch (NS):** Absolutely, that sounds perfect. It’ll make our presentation very informative.

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Thank you, Nuch. You help me a lot. I feel more... um, ready now.

**Nuch (NS):** I’m glad to hear that, Lek. We’re going to do great!

**Lek (L2, Thai):** Yes, I think so too. Let's meet again to practice?

**Nuch (NS):** Definitely, let's meet tomorrow afternoon. How about 3 p.m.?

**Lek (L2, Thai):** 3 p.m. is good for me. See you then!

**Nuch (NS):** Alright, see you tomorrow, L
