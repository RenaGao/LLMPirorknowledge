peaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, hello. Yes, thank you. I am looking for... um, hotel. Hotel near here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think... it is Sunrise Hotel? I have it... uh, here on my phone.

**Speaker A (NS):** Let me see. Ah, yes, Sunrise Hotel. It’s not too far from here.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, good. Can you tell me how to go there?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. You’ll want to take a left at the next intersection.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Left... intersection. Uh, intersection is like... crossroad?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right. It's where two roads meet.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I see. And then, after left?

**Speaker A (NS):** After you turn left, go straight for about two blocks.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Two blocks, okay. What is block? Like... um, street?

**Speaker A (NS):** A block is the distance between two streets. It’s not far. Just a short walk.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I understand. So I go straight, two blocks...

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, and then you’ll see the hotel on your right side.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Right side, okay. Thank you very much!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Do you need any more help with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I think I am good now. Um... thank you, again.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I hope you enjoy your stay.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think I will. Have nice day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Safe trave
