peaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! I’ve been curious, could you tell me about your favorite holiday in Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes, hi! My favorite is Songkran. It is... how to say... Thai New Year.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Songkran! That sounds interesting. What do you usually do during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We have... um, water festival. We splash water for good luck. It is very fun!

**Speaker A (NS):** Splashing water sounds like a unique tradition. Is it celebrated all over Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, all over! In big city, um, very... crowded and big festival. In village, more... how to say, quiet?

**Speaker A (NS):** I see, so it’s a bit more relaxed in the villages. Do you have any special food during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we eat... um, Thai traditional food. Like... khao chae, it is rice with flower water and... um, side dish.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! How long does the celebration usually last?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It last three days. But sometime more long, depend on place.

**Speaker A (NS):** What’s your favorite part of the holiday?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like... um, meet family and friends. We have... how to say... gathering and eat together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful, spending time with loved ones. Do you also dress in any special way?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we wear... um, traditional clothes. It is very... colorful and nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Traditional clothes must make the celebration feel even more festive. Do you have any special memories of Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I remember when I... um, young. We play water in street and... um, everybody happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! Is there anything else about Songkran that you love?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I love that we... um, show respect. We pour water on elder hand for... how to say... blessing.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a beautiful tradition, showing respect to elders. Thank you for sharing, Lek! I’d love to experience Songkran someday.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You welcome! If you come to Thailand, I show you Songkran. It very ni
