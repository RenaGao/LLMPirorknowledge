peaker A (NS - Trainer):** Hi! It's great to see you today. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Uh, hello! I am fine, thank you. Excited to, um, start exercise.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** That's wonderful! Do you have any specific fitness goals in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hmm, I want to... how to say... be more strong and lose some weight.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** You want to build strength and lose weight. Got it! Have you done any workouts before?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I do yoga sometimes. And, um, running but not very fast.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Yoga and running are great! Do you prefer working out indoors or outdoors?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like outside. Fresh air is, um, how to say... better for me.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Fresh air is refreshing, definitely. How often do you want to train each week?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe three time a week? I can do more if it is okay.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Three times a week sounds like a good start! Do you have a preference for morning or evening workouts?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Morning, please. Before work is, um, how to say... good for my energy.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Morning workouts are energizing, indeed. Do you have any concerns or areas you want to focus on?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I worry about my knee. Sometimes it is... um, hurt when running.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Thanks for letting me know. We'll include exercises that are gentle on the knees. Does that sound okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is good. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Of course! We'll start with some warm-ups and strength training. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sounds good! I am ready to learn and, uh, try new thing.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Perfect! We'll take it step by step. Do you have any questions before we begin?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No question now. I am just, um, excited to start.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Great! Let's get started with a warm-up. Remember, take it at your own pace and enjoy the proce
