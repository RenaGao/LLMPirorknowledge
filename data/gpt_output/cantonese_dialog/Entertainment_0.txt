peaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, have you watched any good movies or TV shows lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, um, yes, Wing. I watched... how to say... the movie with big ship and iceberg?

**Speaker A (NS):** Titanic?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, Titanic! I see it many times. Very romantic and a little sad.

**Speaker A (NS):** It is a classic! What do you like most about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** The music... very beautiful. And the love story, it is... um, touching?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely touching. Do you prefer movies like that, or do you enjoy other genres too?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like many kinds! Action, comedy... but not horror. Too scary for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I understand. How about TV shows? Any favorites?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I watch Korean drama. They are, um, exciting and have good story.

**Speaker A (NS):** Korean dramas are very popular! Which one are you watching now?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It is called... uh, "Crash Landing on You." It is about... um, love and... how to say... adventure?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of it! It’s quite famous. What do you like about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** The characters are very... um, real? And the story is funny and romantic.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a great mix. Do you watch it with subtitles?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, subtitles help me understand. Sometimes I learn new words.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good way to improve language skills. Do you watch with family or friends?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Mostly alone, but sometimes with my sister. She love Korean drama too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice to share it with someone. Any plans to watch something new soon?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, maybe the... how to say... superhero movie? Avengers?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the Marvel movies! Those are fun to watch. I hope you enjoy it!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, Wing! I think I will like it very mu
