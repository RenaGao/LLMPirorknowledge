peaker A (NS):** Hey, Ming! How’s everything going?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi! Um, everything is okay. But I feel a bit... tired these days. Yeah.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, that’s not good. Are you getting enough sleep?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, not really. I sleep maybe... five hours a night? Busy with work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Five hours? That’s quite less. You should try for at least seven, you know?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I know. But hard to find time. How you manage your time?

**Speaker A (NS):** I plan my day ahead and try to stick to it. And I avoid screens before bed. Helps with better sleep.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Avoid screens... Ah, that’s good idea. I will try. Um, what else you do for health?

**Speaker A (NS):** I also exercise regularly. Even a short walk can make you feel energetic.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Stretching, yes. I can do that. Easy to start, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. And don’t forget to drink plenty of water. It’s easy to forget.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, water. I sometimes forget. Maybe put bottle on desk, hmm?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. Having it visible will remind you to drink.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think I can do these. Oh, and eat health... uh, healthy food?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, eating well is important too. More fruits and veggies, less fried stuff.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like fruits. Maybe I bring some to work for snack.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! It’s all about small changes, Ming. They add up.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, I will try these. You are very helpful always!

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! I’m happy to help. Let me know how it goes.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sure, I tell you. See you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you, take ca
