peaker A (NS):** Hi, Mei! Do you have a moment to chat about the birthday surprise for our friend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, of course! I was thinking about that too. What, um, ideas you have?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was considering a surprise party at her favorite restaurant. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, good idea. But do you think she... um, how to say... find out too early?

**Speaker A (NS):** We can keep it a secret by saying it's just a small dinner. Then surprise her with the party!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I see. That is smart! I will tell the others to keep quiet. Yes, keep quiet.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And do you think we should decorate the place?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! Maybe some... uh, balloons and... um, banners? You know, for happy birthday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Balloons and banners sound perfect. Should we get a cake, too?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, cake is must. She like... um, chocolate, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, chocolate cake is her favorite. Who will be in charge of ordering it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I can do that. I know a good bakery... um, near my house.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! And what about the guest list? Do we have everyone?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think so. I check again, just to be sure. Maybe ten people?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten sounds good! We also need to think about a gift. Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, she like... how to say... fashion? Maybe a scarf or something nice like that?

**Speaker A (NS):** A stylish scarf would be lovely! We can all chip in for something special.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, good. I will ask everyone for, um, money share.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, Mei. You're doing an amazing job organizing all this.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I hope she will be... um, very happy and surprised!

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure she will be thrilled. Let's make sure everything's set for Saturday.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, Saturday. I will confirm all the details and tell you soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good, Mei. Thanks for your help. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, see you Saturday! B
