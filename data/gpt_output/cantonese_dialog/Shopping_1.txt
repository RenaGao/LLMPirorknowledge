peaker A (NS):** Hello! I see you're interested in that teapot. It's a nice choice.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, it is very nice. Um, I like the color and... um, design.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! It's handmade. The price is $50. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, $50... um, how to say... it's a bit high for me. Can you make it lower?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. How about $45? It's a fair price for this quality.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, $45... still a bit much. Um, maybe $40?

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Well, since you like it so much, I can do $42. It's my best offer.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, $42... Let me think... Okay, I like it. I will take for $42.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I'm glad you found something you like. Do you need a gift wrap?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, uh, no need. It's for me... for myself.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, that's fine. Would you like to see anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, not now. But, um, can I ask about your store... open time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! We open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., every day.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** 9 to 6... okay, thank you. I will remember.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! If you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you very much. You are... um, very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** My pleasure. Enjoy your new teapot!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I will, thank you. Have a good day!
