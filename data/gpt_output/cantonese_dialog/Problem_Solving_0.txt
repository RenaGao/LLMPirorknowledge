peaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi, Wing! I am good, thank you. Um, I want to talk about our plan this weekend.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, what’s on your mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think you say you cannot go to the beach, right? Because, uh, you busy?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I think there might be a misunderstanding. I said I was free to go to the beach this Saturday.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I see! I hear wrong. I think you say you busy with work.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! I'm free and looking forward to it. Are you still interested in going?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! I want to go. I buy new swimsuit, very excited.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Do you want to meet at the usual spot by the bus station?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** 10 a.m. is okay. Not too early, not too late.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. We can enjoy the cool morning breeze.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like morning, not too hot. We can swim and eat food.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe, um, bring sunscreen? I forget mine last time.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Mei! I'm glad we cleared up the confusion.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I feel better now. I not want to miss our beach day.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me neither. I'm really looking forward to it. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, see you Saturday! Bye bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Mei! Take ca
