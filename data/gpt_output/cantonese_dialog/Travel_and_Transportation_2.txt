peaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, it’s great to see you. Have you thought about where we could go for our group vacation?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi! Um, yes, I think maybe we go to Japan? I hear it is very nice in spring with cherry flowers.

**Speaker A (NS):** Japan sounds amazing! Do you have any specific city in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, I think Tokyo is good. Many things to see, and food is... how to say... delicious?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, delicious! Tokyo is a great choice. What activities do you want to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I want to visit the big tower... um, what is it called? Ah, Tokyo Tower and maybe shop in Shibuya.

**Speaker A (NS):** Visiting Tokyo Tower and shopping in Shibuya sound fun. How about trying some traditional experiences, like a tea ceremony?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh yes, tea ceremony would be very interesting. I also want to try... uh, wearing kimono?

**Speaker A (NS):** Wearing a kimono is a wonderful idea. It really captures the cultural experience. How long are you thinking we should stay?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe one week? Enough time to see many places but not too long, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, a week should be perfect. Have you thought about where we could stay?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think we find... um, how to say... a place like home? Ah, Airbnb!

**Speaker A (NS):** An Airbnb is a great option. It can be more comfortable and homely than a hotel.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is good for group too. We can cook if we want, save money.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, it’s both economical and flexible. Do you know who else might join us?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I ask Wing and Tom. They say they want to come. More people, more fun!

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fantastic! More friends make it merrier. Do you have any concerns about the trip?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, maybe language? My Japanese not so good. But I think we can use apps.

**Speaker A (NS):** Language apps can definitely help. And a lot of people in Tokyo speak English too.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that makes me feel better. Thank you! When should we book everything?

**Speaker A (NS):** We should book soon, maybe by the end of this month. That way, we can get good deals.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, let’s plan to book by then. I am very excited for this trip!

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too, Mei! It’s going to be an amazing adventure. Let's keep in touch and finalize the details.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, let’s do that. Thank you for helping with the plans!

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Mei. Talk so
