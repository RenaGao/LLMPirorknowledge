peaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, do you have a moment to discuss the project deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, sure. I have time now. The deadline, um... the date was, I think, next Friday? 

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's correct. Next Friday. Do you feel comfortable with the timeline?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, it's a bit... how to say... tight? I worry cannot finish all by then.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Which parts are you concerned about?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** The testing part, I think. We need more, um, time to make sure everything working good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, testing is crucial. Can you estimate how much extra time you might need?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe, um, two more days? I think it will be enough.

**Speaker A (NS):** Two days sounds reasonable. Let's see if we can adjust the schedule.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I will work hard, uh, to make it on time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. Is there any additional support you need from the team?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe some help with... um, documentation? It's, uh, hard for me to write fast.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, we can arrange that. I’ll find someone to assist you.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** That is very helpful, thank you so much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Anything else you’d like to discuss about the project?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, no, I think that is all. I will focus on testing and, uh, tell if more problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Keep me posted on your progress. You’re doing well!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, I will. I work hard to finish.

**Speaker A (NS):** I appreciate your dedication, Mei. We'll make sure everything goes smoothly.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I hope so too. Thank you for understanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime. Let me know if anything changes. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! B
