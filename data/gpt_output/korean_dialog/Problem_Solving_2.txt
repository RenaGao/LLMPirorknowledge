peaker A (NS):** Hi Sunwoo, I noticed there was a little mix-up with the project files you sent earlier. 

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, um, I see. I am very sorry. What mistake is there?

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! It looks like the files were from last month, not this month. 

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I understand. I will check files again. Sorry for trouble.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s okay, Sunwoo. Mistakes happen. Do you need any help finding the correct files?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think I can find, but maybe I ask help if I cannot. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, just let me know. When do you think you can resend them?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I can send today, maybe in one hour? Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect. Thank you for being so prompt about it.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you for understanding. I make sure it not happen again.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re doing great, Sunwoo. We all make mistakes sometimes.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. I feel better now. 

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that. Is there anything else you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe, how to organize files better? 

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I can share some tips on that. Would you like to meet later to discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, please. That will help me very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! How about we set a time tomorrow? Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, tomorrow is good. What time you suggest?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 10 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** 10 a.m. is perfect. I will prepare questions for meeting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good, Sunwoo. Looking forward to it!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Me too. Thank you aga
