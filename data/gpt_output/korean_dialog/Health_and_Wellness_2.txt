**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that! What are your fitness goals?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I want to... lose weight and be strong. Maybe, um, build muscle?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great goals! How often do you plan to work out each week?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think... three times in a week? Is that good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's a good start. We can adjust it as you go. Have you done any exercises before?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Not much. I do some... um, walking and sometimes yoga.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good base. We can add some strength training. Do you know how to use the equipment here?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, not really. I see many machines... It is a little... um, confusing.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries. I’ll show you how to use them safely. Let's start with the treadmill. Have you used one before?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I try once, but... I not know speed setting well.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay. We’ll start slow. I’ll guide you. Now, what about your diet? Are you following any plan?
