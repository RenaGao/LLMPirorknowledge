peaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! Welcome to the team. Are you settling in okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. I am little... how to say... nervous, but excited.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's completely normal. Don’t worry, you'll do great. Let's go over your first task. Do you have any questions so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. What is my first, um, work?

**Speaker A (NS):** You'll be assisting with the market research report. Have you done something similar before?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, in university. We look at... um, how customers think? Is that right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We analyze customer behavior and preferences. We'll start with gathering data. Are you comfortable using Excel?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Excel is... okay for me. I am not expert, but I can learn fast.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great to hear. We have some tutorials you can check out if you need help. Do you know where to find them?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, no. Can you show me, please?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I’ll send you the link to our resource portal. It’s very useful. Do you have access to the company email?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I make account yesterday. Email is working.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll send it to you right after our meeting. For the report, we also need to create a summary. Have you done that before?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Summary, um, like a... short version of report?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly. Just a concise overview of the findings. We can go over it together once you’ve drafted it.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I will try. When should I finish?

**Speaker A (NS):** By next Friday would be great. If you need more time, just let me know.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I understand. I will work hard.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you will do a fantastic job. And remember, if you face any difficulties, just ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I feel more confident now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that! We all learn together. Let’s catch up again later this week.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, let’s do that. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Jisoo. Welcome aboa
