peaker A (NS):** Hi! So, you've mentioned you love cooking. What's your favorite meal to prepare?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I like to make, um, kimchi jjigae. It's, uh, kimchi stew. Very popular in Korea.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds delicious! How do you usually prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** First, I need, um, kimchi. And also pork. But sometimes, I use tuna can if no pork.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. So, you start with kimchi and meat. What comes next?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes. Then I put water, and maybe, um, tofu. I like tofu in my stew.

**Speaker A (NS):** Tofu sounds like a great addition. Do you add any spices?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, I use, uh, gochujang. It is like spicy paste. And also gochugaru, spicy powder.

**Speaker A (NS):** That must give it a nice kick. How long do you let it cook?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I cook maybe... 20 minute? Until everything is, uh, soft... and good flavor.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds simple and tasty. Do you serve it with anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, usually with rice. We eat with rice, and some, um, banchan. Side dish, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I love banchan! Do you make those yourself too?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sometimes, yes. But often, I buy. It is, uh, easier when busy.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Do you ever change the recipe?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes, sometimes I add, how to say... mushroom? For, uh, richer taste.

**Speaker A (NS):** Mushrooms are a nice touch. What type of mushrooms do you use?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I use, uh, shiitake mushroom. It is my favorite.

**Speaker A (NS):** Delicious choice. Is kimchi jjigae hard to make for beginners?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, not hard. It is easy! Just, um, practice make better taste.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Would you be willing to show me how to make it sometime?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Of course! I like to share. We can cook together next weekend?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. I can't wait to learn from you!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Great! I look forward to it too. Thank y
