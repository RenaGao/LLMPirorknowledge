peaker A (NS):** Hi Sunhee, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. So, are we ready to plan our group vacation?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think so. But, um, where we should go? I mean, the place, uh, destination?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good question. Do you have any ideas in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, maybe we can go to Jeju Island? I hear it's very beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Jeju Island sounds great! It's famous for its natural beauty. What activities would you like to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I want to see the, uh, mountain? Hallasan? And maybe beach, too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Visiting Hallasan and the beach sounds perfect. Do you think we should try any local foods?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes! I want to try, uh, black pork. It's special there, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, black pork is a must-try in Jeju. How about accommodation? Should we stay in a hotel or guesthouse?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm, maybe guesthouse? It is more, um, cozy? And we can meet other people.

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree, a guesthouse would be nice. When do you think is a good time to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe in spring? The weather, uh, not too hot, not too cold.

**Speaker A (NS):** Spring sounds perfect. Shall we go for a week or just a weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think one week is good. We can see many things, not rush.

**Speaker A (NS):** A week it is. How many people should we invite? Just our close friends?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, maybe, uh, six people? Enough for fun, not too many.

**Speaker A (NS):** Six sounds like a good number. I'll start making a list of things we need to prepare. 

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Great! I can help with, um, booking? Maybe the flight and our stay.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be fantastic. Thanks, Sunhee. Let's aim to finalize everything by next week.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sure, no problem! I will do my best. Thank you for planning with me.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's my pleasure. Looking forward to our tr
