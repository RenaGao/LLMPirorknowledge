peaker A (NS):** Hi there! I'm curious about Korean culture. Can you tell me about a tradition or festival that’s special in Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, of course. We have Chuseok. It is very important holiday, um, like Thanksgiving in America.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, interesting! What do people usually do during Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** People visit family. We, um, go to hometowns. And we eat special food. How to say... like rice cake.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, do you mean songpyeon?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, songpyeon! It is rice cake with, uh, sweet filling. We make with family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious. Is there anything else you do?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We also, um, visit ancestor's graves. It is called seongmyo. Very respectful time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Seongmyo, that must be a solemn moment. Do you have any other activities during Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we play games. Uh, one is yutnori, board game, very fun for family.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a lot of fun with family. Are there any traditional performances or events?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. There is, how to say... traditional dance. It is called ganggangsullae.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ganggangsullae? Can you describe it a bit?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It's a circle dance. Women hold hands and dance under full moon. It's from old history.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds beautiful. Is it common across Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Mostly, in southern Korea. But, now, many people know it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Are there any specific customs or clothing during Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we wear hanbok, traditional clothes. Very colorful and pretty.

**Speaker A (NS):** Hanbok must be beautiful to see. Do children enjoy Chuseok too?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes! Children get money as gift. We call it sebaetdon.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's nice! I'm sure they love that part. How long does Chuseok last?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is three days. But, uh, many people take longer holiday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for explaining Chuseok. I’d love to experience it someday.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, you should visit Korea during Chuseok! You can feel our culture.

**Speaker A (NS):** I definitely will. Thanks for sharing all these details with
