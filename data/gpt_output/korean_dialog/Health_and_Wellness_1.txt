peaker A (NS):** Hey, Sunmi! How are you doing these days?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, um, I am good, but little tired. Work... it is busy. 

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s important to take care of yourself. Are you getting enough rest?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Not really... I sleep late. Maybe... um... five hours? Not enough, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, five hours might be too little. Maybe you can try going to bed earlier?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I should try. But, uh, difficult to finish work early.

**Speaker A (NS):** How about setting a specific time to unwind? Like, no work after 9 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, good idea. I will... um, try this. Also, exercise is good, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Exercise can really help. Do you have time for a short walk or something?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I can walk. But, maybe... I need friend to walk together. Make it more fun?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice! Walking with a friend is great. Maybe I can join you sometime?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Really? That would be, um, very nice! Maybe... weekend?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, let’s plan for this weekend. Do you have a place in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm, maybe park near my home. It is... peaceful and, uh, not busy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Fresh air is always good. Do you eat healthy meals too?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I try, but... sometimes too much junk food. Like pizza, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** I get it. Maybe try adding more veggies to your meals? Little by little?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes, I can do that. Add more... um, salad and fruits.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Small changes make a big difference. How do you feel about cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like cooking! But, uh, simple things... like, stir-fry or soup.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Home-cooked meals are often healthier. We should exchange recipes sometime.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, that is good idea! Let’s do that. Thank you for advice, very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Sunmi! Let’s stay healthy together. See you on the weekend!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you! Thank you aga
