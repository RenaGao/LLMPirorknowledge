peaker A (NS):** Hey Xiao Li, how have you been lately?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Oh, um, I've been okay, I think. But, you know, feeling a bit tired every day.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Have you been getting enough rest and eating well?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Uh, not really. I sleep late... often, and eat too much... snacks.

**Speaker A (NS):** That can definitely affect your energy. Maybe try sleeping earlier and balancing your meals?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, I should try. But sometimes, I cannot stop watching... uh, how to say... TV shows?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, binge-watching! It's tempting. Maybe limit your screen time before bed?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, limit time. I think that's good idea. I will try.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Also, have you been exercising at all?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Exercise... um, not often. I walk, but not much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Walking is a good start. What about trying some light exercises at home?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Hmm, like... yoga? I hear it's good, but not sure how to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, yoga is excellent. There are lots of beginner videos online. You could try watching one.

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Oh, yes. I will look for video. Thank you, it sounds fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! And don't forget to stay hydrated, too.

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Oh, yes, drink more water. I often forget. I will use... um, timer to remind.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a smart idea. Little reminders can help a lot.

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Thank you, Xiao Ming. I will try these things. You always help me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Xiao Li! Let's both try to stay healthy, okay?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, stay healthy together. Thank you aga
