peaker A (NS):** Hi Li Wei, do you have a moment to discuss the project deadline?

**Speaker B (Mandarin NS):** Yes, of course. Um, the deadline is... how to say... coming soon, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's in two weeks. Are you on track with everything?

**Speaker B:** I think, yes. But some part is... um, taking more time. Uh, the design section is... a little slow.

**Speaker A:** I see. Is there anything specific that's causing the delay in the design section?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's... how to say... the software we use? It have, um, problem with compatibility.

**Speaker A:** Oh, the software issues can be tricky. Have you reached out to IT for help?

**Speaker B:** Uh, not yet. I plan to do it today. I think they can help fix... uh, problem quickly.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a good plan. Once that's resolved, do you think you'll be back on schedule?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I believe so. After fix, it should be... um, faster. But I need also more, um, time to test.

**Speaker A:** Okay, testing is important. Maybe we can reallocate some resources to help you speed things up?

**Speaker B:** Oh, yes! That would be... very helpful. Can we have, um, more people for testing?

**Speaker A:** Certainly, I can arrange for two more team members to assist you. Will that be enough?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that is good. With more help, we finish on time, I think.

**Speaker A:** Great! Let's schedule a quick meeting next week to check progress. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B:** Yes, next week is... um, good. Maybe Tuesday? I can update then.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. Tuesday it is. Let's aim to wrap everything up by Friday next week.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will make sure everything is, uh, ready by Friday.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need more support before then.

**Speaker B:** Thank you! I will, um, let you know if anything come up.

**Speaker A:** You're doing great, Li Wei. I appreciate your hard work.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much. I try my best! See you next week.

**Speaker A:** See you then! Have a good rest of your day.

**Speaker B:** You too! Bye-b
