peaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey, Xiao Li! How’s everything going? I was thinking about our conversation the other day about dining customs. Are you still interested in exploring more?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! Yes, I am very, uh, interested. It’s... um, very interesting to see how different places have different... customs?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, cultural differences are fascinating. Is there anything specific you want to know more about?

**Speaker B:** Um, yes. I wonder about, uh, how to say... table manner? In, uh, America. What is different?

**Speaker A:** Sure! In the U.S., it's common to keep your elbows off the table and to chew with your mouth closed. How about in China?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. In China, we use chopsticks, and, um, it's important to not stick them... uh, how to say... upright in rice.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's considered disrespectful, isn't it? Because it resembles incense at funerals?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. It’s, uh, not polite. Also, we like to share dish. Everything is, um, put in middle of table.

**Speaker A:** That’s a lovely way to enjoy a meal together. I’ve noticed that in some Western countries, people usually order their own individual plates.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I see. In Western, it is more, um, individual, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Each person often orders their own meal. But in China, it seems more communal?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we like to share. It is, um, more... how you say... social.

**Speaker A:** I like that. It brings everyone closer together. Are there any other customs you find interesting?

**Speaker B:** Um, how about... uh, tipping? In America, you leave, uh, extra money, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, tipping is common in restaurants in the U.S. Usually, around 15-20% of the bill.

**Speaker B:** Oh, in China, we do not usually tip. It is, um, not expected.

**Speaker A:** That’s interesting. It seems like tipping customs vary widely around the world.

**Speaker B:** Yes, very different. And, um, in America, people drink coffee more, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, coffee is very popular here. In China, is tea still the main beverage at meals?

**Speaker B:** Yes, tea is very common. We have many, uh, types of tea. It is, um, important in culture.

**Speaker A:** I’ve heard about tea ceremonies, too. They sound beautiful.

**Speaker B:** Yes, very, um, traditional and special. Maybe we can, uh, try someday together?

**Speaker A:** I would love that! Let’s plan it. Thanks for sharing, Xiao Li. It’s always enlightening to learn about these things.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, too! I learn a lot from you, and it is, um, fun to ta
