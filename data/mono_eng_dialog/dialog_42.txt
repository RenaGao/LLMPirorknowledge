**Speaker A:** Good afternoon, thank you for calling Tech Solutions. How can I assist you today?

**Speaker B:** Hi there, I'm having some trouble with my laptop. It keeps restarting unexpectedly. Can you help with that?

**Speaker A:** Certainly, that sounds frustrating. Let’s try to figure this out. When did the issue start happening?

**Speaker B:** It started yesterday after I installed some updates. I'm not sure if that's related, though.

**Speaker A:** It’s possible. Sometimes updates can cause conflicts. Have you tried restarting in Safe Mode to see if the problem persists?

**Speaker B:** I haven’t tried that yet. How do I start in Safe Mode?

**Speaker A:** No problem, I can walk you through it. First, shut down your laptop. Then, turn it back on and immediately keep pressing the F8 key until you see the Advanced Boot Options menu.

**Speaker B:** Got it, I’ll give that a try. And once I’m in Safe Mode, what should I be looking for?

**Speaker A:** Once you’re in Safe Mode, check if your laptop continues to restart. If it doesn’t, it might indicate a software issue. You can try uninstalling recent updates or drivers.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I’ll do that. If it still restarts, what’s the next step?

**Speaker A:** If it continues in Safe Mode, it might be a hardware issue. You could run a hardware diagnostic test or bring it in for a closer look.

**Speaker B:** Alright, that makes sense. I’ll try Safe Mode first and see how it goes. Thanks for your help!

**Speaker A:** You're welcome! Feel free to call back if you need further assistance. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** Thanks, you too!
