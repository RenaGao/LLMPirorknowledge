**Speaker A:** Good afternoon, welcome to our university admissions office. How can I assist you today?  

**Speaker B:** Hi, thank you. I'm here for my admission interview. A little nervous, to be honest!  

**Speaker A:** No need to worry. This is just a chance for us to get to know you better. Could you start by telling me why you chose to apply here?  

**Speaker B:** Sure, your university has a great reputation for its engineering program, and I’ve heard a lot about the innovative projects students get to work on.  

**Speaker A:** That's wonderful to hear. We do pride ourselves on hands-on learning. Are there any specific projects or areas within engineering you’re particularly interested in?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I'm really interested in renewable energy. I think it's crucial for our future, and I’d love to be part of that change.  

**Speaker A:** That's a commendable interest. We have several professors leading research in that field. Do you have any experience or projects related to renewable energy?  

**Speaker B:** I worked on a small solar panel project in high school. It was fascinating to see how much energy we could harness from the sun.  

**Speaker A:** Impressive! It sounds like you have a solid foundation. How do you see yourself contributing to our university community, both academically and socially?  

**Speaker B:** Academically, I hope to bring a fresh perspective and perhaps collaborate on innovative projects. Socially, I'm keen on joining the environmental club and maybe starting a new initiative related to sustainability.  

**Speaker A:** Those sound like great contributions. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me about the university or the program?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, actually. Could you tell me more about the support systems available for students, especially for those working on independent projects?  

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. We have a robust mentoring system and numerous grants available for student-led projects. Plus, our faculty are always eager to support and guide students.  

**Speaker B:** That’s reassuring to hear. Thank you for all the information. I feel much more confident now.  

**Speaker A:** I’m glad to hear that. It was a pleasure speaking with you, and we look forward to hopefully seeing you as part of our community.  

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much for your time. Have a great day!
