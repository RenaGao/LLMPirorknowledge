**Speaker A:** Good afternoon, and thank you for contacting our customer support. How can I assist you today?

**Speaker B:** Hi there! I’m having a bit of trouble with my internet connection. It’s been really slow, and I’m not sure what’s going on.

**Speaker A:** I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s see what we can do to improve it. Have you tried restarting your router yet?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I did that this morning, but it didn’t seem to help much.

**Speaker A:** Alright, no worries. Can you tell me if there are any lights flashing on your router, or are they solid?

**Speaker B:** The power light is solid, but the internet light keeps blinking.

**Speaker A:** That’s useful information, thank you. It sounds like there might be a connection issue. I’ll run a quick diagnostic from my end. Could you hold on for a moment?

**Speaker B:** Sure, no problem.

**Speaker A:** Thank you for waiting. It seems there might be a slight disruption in your area. We’re working on it, but in the meantime, could you try connecting your device directly to the router with a cable? This might help stabilize the connection.

**Speaker B:** I can definitely try that. How long do you think the issue will last?

**Speaker A:** We’re aiming to have it resolved within the next few hours. If the issue persists after that, feel free to reach out again, and we’ll look into it further.

**Speaker B:** Great, thank you for your help. I’ll try the cable connection and keep an eye on it.

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! If you need anything else, don’t hesitate to contact us. Have a wonderful day!

**Speaker B:** Thanks, you too!
