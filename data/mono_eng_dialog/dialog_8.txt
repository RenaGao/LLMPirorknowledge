**Speaker A:** Good afternoon! Thank you for calling Tech Solutions Support. How can I assist you today?  
**Speaker B:** Hi there! I’m having a bit of trouble with my laptop. It's been running really slow lately. Do you have any suggestions on what I might try?  
**Speaker A:** Certainly! Slow performance can be frustrating. Have you tried restarting your laptop or closing any unnecessary programs that might be running in the background?  
**Speaker B:** I’ve restarted it a couple of times, but I’m not sure about the programs. How can I check that?  
**Speaker A:** Great question! You can check which programs are running by opening the Task Manager. If you’re on Windows, press Ctrl + Shift + Esc. Are you able to see it now?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, I’ve got it open. Wow, there are a lot of things running. Should I just end everything?  
**Speaker A:** Not quite everything. Look for programs you recognize and aren’t using, like browsers or apps. Be careful not to close system processes.  
**Speaker B:** Okay, I see a bunch of tabs open in my browser. I’ll start with those.  
**Speaker A:** That sounds like a good plan. Once you close those, try running a disk cleanup to free up some space.  
**Speaker B:** Got it. I’ll give that a shot. Is there anything else I should be aware of?  
**Speaker A:** Also, ensure your antivirus software is up to date. Sometimes malware can slow things down, too.  
**Speaker B:** I’ll check on that as well. Thanks for all your help! Hopefully, these steps will make a difference.  
**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to give us a call back. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B:** Thanks, you too!
