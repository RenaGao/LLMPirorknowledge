**Speaker A:** Good morning! Thank you for calling, how can I assist you today?

**Speaker B:** Hi there, I have a few questions about my university application. I just want to make sure I’ve filled everything out correctly.

**Speaker A:** Of course, I’m happy to help. Have you completed the personal statement section yet?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I’ve done that. But I’m not sure if my references have been submitted. Can you check on that?

**Speaker A:** Sure thing. Let me pull up your application. Could you please provide your application ID?

**Speaker B:** It’s 1234567. I hope everything’s in order.

**Speaker A:** Thanks for that. I see that both references have been submitted. You’re all set on that front!

**Speaker B:** Oh, great! That’s a relief. I was also wondering about the status of my transcripts.

**Speaker A:** I understand. It looks like your transcripts have been received and processed. You’re in good shape there, too.

**Speaker B:** Awesome, thanks. One last thing—when should I expect to hear back about the decision?

**Speaker A:** Typically, decisions are sent out within six to eight weeks after the application deadline. You’ll be notified via email.

**Speaker B:** Perfect, I’ll keep an eye out for that. Thanks so much for your help!

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** Will do, thank you. You too!
