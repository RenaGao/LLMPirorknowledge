**Speaker A:** Good morning! Thank you for joining us today. How are you doing?  
  
**Speaker B:** Morning! I’m doing well, thank you. Excited to be here and learn more about the role.  
  
**Speaker A:** Great to hear. So, could you start by telling me a bit about your background and what drew you to apply for this position?  
  
**Speaker B:** Sure! I recently graduated with a degree in marketing and have been interning at a digital agency. I’m particularly interested in this role because of your focus on innovative campaigns.  
  
**Speaker A:** That’s wonderful. Our team values creativity. Could you give an example of a campaign you’ve worked on that you’re proud of?  
  
**Speaker B:** Absolutely. During my internship, I helped develop a social media strategy for a local charity. It increased their online engagement by 30% over three months.  
  
**Speaker A:** Impressive! What do you think was the key factor in that success?  
  
**Speaker B:** I believe it was our focus on storytelling. We crafted narratives that resonated with the audience, making the charity’s mission more relatable.  
  
**Speaker A:** Storytelling is indeed powerful. How do you handle challenges when a campaign doesn’t go as planned?  
  
**Speaker B:** I try to stay adaptable. I usually analyze what went wrong, gather feedback, and quickly pivot the strategy to better align with the audience’s needs.  
  
**Speaker A:** That’s a great approach. Lastly, do you have any questions for us about the team or the company?  
  
**Speaker B:** Yes, what does success look like for someone in this role after the first year?  
  
**Speaker A:** Good question. Success would mean leading a project from start to finish and significantly contributing to the growth of our brand's online presence.  
  
**Speaker B:** That sounds exciting. Thank you for sharing that. I’m eager to contribute to the team’s success.  
  
**Speaker A:** We’re glad to hear that. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll be in touch soon about next steps.
