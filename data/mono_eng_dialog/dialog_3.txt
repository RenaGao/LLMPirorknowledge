**Speaker A:** Hi, welcome to our admissions office. How can I assist you today?  
**Speaker B:** Hello! I’m here for my interview regarding the master's program in Environmental Science. I believe it’s scheduled for 10 a.m.?  
**Speaker A:** Yes, absolutely. I’m glad you’re here. Could you please confirm your full name for me?  
**Speaker B:** Sure, it’s Emily Johnson.  
**Speaker A:** Thank you, Emily. Let’s get started then. Could you tell me a bit about your background and why you’re interested in our program?  
**Speaker B:** Certainly! I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology and have a keen interest in sustainability and conservation. I’m drawn to your program because of its strong focus on practical fieldwork and research opportunities.  
**Speaker A:** That sounds impressive. Our fieldwork component is indeed a highlight. Have you had any hands-on experience in this area before?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, I interned with a local conservation group last summer, where I contributed to habitat restoration projects. It was a rewarding experience.  
**Speaker A:** That’s great to hear. Real-world experience is invaluable. How do you see that internship influencing your studies if you join us?  
**Speaker B:** It taught me the importance of community engagement in environmental projects, and I hope to incorporate that perspective into my studies and future research here.  
**Speaker A:** Excellent! We value students who bring such insights. Do you have any questions about the program or the university?  
**Speaker B:** I’m curious about the mentoring opportunities. How accessible are faculty members for guidance and support?  
**Speaker A:** Our faculty are very approachable and supportive. We encourage students to reach out regularly, and many professors offer open office hours. Would you like to meet with any faculty members today?  
**Speaker B:** That would be wonderful, if possible! I’d love to connect with someone from the environmental policy faculty.  
**Speaker A:** I’ll see if Professor Adams is available. In the meantime, feel free to explore our campus. It’s a beautiful day for a walk!  
**Speaker B:** Thank you so much for your help. I’m feeling even more excited about the possibilities here!
