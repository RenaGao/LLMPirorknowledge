**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! My favorite is... um, how to say... egg with rice and meat.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, fried rice with eggs and meat?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! Fried rice! I make it often because it is... easy and tasty.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious. Can you tell me how you make it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay. First, I cook rice before. Then, I fry egg in pan until... until it is soft. After, I add meat—usually pork—and cook until it is... um, no more pink.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. So, the rice is already cooked, and you add the eggs and meat.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes. Then, I mix everything in pan and add... um, soy sauce and salt. Also, I like to put some green onion for... for smell.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Nice! So, soy sauce, salt, and green onions for flavor. Is there anything else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um... sometimes I add little bit... um, sesame oil? It makes more... more tasty.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sesame oil is a great idea. It adds a nice flavor. How long does it usually take you to make it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Not long. Maybe... 20 minutes? If I prepare rice before, it is very fast.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s quick! It sounds like a great meal for a busy day.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, very good for busy day. And you can... you can change meat or add vegetable if you want.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really flexible. I think I’ll try making it sometime.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I can teach you if you want!  
**Speaker A (NS):** That would be really helpful. Thanks for sharing your recipe!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No problem! I like talking about food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Let’s plan to cook together soon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, sounds good. See you later!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you later! Have a great day.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! Bye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Looking forward to trying your fried rice.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Me too! Let’s do it next week.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let’s plan for next week then. Goodbye!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Goodbye! See you soon!
