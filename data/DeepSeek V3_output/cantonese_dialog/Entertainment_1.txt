**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi! No plan yet. Maybe we can... um, go out?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! What do you feel like doing? Dinner, maybe?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, dinner is good. I want eat... um, Chinese food?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! Do you have a favorite restaurant in mind?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** There is one in Central. It is... um, how to say... very delicious.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect. What time should we meet?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** How about... um, seven o’clock? Not too early, not too late.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Seven works for me. After dinner, do you want to do something else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! Maybe we can... um, walk by the harbor? The view is very nice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. The lights at night are beautiful.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! And we can... um, take some photo.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll bring my camera. Let’s make it a fun evening!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Good idea! I am... um, excited.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. So, we’ll meet at the restaurant at seven, then?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, seven o’clock. I will... uh, see you there.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. See you then!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, one more thing—do you want to invite anyone else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm... maybe, um, Mei? She also like Chinese food.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, let’s ask her. I’ll text her now.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay! If she can come, it will be... um, more fun.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. Alright, I’ll let you know if she confirms.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! Then... until seven, we see each other.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Looking forward to it!
