 Ensure the L2 speaker has intermediate-level English proficiency and the NS speak simply for easy understanding..

**NS**: Hi there! How’s it going?  

**L2 (Cantonese)**: Ah, I’m okay, but I have problem with my internet. It’s not working for two days now.  

**NS**: Oh no, that’s frustrating. Have you tried contacting your service provider?  

**L2**: Yes, I call them yesterday, but they... um... how to say... they not help much. They say they check, but nothing change.  

**NS**: That’s annoying. Did they give you a timeline for when it will be fixed?  

**L2**: No, they just say “we look into it.” But I need internet for work. It’s very... uh... important.  

**NS**: I understand. Maybe you can ask to speak to a supervisor? Sometimes that helps.  

**L2**: Supervisor? Ah, yes, maybe I will try that. But I feel... um... nervous to speak more.  

**NS**: That’s okay! Just be polite but firm. You’re paying for the service, so it’s okay to ask for help.  

**L2**: Okay, I will try. Maybe I say, “Can I talk to someone... uh... higher position?”  

**NS**: That’s perfect! Or you could say, “Can I speak to a manager?”  

**L2**: Yes, manager! I will say that. Thank you for helping me.  

**NS**: No problem. Let me know how it goes.  

**L2**: I will. If they don’t fix it, maybe I... uh... change company.  

**NS**: That’s a good idea. Sometimes switching providers is the best solution.  

**L2**: Yes, but first I try again with manager. Thank you so much for your advice!  

**NS**: You’re welcome. Good luck, and I hope your internet gets fixed soon.  

**L2**: Me too. Bye for now!  

**NS**: Bye! Take care!
