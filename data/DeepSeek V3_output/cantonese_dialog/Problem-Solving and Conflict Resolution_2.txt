**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Mei. I heard you’re having some trouble with the new project timeline. Do you want to talk about it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, thank you. The timeline is... um, too short. I think we need more time, but I don’t know how to say to team.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So you’re feeling the deadline is too tight?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes. It’s... how to say... stressful. And the task is very big.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Maybe we can break it into smaller steps. What do you think?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, good idea. Smaller steps... easier to do. But how to tell team? I worry they not agree.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry. You can say, “This is a complex project, so breaking it into smaller tasks will help us finish on time.”  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, okay. Complex project... smaller tasks. I will try to say like this.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Is there anything else you’re concerned about?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes. The team... sometimes they not listen to me. Maybe because my English not good.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Your English is fine, Mei. If they don’t listen, just say calmly, “I have an idea to improve the project.” Confidence is key.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I will try. Thank you for help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let’s summarize: break the project into smaller tasks, explain it calmly to the team, and be confident. Does that sound right?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, sounds good. I will try this way.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let me know if you need more help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, thank you so much. I feel better now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good to hear! Have a great day, Mei.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too. Bye-bye!  

(Conversation ends with a clear summary and polite goodbye.)
