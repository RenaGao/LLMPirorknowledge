**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Wing! Do you have a moment? I want to talk about the project deadline.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, sure. I have time. What about the... um, deadline?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The project is due next Friday. How’s it going so far?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, next Friday... um, I think it is okay. I finish... uh, about half already. But some part is... how to say... difficult.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Which part is difficult? Maybe I can help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** The data... um, data analysis. I need more time to check the numbers.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Data analysis can be tricky. Would it help if I assign someone to assist you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that is good idea. Thank you. But I think... um, if I have two more days, maybe I can finish.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I can extend the deadline to next Monday. Does that work for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Monday is... um, okay. I will try my best to finish.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Let me know if you need anything else.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, thank you. I will... um, ask if I have problem.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I think that is all. Thank you for your help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Let’s aim for Monday, then. See you soon!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you soon! Thank you again.
