**Speaker A (NS)**: Hey, Li! I’m glad we’re finally planning this surprise for Elena. Do you have any ideas for the party?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, yes! I think we can do... um, decoration with balloons and flowers. Elena like flowers very much.
**Speaker A (NS)**: That’s a great idea! Balloons and flowers will make the room look festive. What about food? Should we cook or order something?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Cooking is good, but maybe difficult for us. Maybe we order... uh, how to say... pizza? Or Chinese food? Elena love Chinese food.
**Speaker A (NS)**: Chinese food sounds perfect! Elena will definitely enjoy that. Should we get a cake too?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, cake is important for birthday. Maybe chocolate cake? Elena favorite is chocolate.
**Speaker A (NS)**: Chocolate cake it is! Now, what about activities? Should we play games or just hang out?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Games are fun! Maybe we can play... um... how to say... guessing game? Or cards?
**Speaker A (NS)**: A guessing game sounds fun! We can make it Elena-themed, so it’s personal. What time should everyone come? 
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Elena finish work at 6. Maybe we start at 7? So we have time to prepare.
**Speaker A (NS)**: 7 p.m. works for me. We’ll have an hour to set everything up. Oh, and we should keep it a secret, right?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, yes! Must keep secret. No one tell her, or... surprise is gone.
**Speaker A (NS)**: Exactly! Let’s make sure everyone knows not to say anything. Should we send out a group message to confirm the plan?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, good idea. I can write the message. Then everyone know their... um... duty? 
**Speaker A (NS)**: Perfect! You can assign tasks in the message, like who’s bringing decorations or ordering the food. 
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Okay, I will do it. This plan is very good. I think Elena will be very happy.
**Speaker A (NS)**: I think so too! Thanks for all your ideas, Li. Let’s make this the best surprise ever.
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, thank you also. Let’s make it special for Elena. See you on Saturday!
**Speaker A (NS)**: See you then! Bye for now!
