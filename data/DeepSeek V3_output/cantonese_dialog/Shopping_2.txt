**Conversation: Discussing a Product Return Policy**

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How can I help you today?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello! I have, um, problem with this thing. I buy it last week, but it is not working.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sorry to hear that. Could you show me the product and the receipt?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, here it is. Receipt is... um, somewhere. Ah, here!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thank you. Let me check. Okay, this is within our return policy. Did you want to exchange it or get a refund?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I want to... um, exchange it, please. If possible.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Let’s see if we have the same model in stock.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, okay. Thank you. Do I need to... um, pay more money if they have new one?  
**Speaker A (NS):** No, as long as it’s the same item, there’s no additional cost.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** That’s good. I hope they have it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Let me check for you. [Pauses to check inventory] Yes, we do have it! I’ll get it for you right away.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, great! So, I just give you this one and take the new one?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. I’ll process the exchange for you now.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you so much. You are very helpful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Is there anything else I can help with today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, that’s all. Thank you again.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care.
