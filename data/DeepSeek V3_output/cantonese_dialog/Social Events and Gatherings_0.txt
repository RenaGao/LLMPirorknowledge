**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I don’t think we’ve met. I’m Sarah.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello, Sarah. My name is... um, Ming. Nice to meet you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you too, Ming. Are you new to this neighborhood?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I just move here last month. Still... um, how to say... not so familiar?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Moving can be tough. Where did you live before?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I live in Hong Kong before. It is... um, very different here.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure it’s a big change! What do you do for work, Ming?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I work in... um, IT. I fix computer and, uh, make program.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! Do you enjoy it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like it. Sometimes is... um, challenge? But I enjoy solve problem.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great. And what do you like to do outside of work?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like to cook. In Hong Kong, I often cook dim sum. Here, I try to learn... um, Western food?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I love dim sum! Cooking is a wonderful hobby. Have you met many people here yet?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Not so many. I am... um, a little shy. But I want to make more friend.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear. I’m sure you’ll settle in soon. If you ever need anything, feel free to ask me.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, Sarah. You are very kind.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Ming. It was really nice meeting you. Let’s stay in touch!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, nice meeting you too. I hope we can... um, talk again soon.
