 **Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Mei! Do you have a moment to talk about the homework assignment?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I have time. But I have some question about the task.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, what’s unclear to you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, the part about... how to say... the last question. I don’t understand what it mean.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you mean question 5?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, question 5. It say, "analyze the impact"... but I don’t know what "impact" mean here.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, "impact" means the effect or influence something has. You need to explain how the situation affects the people or thing involved.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I see. So I need to say... how it change the situation?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You’re explaining the changes caused by the situation.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I think I understand now. But also, the grammar... is it "cause" or "caused"?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! Since it’s in the past, you should use "caused."  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, "caused." Thank you, teacher.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Is there anything else you need help with?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I think it’s clear now. Thank you for your help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let me know if you have more questions later.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I will. Thank you, teacher. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Mei! Have a great day.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too, teacher. See you next class.
