**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! So, I think it’s time to plan our group vacation. Any ideas for a destination?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! I thinking... maybe beach? Many sun, very relaxing.  
**Speaker A (NS):** A beach destination sounds nice. Do you have a specific place in mind?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um... how to say... Bora Bora? Or maybe Bali? I hear Bali is very beautiful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Both are great options! Do you prefer one over the other?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think Bali is better. More, um... budget-friendly. And it have many activities.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. What kind of activities would you like to do there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I want to... um... swim in the sea. And also see temple. And maybe try local food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Temples, food, and swimming—perfect mix. How about shopping?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, shopping also good! I like to buy... uh, souvenirs for family.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great. How long do you think we should stay there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe one week? Not too long, but enough to relax and see things.  
**Speaker A (NS):** A week sounds perfect. Should we look for hotels or maybe a villa?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Villa is better, I think. More private, and we can cook if we want.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. Should we split the cost evenly?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, split cost is fair. We can share everything.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. Oh, and what’s a good time to go?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe September? Weather is good, and not too many people.  
**Speaker A (NS):** September works for me. So, Bali, 1 week, villa, and lots of activities—sounds like a plan!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I’m very excited! Thank you for organizing this.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! I’ll start looking into flights and accommodations. Let’s chat again soon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, see you soon! Bye-bye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Looking forward to our Bali trip!
