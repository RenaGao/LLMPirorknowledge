 

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, thank you! I... um, I look for the big clock tower. Is it near here?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The clock tower? Oh, you mean the town hall clock? Yes, it’s quite close!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, town hall clock. How to walk there?  
**Speaker A (NS):** You just go straight down this road for about five minutes, and then turn left at the traffic light. You’ll see it right away.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Straight... then left at the... um, light for cars?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly! Turn left at the traffic light. It’s a big red building, so you can’t miss it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I see. Red building. Thank you very much!  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Do you need any help with anything else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um... maybe... is there a good place to eat near the clock?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, yes! There’s a nice café just next to the town hall. They have great sandwiches and coffee.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, good! I like sandwiches. How to find the café?  
**Speaker A (NS):** When you get to the clock tower, the café is on the right side of the building. Just walk around the corner, and you’ll see it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** So, café is on the right... near the clock. Thank you again!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Enjoy your visit to the clock tower and the café.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will enjoy it. Thank you so much for helping!  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s no trouble at all. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
