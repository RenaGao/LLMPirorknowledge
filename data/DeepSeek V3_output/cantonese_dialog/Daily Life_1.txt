 

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, nice to see you! I heard you’re planning a picnic with your family this weekend. How’s it going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, thank you! We plan to go to… um, the park. But I need some help to decide what to bring.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Have you thought about food yet?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, but not sure. Maybe sandwiches? And some fruit… like apple or banana.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great choices! What kind of sandwiches are you thinking?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, chicken sandwich? Or maybe egg sandwich. My family like both.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect. How about drinks?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes! We will bring… how to say… uh, water and juice. And maybe tea in bottle.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Tea in a thermos? That’s a good idea. What about snacks?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Snacks? Ah, maybe… how to say… chips? And some cake for dessert.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a feast! Don’t forget a blanket to sit on.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes! Thank you for remind me. We have blanket at home. I will bring it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Anything else you need help with?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe… um, how about game? What game we can play in park?  
**Speaker A (NS):** You could bring a frisbee or a ball. Or even cards if you want something simple.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, frisbee is good idea. My family like to play frisbee. I think they will enjoy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect. Sounds like you’re all set for a great picnic!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, thank you so much for your help! I feel more ready now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I hope you and your family have a wonderful time.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! We will enjoy it. See you next time!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you! Bye!
