**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, everyone! Thanks for coming. Let’s plan a surprise party for our friend Jenny. Does anyone have ideas?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. I think... we can have party at her home? Or maybe, um, restaurant?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! I think her house would work better for a surprise. What do you think we should do for food?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I can cook... um, Chinese food? Like dumplings and fried rice. Or we can order pizza, it is easy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! If you cook, let’s pair it with pizza too, so there’s enough for everyone. What about decorations?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, decorations... I can buy balloons and, um, thing for making color... uh, how to say?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Streamers?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, streamers! I will buy balloons and streamers.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll handle the cake. Should we invite everyone this Saturday at 2 p.m.?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, Saturday is good. Jenny no work that day. Um, how we surprise her?  

**Speaker A (NS):** We can all hide when she comes home, then jump out and say, “Surprise!”  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I like that idea! It will be very fun.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed! Let’s split the tasks: you handle decorations and food, I’ll get the cake and send invites, and we’ll all meet at her house at 1 p.m. to set up.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I understand. I will buy decorations tomorrow and cook on Saturday morning.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Thanks for your help. This is going to be amazing.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think Jenny will be very happy. Thank you for organizing.  

**Speaker A (NS):** My pleasure! Let’s touch base on Friday to confirm everything.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I will message you on Friday. See you then!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you! Let’s make this a party Jenny will never forget.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, definitely. Bye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
