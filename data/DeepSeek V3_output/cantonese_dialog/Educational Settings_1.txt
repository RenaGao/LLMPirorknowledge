**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Mei! How are you doing? I heard we have a test coming up next week.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, I know. I feel... um, a little nervous about it. The test is for biology, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right, biology. Have you started studying yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, but I feel... how to say... not enough? I read the book, but some part is hard to understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Maybe we can study together? I find it helpful to explain things to each other.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Really? That is good idea! When you want to study?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this Saturday afternoon? We can meet at the library.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, Saturday afternoon... um, I have... uh, lunch with my family. Maybe after 2 p.m.?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, 2 p.m. works for me. What do you think we should focus on first?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe the... um, thing about cells? Like, how they work? I think it is important for the test.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea. We can go over the cell structure and functions. I’ll bring some notes to share.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I also have... um, flashcards. Maybe we can use them to test each other?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Flashcards are a great way to memorize details. Do you have any specific topics you’re struggling with?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes, the part about... um, DNA and RNA. It is so confusing for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry, I’ll explain it step by step. We can compare it to something simpler, like a recipe.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, recipe! That make sense. Thank you for helping me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Studying together makes it easier for both of us. So, Saturday at 2 p.m., library?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will be there. Thank you so much, I feel more... um, confident now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! See you then, and don’t stress too much. We’ve got this.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you Saturday! Thank you, goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Mei! Take care!
