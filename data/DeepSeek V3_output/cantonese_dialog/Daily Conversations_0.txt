**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Ah, yes, my favorite hobby is... um, taking photo. I like to take photo... uh, of nature and people.  

**Speaker A (NS)**: Photography! That’s a great hobby. What kind of nature scenes do you enjoy photographing the most?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: I like... uh, mountains and sea. In Hong Kong, we have many beautiful places, like... uh, Sai Kung. It’s very pretty.  

**Speaker A (NS)**: Sai Kung sounds lovely. Do you go there often to take pictures?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, I go there... uh, maybe one time every month. I like to go early morning because... um, light is very good for photo.  

**Speaker A (NS)**: That makes sense—early morning light is perfect for photography. Do you use a specific camera or just your phone?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: I use DSLR camera. It’s... um, how to say... better quality than phone. But sometimes I use phone for quick photo.  

**Speaker A (NS)**: That’s cool! Have you ever shared your photos with others, like on social media or in exhibitions?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, I share on Instagram. But I never have exhibition. Maybe one day, I hope.  

**Speaker A (NS)**: I’m sure your photos are amazing. What do you enjoy most about photography?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: I like... um, how to say... capture moment. When I take photo, I feel... uh, happy and relax. Also, I can keep memory forever.  

**Speaker A (NS)**: That’s beautiful—capturing moments and preserving memories. Do you edit your photos after taking them?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, I use Lightroom. It’s... um, software for edit photo. I like to adjust color and... uh, make it more pretty.  

**Speaker A (NS)**: Lightroom is a great tool. Do you have a favorite photo you’ve taken?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, I have one photo in Sai Kung. It’s... um, sunrise with sea and small boat. I think it’s my best photo.  

**Speaker A (NS)**: That sounds stunning! I’d love to see it sometime. Photography seems like a great way to express yourself.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Thank you! Yes, it’s very fun and creative. I hope to learn more and... um, improve my skill.  

**Speaker A (NS)**: I’m sure you’ll keep getting better. Thanks for sharing about your hobby—it was really interesting to hear!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Thank you! I enjoy talk about it. Maybe next time I show you some photos!  

**Speaker A (NS)**: That would be great! Looking forward to it. Have a wonderful day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: You too! Goodbye!
