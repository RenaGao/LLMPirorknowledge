**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Wing, thanks for meeting with me today! I heard you’re planning a cultural event to share your traditions. Can you tell me more about it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! I want make event to... um, how to say... let people know about Cantonese culture.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! What kind of activities are you thinking of?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe we can have... um, traditional dance? And also, um... food. Cantonese food is very famous, you know!  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true. Food and dance are always popular. What kind of dance?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It is called... lion dance. Very exciting! People wear lion costume and move like lion.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve seen that before. It’s really impressive! What about the food? Any specific dishes?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we can have dim sum, and also... um, roast duck. Very tasty!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds delicious! When are you planning to hold the event?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think... maybe next month? But I need find place first.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. Do you need help with the venue or organizing?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, please! I not sure how to... um, book the place.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I can help with that. We can look for a community center or park.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, thank you! Community center... that is good idea.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Are there any other traditions you want to include?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um... maybe we can have... how to say... tea ceremony? Cantonese people like drink tea.  

**Speaker A (NS):** A tea ceremony would be lovely. It’s very peaceful and elegant.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! And we can explain about tea culture.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect. So, to summarize, we’ll have lion dance, dim sum, roast duck, and a tea ceremony?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, exactly! Thank you for help.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let’s meet again next week to finalize the details.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, that sounds good. See you next week!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Take care.
