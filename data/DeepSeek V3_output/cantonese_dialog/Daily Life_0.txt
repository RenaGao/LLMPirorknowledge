**Speaker A (NS):** Good morning! How’s your morning going so far?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Good morning! My morning is... um, okay. I wake up at 7, then I eat breakfast.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice. What do you usually have for breakfast?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I eat... um, congee. And also toast. Sometimes fruit.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Congee and toast—that’s a good mix! Do you drink tea or coffee?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I drink tea. Green tea. But coffee... um, not so much. It makes me... how to say... too awake?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Too jittery?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, jittery! I don’t like that feeling.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Fair enough. What do you do after breakfast?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I... um, take shower. Then I go to work.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Do you walk or take public transport?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I take MTR. It is... um, faster than walking.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the MTR is convenient. How long is your commute?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** About... um, 30 minutes. Sometimes more if it is busy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s not too bad. Do you listen to music or read during the ride?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I listen to music. Um, Cantonese pop songs. They are very... relaxing.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. Do you have a favorite artist?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like... um, Eason Chan. His songs are... how to say... touching?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Emotional?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, emotional! I like that.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great. Thanks for sharing your morning routine with me!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you for listening! I enjoy talking with you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Have a wonderful day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too. See you later!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you!
