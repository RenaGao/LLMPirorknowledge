  

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I see you’re looking at that laptop. Are you thinking of buying it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think it’s... um, maybe good for me. But I not sure about some feature.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What features are you unsure about?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** First, the... uh, storage? It says 512GB. Is it enough for many files?  

**Speaker A (NS):** It depends on what you need it for. If you’re storing lots of videos or big programs, you might need more. But for documents and photos, 512GB should be fine.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I see. And the RAM... it’s 16GB. Is it enough for... um, multitask?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, 16GB is great for multitasking. You can run several programs at once without slowing down.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** That’s good! Also, the battery life... it says 10 hours. Is it real?  

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s usually not exactly 10 hours in real use, but it should last most of the day with normal tasks.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I understand. And the... um, screen size? It’s 15 inches. Is it too big for carry around?  

**Speaker A (NS):** A 15-inch laptop is a bit larger, but it’s still portable. If you want something smaller, maybe a 13-inch would be better.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, I think 15 inches is okay. I like bigger screen for work.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense! Do you have any other questions?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I think... um, that’s all. Thank you for helping me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! It seems like a good choice for your needs.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think I will buy it. Thank you so much!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Hope you enjoy your new laptop. Have a nice day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! See you later!
