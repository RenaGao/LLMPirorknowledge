**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for chatting with me today. Is there a skill you’d like to learn?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, thank you. I want to learn… um… cooking.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Cooking is a great skill! Why is it important to you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Because I want to make healthy food. Now I eat… um, outside food too much. Not good for health.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good point. Do you have a specific type of cooking you’d like to learn?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I want to cook… Chinese food. My family always cook at home, but I never learn.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a meaningful goal. Do you have a favorite dish you’d like to learn first?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I like stir-fry vegetables. But I don’t know how to use… the pan properly. The heat is always… too much or too little.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Controlling the heat can be tricky. Have you tried watching cooking videos to help?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I watch YouTube. But sometimes… um, I don’t understand the English words.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s totally normal. Maybe you could find videos with subtitles or in Cantonese to make it easier.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** That’s good idea. I will try. Also, I need to practice more. Now I just… um, boil noodles.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Practice makes perfect. Maybe you can start with simple recipes and build from there.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think so. Cooking is important because… it can make me feel happy and healthy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree. It’s a rewarding skill. Do you have anyone to cook with?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, my sister. She also want to learn. We can practice together.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Learning with someone makes it more fun.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think so too. Thank you for listening to my… um… plan.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! It was nice talking with you. Good luck with your cooking journey!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I will try my best. See you next time!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you! Take care!
