**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can you tell me about a recent event that was memorable for you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! Last week, I go hiking. It was... um, very beautiful place.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, where did you go hiking?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It was in Tai Mo Shan. Um, highest mountain in Hong Kong.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! What made it memorable for you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** The view was... how to say... very wow. I see many trees and clouds. And the air was... um, very fresh.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I bet it was refreshing. How did you feel during the hike?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** At first, I feel tired. But after some time, I feel... uh, happy and strong. Like, my mind is clear.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. Did you go with anyone?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I go with my friend. We talk a lot and... um, laugh together. It was good time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a great experience. Was there a specific moment that stood out?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! When we reach the top, the sun was setting. The sky is... um, orange and pink. Very beautiful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds breathtaking. How did you feel in that moment?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I feel peaceful. Like, all my... um, problem is gone.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad it had such a positive effect on you. Would you do it again?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I want to go again. Maybe next month.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a plan. Thank you for sharing such a lovely memory with me!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you for listen to me. It was nice talking.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Take care and enjoy your next hike!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too. Goodbye!
