**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can you tell me about your favorite place to visit?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes. My favorite place is… uh, beach. I like the beach very much.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s nice! Which beach is it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It is… Repulse Bay. In Hong Kong. Near my home.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds convenient. What do you like about Repulse Bay?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like… um, the sea is very clear. And the sand is soft. Also, there are many trees. It is… um, relaxing.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. Do you do anything special there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I swim. And sometimes I… how to say… lie on the sand and… um, listen to music.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sunbathing and listening to music?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! Sunbathing. And I also like to eat… um, snacks. There are… small shops selling food.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a perfect day out. Is it usually crowded there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, yes, sometimes. But I go early morning. Then not many people. And it’s… um, cooler.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a smart idea. Do you go there often?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, almost… every week. It’s my… um, happy place.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I can see why. It sounds like a great spot to relax and enjoy nature.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I feel… very calm there. I forget all… um, problems.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really nice. I think everyone needs a place like that.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, you also should visit. It is… um, very beautiful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll definitely add it to my list if I’m ever in Hong Kong. Thanks for sharing!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You are welcome! Thank you for listening.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! It was great hearing about your favorite place.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I am happy to talk about it. Um, have a nice day!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Take care and enjoy your next visit to Repulse Bay.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I will. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
