**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Mei! How’s it going? Are you ready for the exam next week?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, hello! I am... um, not so ready yet. I feel a little... how to say... nervous?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry, I think everyone feels the same. Which part are you most worried about?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think math part is most difficult. I understand some, but the... uh, equation? Very hard for me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the algebra equations? Yeah, they can be tricky. Have you been practicing?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I practice every day, but sometimes I forget the... um, steps? Like, how to solve it step by step.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Maybe we can study together? I can help explain the steps.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Really? That will be very helpful! Thank you, thank you. When we can... um, meet?  

**Speaker A (NS):** How about tomorrow after class? We can go to the library.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Tomorrow after class is good for me! Yes, I will come.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Bring your notes and any problems you’re stuck on.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I will bring... um, all my papers. And also, I have some question about the... uh, geometry part.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, we’ll go over everything. Don’t stress too much—once you get the hang of it, it’ll feel easier.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I hope so! Thank you for helping me. I feel better now.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! We’re in this together. So, tomorrow after class at the library?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, tomorrow after class. I will see you there!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. See you tomorrow, Mei!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you, and thank you again! I will be ready.
