**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Mei! I’ve been meaning to ask you, what’s your favorite holiday in your country?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh! My favorite holiday... um, is Lunar New Year. It is very special for us.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! What do people usually do during Lunar New Year?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We, um, spend time with family. And we eat many food, like... dumplings and fish. Also, we give red envelope. It is... how to say... money gift.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, red envelopes! I’ve heard of those. Do you also decorate your house?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! We put up red things, like paper with lucky words. And we clean house before New Year. It means... um, make everything new.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Do you have any special traditions you like the most?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like... um, setting off fireworks. It is very fun and loud. Also, I enjoy... um, visiting temple to pray for good luck.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! Do you usually visit your relatives during this time?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I visit my grandparents and, um, cousins. We eat together and talk. It is... very warm feeling.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s lovely! It sounds like a really meaningful holiday.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is. I always happy to celebrate it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I can see why you love it so much. Thanks for sharing, Mei!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You are welcome! Do you have favorite holiday too?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d say Christmas is my favorite. It’s a time for family and gifts, just like Lunar New Year.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I see. It sounds nice. Maybe one day I can celebrate Christmas too.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great! You’d love it. Well, thanks again for sharing about Lunar New Year.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you for listening! It was nice to talk.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Mei. Let’s chat again soon!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, let’s talk again. Have a good day!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Mei! Take care.  

**Both:** Goodbye!
