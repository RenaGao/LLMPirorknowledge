**Conversation: Asking a Teacher for Clarification on an Assignment**

---

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Mei! Do you have a moment?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, teacher. I have some question about the... um, assignment.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Which part do you need help with?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** The part about... how to say... the presentation? I don’t understand what you mean by "visual aids."  

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, visual aids are things like pictures, charts, or graphs that help explain your ideas during the presentation. Does that make sense?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I see! Like, um, PowerPoint with picture?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! A PowerPoint slide with pictures or diagrams would be a great visual aid.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, okay. But how many... um, how many slides I need?  

**Speaker A (NS):** You should aim for about 5 to 7 slides. Keep them simple and clear.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, 5 to 7 slides. And the time... um, how long I speak?  

**Speaker A (NS):** You should speak for about 5 minutes. Make sure to practice so you don’t go over time.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, 5 minutes. I will practice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any other questions?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um... no, I think it’s clear now. Thank you, teacher.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Mei. Let me know if you need more help. Good luck with your presentation!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, teacher. I will try my best. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Mei! You’ll do great.
