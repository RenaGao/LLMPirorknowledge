 

**Native Speaker (NS):** Hey, Mei! Do you have any plans for the weekend?  
**Second-Language Learner (L2):** Oh, hi! Yes, I have plan. I think to go shopping with my friend Wing.  

**NS:** That sounds fun! What are you planning to buy?  
**L2:** Um, maybe some clothes and... how to say... things for home? Like, for kitchen.  

**NS:** Oh, household items, you mean?  
**L2:** Yes, yes, household items. And also maybe... um, we eat lunch together.  

**NS:** Nice! Where are you thinking of eating?  
**L2:** There is a restaurant near mall. We go there before. Food is good, and not too expensive.  

**NS:** Great choice. Are you going anywhere else after that?  
**L2:** Maybe... um, if time is enough, we go to park. Wing like to walk and take photos.  

**NS:** That’s lovely! Sounds like a relaxing day. What time are you meeting?  
**L2:** We meet at ten o’clock. Early is better, because later too many people.  

**NS:** Agreed, mornings are quieter. Do you need a ride or anything?  
**L2:** No, thank you. We take bus together. It is easy.  

**NS:** That works! Do you have anything planned for Sunday too?  
**L2:** Sunday... um, I think I stay home. Maybe watch movie or... um, do some cleaning.  

**NS:** A quiet day at home sounds nice. What kind of movie are you thinking of watching?  
**L2:** I like comedy. Maybe I watch new one from... um, America.  

**NS:** That’s a good idea. I hope you enjoy it!  
**L2:** Yes, thank you! And I hope your weekend is good too.  

**NS:** Thanks, Mei! I’m sure it will be. Let’s catch up next week and hear how it went.  
**L2:** Yes, we talk next week. Have a good weekend!  

**NS:** You too, bye!  
**L2:** Bye!
