**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thanks for joining me to plan the team meeting. Can we start by deciding the topics for the agenda?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! Um, I think first we need to... uh, talk about the project progress. Is it correct?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s a good idea. We should discuss how the project is going. Anything else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe we can, um, talk about the problem. Like, the... the thing that make the work slow.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You mean the challenges or obstacles?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! Challenges. Also, I think we need to... um, plan the next step. Like, future work.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great, so far we have three items: project progress, challenges, and next steps. Does that sound good?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, but... um, maybe we can add one more? Like, team... team activity? For, uh, make everyone happy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, a team-building activity? That’s a nice addition!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, team-building. I think it is important for make team... um, work better together.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. Let’s add that to the agenda. So, the agenda is: project progress, challenges, next steps, and a team-building activity.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that sound good. But... um, how much time we have for each?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. Let’s say 15 minutes for project progress, 20 for challenges, 15 for next steps, and 10 for the team activity.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, but maybe... um, challenges need more time? Sometimes it take long to explain.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re right. Let’s make it 25 minutes for challenges and reduce next steps to 10 minutes.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that is better. Also, who will... uh, lead each part?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I can handle project progress and next steps. Would you be comfortable leading the discussion on challenges?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes, I can try. And maybe someone else can, uh, organize team activity?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’ll ask John to take care of that. Does that cover everything?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think so. If we forget something, we can add later, right?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Thanks for your help, this looks like a solid agenda.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you too! I think the meeting will be, um, very useful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. Let’s finalize the details and share the agenda with the team. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too, see you soon!
