**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Mei, I heard you were upset with me yesterday. Can we talk about it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. I feel... um, not happy because you no come to dinner with me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’m really sorry about that. I thought you said we’d meet at 8 p.m., not 7 p.m. Maybe I misunderstood?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, I say 7 p.m., but maybe my English not clear. I think you forget me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No, I didn’t forget you! I just got the time wrong. I’m really sorry if it made you feel that way.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It’s okay... I just feel... um, lonely when you no come.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I completely understand. I’ll double-check the time next time so this doesn’t happen again.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you. Next time, I will also... um, say time more clear.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good. We can make sure we’re on the same page. Do you feel better now?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I feel better. I happy we talk about it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Thanks for being honest with me. Friendship is important, right?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, very important. I... um, don’t want to lose friend because of small thing.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry, we’re good. How about we plan to have dinner again this weekend?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** That sound good! What time will we meet?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s meet at 7 p.m. again. I’ll set an alarm this time so I don’t forget.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, 7 p.m. I will wait for you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’m looking forward to it! Let’s make sure we both have a great time.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think we will. Thank you for talking with me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Thanks for understanding. See you this weekend, Mei.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you then!
