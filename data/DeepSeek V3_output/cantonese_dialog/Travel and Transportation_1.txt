  

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, thank you! I... um, want to go to hotel. Do you know where is it?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Do you know the name of the hotel?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, it is... um, Sunshine Hotel.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the Sunshine Hotel? That’s not too far from here. It’s about a 10-minute walk.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Really? Can you tell me how to go there?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Go straight this way until you reach the traffic light. Then turn right. You’ll see the hotel on your left.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Straight... then right. And it is on... left side?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You’ll see it right there.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, okay. Thank you so much!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Do you need anything else?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I think no. I go to hotel now.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, take care and have a great stay!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! You are very kind. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Safe travels!
