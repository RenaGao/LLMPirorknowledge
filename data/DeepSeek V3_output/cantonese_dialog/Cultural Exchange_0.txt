**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! In Hong Kong, we have... um... Mid-Autumn Festival. It is very important.  

**Speaker A (NS):** The Mid-Autumn Festival? That sounds interesting. What happens during it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We eat mooncake. It is... uh, round cake, very sweet. And we use lanterns, like... um, light up in the night.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, lanterns? Do people carry them around or hang them up?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Both! Children carry lanterns, and some people hang them. Also, we... um... how to say... gather with family. It is time for togetherness.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. Is there a story or meaning behind the festival?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! There is... um... Chang'e. She is moon goddess. The festival is for... um... celebrating the moon, and also for... uh, harvest time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Chang'e and the moon? That’s fascinating. Do you have any special activities for children?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! Children play with... um... fire dragon dance. It is... uh, dragon made with fire and people dance with it. Very exciting!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. Do you celebrate it every year?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, every year. It is... um... important for family and friends. We eat mooncake, watch moon, and enjoy time together.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. I’d love to experience it someday. Thanks for sharing!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You are welcome! If you come to Hong Kong during Mid-Autumn, I can show you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! I’ll definitely keep that in mind.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, you will like it. It is very... um... special time for us.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure it is. Thanks again for explaining it so well!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you for listening. I hope you can come one day.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Take care and see you later!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you later!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Have a great day!
