**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thanks for meeting with me today! Can you tell me about a recent personal achievement?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. Recently, I finish... um, finish my first 10-kilometre run. It was hard, but I do it!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that’s amazing! How did you prepare for it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I run every day, but not so much at first. Slowly, I run more... uh, longer. And I eat healthy food.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great discipline! How did you feel after finishing the race?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I feel very happy! And... um, proud. It is big thing for me because before, I never think I can do it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s such an accomplishment! What did this achievement mean to you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It mean... um, how to say... I can do things if I try hard. Even if it look difficult at first.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a really important lesson. Do you think this will motivate you to try other challenges?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! Now I think maybe I can try... um, half marathon next time. But I need more practice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great goal! I’m sure you’ll do well if you keep up your training.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you. I will try my best!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Is there anything else you’d like to share about this experience?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm... I think it teach me to not give up. Even when body feel tired, I tell myself, ‘Keep going!’  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a fantastic mindset. Thanks for sharing your story—it’s really inspiring!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you for listening. I’m happy to share.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Have a great day, and good luck with your future runs.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, you too! See you next time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care!
