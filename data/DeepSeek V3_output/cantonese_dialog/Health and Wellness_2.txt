**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thanks for coming in today! Can you tell me a bit about your fitness goals?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, thank you. I want to... um, get more strong and healthy. I feel tired, so I need more exercise.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. So, improving strength and energy. Do you currently have any exercise routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, but not... um, how to say, not regular. Sometimes I run, but not every day. Maybe two time a week.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start! Running twice a week is great. Are you interested in trying other exercises too?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I hear weight training is good. But I don’t know how to start. It looks... um, difficult.

**Speaker A (NS):** It can seem tricky at first, but I can guide you. Maybe we can start with simple exercises. How often would you like to work out?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe three or four time a week. But not too hard. I don’t want to feel... um, very tired.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. We’ll keep it manageable. What about diet? Do you think about what you eat?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I try to eat less... um, unhealthy food. I like vegetables and fish, but sometimes I eat too much rice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to hear! You’re already making healthy choices. Would you like help with meal planning or just focus on exercise?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think focus on exercise first. Then later, maybe we can talk about food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! Let’s start with a simple workout schedule. We’ll include running, some weight training, and maybe stretching. Does that sound okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that sound good. Thank you for... um, helping me.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Is there anything else you’d like to add or ask?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um... how long should I do each exercise?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! For now, 30 minutes is enough. We can increase it later if you’re comfortable.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, 30 minutes is... um, not too long. I can do that.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s meet again next week to see how it’s going. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, next week is okay. Thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! See you next week. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too. See you then!
