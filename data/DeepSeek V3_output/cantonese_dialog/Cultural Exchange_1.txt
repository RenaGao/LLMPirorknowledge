**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Wing! I thought it’d be fun to talk about dining customs. Do you think there are big differences between Western and Cantonese dining etiquette?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! I think have many different. For example, in Hong Kong, we share food. Everyone take from one dish. Is very common.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting! In Western cultures, we usually have our own plates. But sharing sounds nice—it feels more communal.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, communal. And... um, when we eat, we use chopsticks. If you use chopsticks wrong way, people maybe... um, think you not polite.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Do you have any tips for using chopsticks politely?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. Don’t put chopsticks straight in rice. It look like... um, how to say... funeral thing. Also, don’t use chopsticks to point at people.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to know! I’ll remember that. What about seating arrangements? Are there any rules?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, usually the oldest sit first. And... um, the most important person sit in the best chair, like facing door.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fascinating. In Western culture, we don’t usually have such formal seating rules, but it’s polite to wait for everyone to sit before eating.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, yes. Also, in Hong Kong, we don’t start eating until host say, “Let’s eat.” It is... uh, polite.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. In the West, we usually wait for everyone to get their food before starting.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, similar but different. Oh, and in Hong Kong, we don’t leave rice in bowl. It mean... um, you not thankful for food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good habit! In the West, it’s polite to finish your food, but it’s not as strict. This has been really interesting. Thanks for sharing!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you also! I learn about Western way too. Maybe next time we can try each other’s food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! I’d love to.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, see you next time!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you, Wing! Have a great day!
