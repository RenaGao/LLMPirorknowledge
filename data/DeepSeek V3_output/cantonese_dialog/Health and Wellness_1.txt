 

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sam! You look a bit tired. Are you feeling okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, I feel a little bit... um, not so good. I work many late night.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s not healthy! You should try to get more sleep.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I know, but I need finish work. My boss... uh, give me many task.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand, but you still need to take care of yourself. Maybe try to set a bedtime routine.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bedtime routine? What is... how to say... how to do it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Like going to bed at the same time every night, avoiding screens an hour before bed, and maybe doing something relaxing like reading.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I see. I try but always... uh, my phone too exciting.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I get that. But maybe put your phone aside and read a book instead. It’ll help you sleep better.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think I try this. Also, I feel very... um, how to say... no energy?  
**Speaker A (NS):** You mean you feel tired all the time?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, tired all time. Maybe because I eat... uh, quick-food only.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Fast food isn’t good for you. You should try to eat more fruits, vegetables, and healthy meals.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I try, but I don’t know... uh, how to cook.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You don’t have to cook complicated meals. Start with simple things like salads, boiled eggs, or even steamed vegetables.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, that sound... um, not so hard. I try it. Thank you for advice.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Also, don’t forget to exercise. Even a short walk every day can make a big difference.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will start walk in the park. Maybe... uh, 20 minutes?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect! Start small and build up. You’ll feel much better soon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you very much. I feel more... um, hopeful now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let me know how it goes. Take care, Sam!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I will. Goodbye and thank you again!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Sam! Take care of yourself.
