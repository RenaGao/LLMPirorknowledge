**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Mei! It’s great to see you. Can you tell me about a tradition or festival from your culture?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! I talk about Mid-Autumn Festival. It very important in Hong Kong.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! What happens during the festival?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We eat mooncake, um, round cake with sweet thing inside. And also... we light lantern, like colorful light.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Mooncakes and lanterns—that sounds fun! Why is the festival celebrated?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It is about family together. We sit and watch moon, very big and round. Also, old story about... um... lady fly to moon.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s beautiful. I’ve heard the story of Chang’e. It’s nice that it’s about family and the moon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! Family is very important in our culture. Also, we give mooncake to friends, like gift.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a lovely tradition. Do you have a favorite type of mooncake?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like lotus seed one, with egg yolk inside. It is salty and sweet, very delicious.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds unique! I’d love to try it someday. Do you celebrate it with your whole family?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we meet at my grandma house. We eat together, talk, and children play with lantern.
