**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m interested in this necklace. How much is it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, hello! This necklace is... um, 50 dollar. It is made from silver.  
**Speaker A (NS):** $50? Hmm, that’s a bit more than I was expecting. Could you do $35?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** $35? Um... I think, maybe... $40? Is better for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** $40 sounds fair. What else can you tell me about it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It is... um, handmake by local artist. Very unique! And the design is... inspired by the mountain.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s beautiful! I do love the design. Is $40 your final price?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, $40 is lowest. For you, I give good price because you like it so much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I’ll take it at $40. Do you take credit cards?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, sorry, only cash. But there is ATM near here.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, I’ll go get some cash. Can you hold it for me?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Of course! I keep it for you. Come back anytime.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thank you! I’ll be back in a few minutes.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, see you soon! Take your time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Here’s the cash—$40 exactly. Thank you again!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I hope you enjoy the necklace. Have a nice day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Bye!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bye! See you next time.
