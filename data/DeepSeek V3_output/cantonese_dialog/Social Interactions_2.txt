 

**Speaker A (NS):**  Hi, Auntie May! It’s been a while. How have you been?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**  Oh, hello! I am good, good. How about you? It’s really been long time!  
**Speaker A (NS):**  I’m doing well, thanks. I’ve been busy with work, but it’s going okay. How’s Uncle John?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**  Uncle John is... um, he is good too. Sometimes his back pain, but now better.  
**Speaker A (NS):**  That’s good to hear. Is he still working at the school?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**  Yes, yes, he still teaching math. But he say maybe retire next year.  
**Speaker A (NS):**  Oh, really? That’s a big change. Has he thought about what he’ll do after?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**  Um, he say he want to travel. Maybe go Japan or Korea. He like food there!  
**Speaker A (NS):**  That sounds like a great plan! I’m sure he’ll enjoy it. How about you? Any plans for the holidays?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**  Ah, yes! I plan to visit my sister in Toronto. Maybe stay two week. I very miss her!  
**Speaker A (NS):**  That’s wonderful! I’m sure she’ll be happy to see you. When are you leaving?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**  I think... um, next month. After Christmas. How about you?  
**Speaker A (NS):**  I’m staying here this year. Just having a quiet time with family.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**  Oh, that is nice too. Family time is very important.  
**Speaker A (NS):**  Definitely. It’s always good to spend time together.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**  Yes, yes. I agree.  
**Speaker A (NS):**  Well, it’s been great catching up with you, Auntie May. I’ll call again soon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**  Yes, thank you for call. It’s good to talk to you. Take care, okay?  
**Speaker A (NS):**  You too, Auntie May. Say hi to Uncle John for me.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**  I will, I will. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):**  Goodbye! Have a great day!
