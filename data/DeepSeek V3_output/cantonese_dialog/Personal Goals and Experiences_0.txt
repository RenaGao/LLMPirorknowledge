**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It’s great to meet you. Can you tell me a bit about your goals for the next year?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, thank you. My goal is to... um, improve my English. I want speak more... how to say... fluently.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great goal! How do you plan to improve your English?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think I will... um, practice every day. Maybe I join English class, and also... um, watch English movie.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Watching movies is a fun way to learn! Do you have a favorite genre?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like action movie. But sometimes, it is hard to understand. They speak too fast.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true. Maybe you can try using subtitles first, and then watch without them later.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, good idea! I will try that. Also, I plan to read English book. Maybe... um, children book first?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Starting with children’s books is a smart move. They’re simpler and easier to follow.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think so. And I want to... um, find English friend to practice talking.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! Having a conversation partner can really help.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I hope so. But sometimes I feel shy because of my... uh, grammar mistake.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry about mistakes. Everyone makes them when learning a new language. The important thing is to keep practicing.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, that make me feel better. I will try not to be shy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! It’s all about progress, not perfection.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I understand. Progress is important.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! So, to summarize, your goals are to improve your English through movies, books, and finding a conversation partner?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that’s right. And I will practice every day.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a solid plan. I’m sure you’ll do great.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you for your advice. It is very helpful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Good luck with your goals, and I’m sure we’ll talk again soon.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, thank you! See you next time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, and see you later!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Goodbye!
