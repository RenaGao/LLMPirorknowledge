**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei! How are you doing today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi! I’m fine, thank you. How about you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good, thanks! I was wondering, do you have any favorite movies or TV shows?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! I like to watch… um, how to say… “love story” movie. Like “Titanic.” Very touching.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, romantic movies? I love those too! “Titanic” is a classic. Do you have other favorites?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I also like “The Notebook.” The story is… um, very sad but beautiful. You know it?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I’ve seen it! It’s really emotional. What about TV shows? Do you watch any?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** TV show… um, I like “Friends.” It is funny and make me happy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** “Friends” is so great! I love the humor and the characters. Do you have a favorite character?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like Phoebe. She is… um, very funny and different.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, Phoebe is so unique! Have you watched any other comedy shows?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I try “The Big Bang Theory.” It is good but… sometimes the joke is too fast, I cannot understand.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I get that. The jokes can be tricky. Maybe subtitles can help?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I use subtitles. It helps a lot.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s smart. By the way, do you like action movies?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Action movie… I watch sometimes, like “Mission Impossible.” It is exciting but… I prefer love story.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fair. Romantic movies are great for relaxing. Do you watch dramas too?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like Korean drama. The story is… um, very detailed and emotional.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Korean dramas are amazing! They really draw you in. Well, it’s been great talking about movies and shows with you, Mei.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I enjoy talking with you. Let’s talk again soon!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Have a great day, Mei.
