**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry, everyone feels that way at first. Let me show you how to use the task management system.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, please. I not familiar with this system. Is it... um, difficult to learn?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Not at all. I’ll walk you through it step by step. First, you log in here with your email and password.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I understand. Log in with email and password. After that, what should I do?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Once you’re in, you’ll see a list of projects. Click on the one assigned to you, and it will show your tasks.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I see. So I click project, then see task. How to... um... how to mark task as finish?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! Just click the checkbox next to the task, and it will mark it as complete.
