 

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Emily! I’ve been meaning to talk to you about something. Can we chat for a moment?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, of course. What is the matter?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I heard from someone that you were upset with me because I didn’t invite you to the party last weekend. Is that true?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh… um, actually, I feel a bit sad about it. I thought you don’t want me to come.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, that wasn’t my intention at all! I thought you were busy that weekend, so I didn’t want to bother you.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Really? I was not busy. But I think… maybe we have misunderstanding.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it seems like we did. I’m really sorry if I made you feel left out. I didn’t mean to.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It’s okay. I also sorry if I think wrong. Maybe next time we can… um, how to say… talk more clearly?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Communication is key. I’ll make sure to check with you directly next time.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that is good idea. I feel better now. Thank you for explain.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I’m glad we cleared this up. Friends?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, friends! And next time, I will also… um, ask you if I have question.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. That sounds great. Thanks for being so understanding, Emily.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you too. I feel happy we talk today.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Let’s catch up soon, okay?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay! See you later, then.  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Take care!
