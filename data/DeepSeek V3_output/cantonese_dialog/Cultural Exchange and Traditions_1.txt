**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How are you doing today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I am good, thank you. How about you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks! So, I heard you’ve traveled quite a bit. Have you noticed any differences in dining etiquette in other countries?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes! In Hong Kong, we have many... um, rules for eating. For example, we always use chopsticks, and it’s not polite to... how to say... stick them in the rice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, sticking chopsticks in the rice is considered rude?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes. It looks like... um, funeral thing. Very bad.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I see! That’s something I’d never think about. What else is different?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** In Hong Kong, when we eat with others, we share dishes. Everyone take food from same plate. But in America, I notice everyone have their own plate.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true! In the U.S., we usually eat from our own plates. It’s interesting how different cultures handle that.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, and also, in America, it’s okay to eat with hand, like pizza or burger. But in Hong Kong, we always use utensils.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good point. Eating with hands is pretty common here. Do you find one way more comfortable?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm... I think I like both. But eating with hand is... um... more easy sometimes.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree! It’s nice to not worry about utensils. What about drinking? Any differences there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** In Hong Kong, when we drink tea, we tap the table to say thank you. It’s like... um... small gesture.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s fascinating! I’ve never heard of that.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it’s very polite. In America, I don’t see this. People just say “thank you.”  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true—we usually just say it. It’s cool to learn about these little differences.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think it’s interesting. Every culture have their own way.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. Thanks for sharing all this! I’ve learned a lot.  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You’re welcome! I also enjoy talking about it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Well, it was nice chatting with you. Have a wonderful day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, you too. Bye-bye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Take care!
