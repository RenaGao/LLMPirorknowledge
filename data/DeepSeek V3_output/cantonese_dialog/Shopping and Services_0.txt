**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you looking for something specific today?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello! Yes, I need... um, thing for cooking. But I not sure which one is good.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Are you looking for a pan, a knife, or something else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, pan! I need pan for fry... fried rice. My old pan is, uh, broken now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. For fried rice, a non-stick pan would work well. Let me show you some options.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Non-stick... yes, I think that is good. But, um, how to know which one is better?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! This one here has a thicker base, so it heats more evenly. It’s also durable.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I see. And the price... is it expensive?  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s $40, but it comes with a 5-year warranty. It’s a good investment for cooking.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Warranty? Ah, like... if it broken, you fix it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! If there’s any issue, we’ll replace it for free within 5 years.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** That sounds good. Um, I think I will take this one.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! Let me ring that up for you. Would you like a receipt?  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, please. And um... thank you for help me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I’m sure your fried rice will taste even better with this pan.  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I hope so! Thank you again. Have a good day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Enjoy your new pan. Goodbye!  
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Goodbye! See you next time.
