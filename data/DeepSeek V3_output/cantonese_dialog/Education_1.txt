 Okay, here’s the conversation:

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, I heard you’re having trouble with the calculus assignment. Do you want to go over it together?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, thank you! I... um, I don’t understand the differentiation part. It’s very confusing.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries. Let’s start with the basics. Do you know what differentiation is?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think it is... um, find the slope of a curve? But the formula is very hard for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right! The formula can look scary at first, but once you practice, it gets easier. Let’s try an example: what’s the derivative of x²?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um... I think it is 2x? But I don’t know why.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good! It is 2x. The reason is that the derivative measures how fast the function grows. For every tiny change in x, x² grows by 2x. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I think so. So, it’s like... um, the speed of the function?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You’ve got it. Now, let’s try another one. What’s the derivative of 3x³?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Wait, I’m not sure... is it... um, 9x²?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s correct! How did you get that?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think... you multiply the 3 by the power, then minus one from the power?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! You’re doing great. That’s the power rule for derivatives. Let’s try one more: what’s the derivative of 4x⁴?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, it’s... 16x³?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly right! You’ve got the hang of it now.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! Now I feel more... um, confident. But I still need more practice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Practice makes perfect. Do you want me to send you some extra problems to work on?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that would be very helpful! Thank you so much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Let me know if you have any more questions. I’m here to help!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, thank you! I will practice and let you know if I get stuck.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Good luck, Mei!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! See you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later! Keep up the good work.
