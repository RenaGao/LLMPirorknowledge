**[Scene: Two friends, Alex (NS) and Mei (L2, Cantonese), are planning a trip with friends to a new city.]**

**Alex (NS):** Hi, Mei! I heard you’re planning a trip with friends. Where are you thinking of going?  
**Mei (L2):** Ah, yes! We want go to... um, how to say... San Francisco. That one, is it right?  
**Alex (NS):** Yes, San Francisco! That’s a great choice. What do you want to do there?  
**Mei (L2):** We think maybe... see Golden Gate Bridge, and um, eat good food. Also, walk to the... uh, how to say... the sea place.  
**Alex (NS):** Oh, Fisherman’s Wharf?  
**Mei (L2):** Yes, yes! Fisherman’s Wharf. I hear it is very famous.  
**Alex (NS):** It is! You’ll love it. How many people are going on the trip?  
**Mei (L2):** We are... um, five people. My friends from school.  
**Alex (NS):** That’s nice. Do you have accommodation sorted yet?  
**Mei (L2):** Not yet. We think maybe stay in... what is it called... hotel? Or maybe rent house.  
**Alex (NS):** Renting a house could be more fun with a group. Have you checked Airbnb?  
**Mei (L2):** Ah, yes, Airbnb! My friend say it is good. But I worry... uh, how to say... it is too much money.  
**Alex (NS):** I see. Maybe you can look for places a bit outside the city center. It’s usually cheaper.  
**Mei (L2):** That is good idea. I will tell my friends. Thank you!  
**Alex (NS):** No problem. What about transport? Are you driving or taking public transport?  
**Mei (L2):** We think rent car, but... um, Alex, is it easy to drive there? I hear very busy.  
**Alex (NS):** It can be busy, especially downtown. Public transport is pretty good in San Francisco.  
**Mei (L2):** Okay, maybe we use bus or... um, train. Is it safe?  
**Alex (NS):** Yes, it’s safe. Just keep an eye on your belongings, like in any big city.  
**Mei (L2):** I see. Thank you for help, Alex. You make me feel more relax.  
**Alex (NS):** You’re welcome! Let me know if you need more advice. When are you going?  
**Mei (L2):** Next month, um... 15th to 18th.  
**Alex (NS):** Great! I’m sure you’ll have an amazing time.  
**Mei (L2):** Yes, I think so! Thank you again, Alex. You are very helpful.  
**Alex (NS):** No problem at all. Have fun and take lots of pictures!  
**Mei (L2):** I will! Goodbye, Alex. See you later!  
**Alex (NS):** Goodbye, Mei! Enjoy your trip!
