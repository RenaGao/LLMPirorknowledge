**Speaker A (NS):** Good morning, Mei! How’s it going with the project tasks?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Good morning, um... it’s okay. I finish some part, but still have some... uh, how to say... not done yet.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fine. Which parts are still pending?  

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I need to do the... um... thing for checking the data. And also prepare the... uh... report?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! Data validation and report.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. When do you think you can finish these?
