**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! Do you have a moment to talk about the assignment?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, teacher. Thank you for time. I have, um... question about it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What part are you unsure about?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** The part... about the presentation. It says "5-minute talk," but I don’t know... um, how to, uh, make it properly.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, no problem. You need to prepare a 5-minute speech about the topic I gave you. Do you have your topic already?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it is... "climate change." But I worry... um, how to say... I don’t think my English is good for long talk.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry about your English, Jisoo. Focus on your ideas first. You can practice a few times to feel more confident.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, practice... yes. But, um... how many points I should say?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! Start with an introduction, then explain 2 or 3 main points, and finish with a conclusion. That should fit into 5 minutes.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I see. So, first... say what is climate change, then... um, problems, and... how to fix it?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! That’s a great structure. You’re doing well, Jisoo.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, teacher. But... um, how long is 5 minutes?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, it’s about the length of one pop song. If you practice at home with a timer, you’ll get a feel for it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, like a song... that’s easier. I will try it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let me know if you need more help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you so much, teacher. I will, um... practice hard.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Jisoo. I’m sure you’ll do well. Goodbye for now!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Goodbye, teacher. See you in class!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then, and good luck with your preparation!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, teacher. I will do my best!  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you will. Take care!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Take care too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Jisoo! Remember, I’m here if you need help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, teacher. Thank you again. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!  

(The conversation ends with both speakers bidding farewell and agreeing to meet again in class.)
