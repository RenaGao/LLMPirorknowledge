**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo, I heard you’re organizing a cultural event. What’s it about?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! I want share Korean... um, traditions with friends. Like food, clothes, and maybe music.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! What kind of food are you planning to have?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think... bibimbap and kimchi. Very famous in Korea. And maybe tteokbokki? It is... spicy rice cake.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of bibimbap and kimchi. People love them! Will you cook all of this yourself?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe I cook some, but also... um, how to say... ask friends to help. It is lot of work.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. What about the clothes? Are you planning a fashion show?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! Maybe show hanbok. It is traditional dress. Very beautiful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! And what about music? Are you including K-pop?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Of course! K-pop is very popular. Maybe play BTS or Blackpink song.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! When is this event happening?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think... next month. I need time to prepare.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Where will it be held?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe in community center. It is big and have many space.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. Do you need help with anything?
