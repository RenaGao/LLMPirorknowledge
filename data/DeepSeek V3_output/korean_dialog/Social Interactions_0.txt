**Speaker A (NS):** It’s great to meet you, Minji. Are you from around here?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I’m from Korea. I come here to study... um, master’s degree.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s interesting! What are you studying?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I study... um, international business. I like it very much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** International business? That sounds exciting. What do you enjoy most about it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like... um, learning about different culture and... how to say... business strategy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome. It must be challenging but rewarding. How long have you been here?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I stay here... um, two year now. Time goes so fast.  
**Speaker A (NS):** It really does. Do you miss Korea?

**Speaker A (NS):** I bet. Korean food is amazing. Have you found any good Korean restaurants here?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great. I’ll have to try it sometime. So, what do you like to do in your free time?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like to... um, watch movie and go to park. Sometimes I ride bicycle.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun. Do you have a favorite movie?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like... um, “Parasite.” It is... very famous movie in Korea.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of it! It’s really good. So, Minji, it was great talking to you.
