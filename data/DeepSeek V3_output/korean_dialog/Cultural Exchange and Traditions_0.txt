**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jisoo! I’ve been curious—can you tell me about a tradition or festival from Korea?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, of course! Um, in Korea, we have... Chuseok. It is... like, how to say... big holiday for family.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Chuseok! I think I’ve heard of it. Is it kind of like Thanksgiving?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, similar! We eat food, um, many food. And we... we visit family house.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice. What kind of food do you eat during Chuseok?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, we eat songpyeon. It is... like rice cake, but small and sweet. Inside, it have... sesame or honey.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that sounds delicious. Do you make it together as a family?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we make together. It is... very fun. But sometimes, uh, my songpyeon is... not pretty.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I’m sure it still tastes good! Is there anything else you do during Chuseok?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we do... ancestral ritual. We make table with food and bow to ancestors. It is to show... respect.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really meaningful. It sounds like a very special time.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it is. And also, we wear... hanbok. It is traditional Korean clothes. Very colorful and beautiful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve seen pictures of hanbok—they’re stunning! Do you wear it often, or just for Chuseok?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, usually for special day, like Chuseok or... wedding. But now, some people wear it for fun too.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s cool. I’d love to try wearing one someday.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, you should! It is very... elegant.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks for telling me about Chuseok, Jisoo. It sounds like a wonderful tradition.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You’re welcome! Maybe you can come Korea during Chuseok. I will give you songpyeon!  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! I’ll definitely take you up on that offer someday.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I hope so! See you next time, and maybe we can cook together.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Take care, Jisoo!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Goodbye!
