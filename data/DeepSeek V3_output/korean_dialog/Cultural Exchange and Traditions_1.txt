**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Jihye! It’s nice to meet you. I heard you’re from Korea. Can you tell me about dining etiquette there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! In Korea, eating is... um, very important culture. We have many rules. For example, we cannot... uh, how to say... hold rice bowl with hand.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean you shouldn’t lift the bowl while eating?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes! It is... um, not polite. Also, we must wait for oldest person to start eating first.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting! It shows respect for elders, right?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, respect is very important. And... um, we should not... uh, make sound with chopsticks.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, like tapping them on the table?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, and also... um, we cannot stick chopsticks in rice. It look like... how to say... funeral ceremony.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. That makes sense. What about receiving food? Any customs there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! When someone give you food or drink, you must... uh, use both hands. It show respect.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice! In my culture, we usually say “thank you” but don’t always use both hands.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, really? In Korea, not saying thank you is... um, very rude. We always say “kamsahamnida.” And also, we must finish all food in bowl.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good habit! What happens if you leave food?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It mean... um, host is not good cook. Or you are... how to say... not thankful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really different from my culture. Here, leaving a little food sometimes means you’re full.  

**Speaker B (K2, Korean):** Ah, I see. Very different! In Korea, we always try to finish.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks for sharing, Jihye! It’s fascinating to learn about these differences.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, me too! I learn many things about your culture. Thank you for talking with me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let’s catch up again sometime. Goodbye!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, goodbye! See you next time!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Jihye!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Have a nice day!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Have a great day as well! Let’s stay in touch.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will message you later. Thank you for conversation.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re very welcome. It was a pleasure talking with you!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It was pleasure for me too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Take care!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Bye! See you soon!
