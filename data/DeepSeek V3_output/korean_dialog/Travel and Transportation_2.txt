**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! I was thinking we should plan a group vacation. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes, we should go! Maybe... um, to Jeju Island? It is very beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Jeju Island sounds great. What activities can we do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We can climb Hallasan mountain. Also, Jeju have... um, how to say... caves? And many beaches.

**Speaker A (NS):** Caves and beaches, that’s perfect. Do you think it’s easy to get around the island?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we can rent car. Or, um, take bus. Bus is... cheap, but car is more easy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Renting a car might be better if we’re traveling as a group. How many days should we stay?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe four day? Not too short, not too long.

**Speaker A (NS):** Four days sounds good. What about accommodation? Any recommendations?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We can stay in... um, pension? It is like small house. Very comfortable and cheap.

**Speaker A (NS):** A pension sounds cozy. Should we book it in advance?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, better to book early. Jeju is... um, popular for tourist.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. What’s the best time to visit Jeju?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Spring or autumn. Weather is... um, nice. Not too hot, not too cold.

**Speaker A (NS):** Spring sounds lovely. Should we plan for April?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, April is good. Flowers are... um, blooming. Very pretty.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s share this plan with the group and get their feedback.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will tell them. Thank you for... um, planning with me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! It’s going to be a great trip. Let’s talk again soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you later. Bye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Jisoo! Have a great day.
