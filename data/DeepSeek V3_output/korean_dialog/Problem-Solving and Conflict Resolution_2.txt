**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yeonju. Thanks for meeting with me. I want to discuss how we can address the issue with the new project deadlines. Do you have any ideas?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Thank you for talking with me. I think the deadlines... um, they are too... too fast. We need more time, I think.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree, the deadlines are tight. What do you think we should do to manage this?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe... we can ask manager for... uh, how to say... more time? Or divide work between us?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good suggestion. We could split the tasks evenly. Do you think we should prioritize certain parts of the project first?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, prioritize is good. I think... um, first we finish important thing, then the other.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Makes sense. Let’s focus on the high-priority tasks first. Should we create a schedule to track our progress?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, schedule is good. I can make... um, list with all task and time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll help with that too. If we encounter any problems, should we meet weekly to discuss?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Weekly meeting is good. We can talk about problem and... um, find solution together.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Let’s plan to meet every Monday morning. Does that work for you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, Monday morning is okay for me. Thank you for... um, making this plan with me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, teamwork is key. Let’s start by talking to our manager tomorrow about extending the deadlines.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I agree. Tomorrow we talk to manager.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Thank you for your input, Yeonju. I think this will help us manage the project better.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, too. I feel more... um, confident now. Let’s do our best!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. We’ve got this. Have a great day, Yeonju!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! See you tomorrow.  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then. Let’s make this project a success!
