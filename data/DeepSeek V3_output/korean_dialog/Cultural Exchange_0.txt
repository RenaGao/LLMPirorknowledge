**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I’m really curious about Korean culture. Can you tell me about a tradition or festival from Korea?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! In Korea, we have Chuseok. It is very important holiday. Family... um, gather together and eat food.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice! What kind of food do you eat during Chuseok?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We eat songpyeon. It is rice cake, um... small and half-moon shape. Inside, there is sweet thing like sesame or honey.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds delicious! What else do people do during Chuseok?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We give... ah, how to say... gift to family. Like fruit or meat. And we also do... um, bowing to ancestor. It is called “charye.”  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bowing to ancestors? That’s interesting. Can you explain more about that?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes. We prepare table with food and bow to show respect. We thank them for... um, making our life now.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a beautiful tradition. Do people wear special clothes for Chuseok?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sometimes, we wear Hanbok. It is traditional Korean clothes. Very colorful and pretty.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve seen pictures of Hanbok—they’re gorgeous! Is Chuseok similar to other holidays, like Thanksgiving?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, similar! But Chuseok is more about family and ancestor. And, um, we don’t eat turkey (*laughs*).  

**Speaker A (NS):** *laughs* I see! Can anyone participate in Chuseok, even if they’re not Korean?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Of course! Many people welcome to join. It is fun and... um, meaningful. You can try songpyeon too!  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! I’d love to experience it someday. Thank you so much for explaining.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You are welcome! If you come to Korea during Chuseok, I will show you everything!  

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great! I’ll definitely let you know if I visit.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay! Thank you for listening. I hope you enjoy learning about Chuseok.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I did! It was really interesting. Have a great day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! See you next time!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, and I’ll see you later!
