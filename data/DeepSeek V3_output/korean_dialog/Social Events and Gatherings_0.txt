**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I don’t think we’ve met. I’m Sarah.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, hello Sarah! Nice to meet you. My name is Jisoo.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you too, Jisoo. Is this your first time here?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, first time. I came with my friend... uh, Minji. She introduce me to this place.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! How do you like it so far?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is very... um, interesting? Many people and good music. I like it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that. Where are you from, Jisoo?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I from Korea. Seoul. You know Seoul?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, of course! I’ve never been, but I’d love to visit someday. What’s it like living there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, Seoul is very busy. Many people, many food... um, delicious food. And very modern city.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing. What do you do there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I work in... um, company. I do marketing.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, marketing! That’s cool. Do you enjoy it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like it. But sometimes very busy, haha.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine. It’s nice to have a job you enjoy though. How long have you been in this city?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I come here two month ago. Still learning English, so sometimes difficult.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re doing great! It’s not easy to learn a new language.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I try my best.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s all anyone can ask for. It was really nice meeting you, Jisoo.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, me too. Thank you for talking with me, Sarah.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Maybe we’ll run into each other again sometime.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I hope so. Have a good day, Sarah.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Jisoo. See you around!
