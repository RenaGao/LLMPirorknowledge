**Speaker A (NS):** Hey! I heard you’re an amazing cook. What’s your favorite meal to make?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! My favorite is... um... Korean dish. It called 비빔밥. How to say in English... mix rice?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, bibimbap! I’ve heard of it. Sounds delicious. How do you make it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** First, you need rice. It is... main thing. Then, many vegetables. Um... spinach, carrot, and... what is this? 오이?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Cucumber?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, cucumber! And also, meat. Beef is best. You cook meat with soy sauce... and sesame oil. It make very tasty.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great. Do you add anything else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes! Red pepper paste... 고추장. It is spicy, but very good. And egg. You fry egg and put on top.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that’s a lot of steps. Do you cook it often?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I make it... um, every week. It is easy and healthy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to try it sometime. Would you teach me how to make it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Of course! We can cook together. I show you... step by step.
