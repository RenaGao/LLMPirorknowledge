**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! How’s your morning routine been lately?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello! My morning routine... um, I wake up at 7 o’clock. Then, I brush my teeth and wash my face. Simple, I think.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good! Do you have breakfast after that?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, but sometimes... um, how to say... I skip breakfast? Because I late, you know?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. But it’s important to eat breakfast! What do you usually eat when you have time?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm, I like eat rice and... um, something with soup? Like Korean soup. It is good for morning.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! I usually have toast and coffee. Do you drink coffee in the morning?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Coffee... um, yes, I drink it sometimes. But not every day. It make me too awake, I think.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Ha, I get that. What about exercise? Do you do anything in the morning?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, exercise... um, I try to walk few minute outside. Fresh air is good, I think. But not long, maybe 10 minute.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice way to start the day. Do you listen to music or anything while you walk?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! I listen music. Um, I like K-pop song. It make me happy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great way to boost your mood! Any favorite K-pop artists?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh... I like BTS and... um, Blackpink. Their song is very fun.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice! I’ve heard their songs too. What about after your walk? Do you start work or study?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I start study at 9 o’clock. I am student, so I have many things to do.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s good that you have a consistent routine. I think I should try waking up earlier, too.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Early morning is good! You feel more... um, productive, I think.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true. Thanks for sharing your routine with me, Minji!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You’re welcome! It was nice talking with you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here. Let’s catch up again soon!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, let’s meet again! Have a good day!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Minji. Take care!
