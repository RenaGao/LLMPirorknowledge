**Scene: Negotiating a price for a handmade scarf at a local market.**

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! This scarf looks beautiful. How much is it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, thank you! This one is... um, 40 dollar.  
**Speaker A (NS):** $40? That’s a bit high for me. Could you lower the price?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm... I can lower to 35 dollar. It is good quality. Handmade.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. It is very nice, but I was thinking more like $25. Would that be okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** $25 is too low... I make it by myself. It take many time. Maybe... 30 dollar?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I can do $30. That seems fair.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, thank you! I wrap it for you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great. Do you take credit cards?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... I prefer cash. Is it okay?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I have cash. Here’s $30.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you so much! I hope you like it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure I will. It’s really lovely. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Thank you for buying. Goodbye!
