**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! Are you free to help plan the team meeting this week?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I free. When is the meeting?  

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s on Wednesday at 3 p.m. Can you join?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Wednesday 3 p.m.? Um... I think I can. What we need to decide?  

**Speaker A (NS):** We need to decide the agenda. What topics do you think are important?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... maybe talk about new project and, um... how to say... progress of current work.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Good ideas! Should we also discuss the budget for the next quarter?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Budget is important. Also, maybe we can talk about... team schedule?  

**Speaker A (NS):** A schedule discussion sounds helpful. Who should lead the meeting?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think... um, manager should lead. But maybe someone else can help with... uh, details.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Let’s ask Sarah to help with the details. Should we send the agenda out by Tuesday?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, Tuesday is good. Everyone has time to... um, prepare.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll draft the agenda and send it to you for review before Tuesday.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I will check and, um... give feedback.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Let’s make sure we cover everything so the meeting runs smoothly.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, agree. I think it will be good meeting.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Thanks for your help, Jisoo! Let’s wrap this up for now.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay. See you on Wednesday, and thank you for... um, organizing.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. See you then!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Bye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!  

The conversation ends with a plan for the team meeting and mutual agreement on next steps.
