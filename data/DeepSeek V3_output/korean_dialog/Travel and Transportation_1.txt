**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Do you need help with something?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hello. Yes… um, I want to find hotel. But I don’t know here.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Where are you trying to go? Do you have the hotel name?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, the hotel is… um, Sunshine Hotel. I think it is near.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sunshine Hotel? Yes, it’s not far from here. Do you want to walk or take a bus?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Walk is okay for me. Can you tell me… um, how to go?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! You go straight down this street. At the traffic light, turn left. Then you’ll see the hotel on your right.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Left at traffic light, and then right…?  
**Speaker A (NS):** No, after you turn left, you don’t turn right. The hotel will be on your right side.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I understand. Thank you. How long… um, how much time to walk?  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s about a 10-minute walk, maybe less.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ten minute is not long. Thank you so much!  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Enjoy your stay at the Sunshine Hotel!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you again. Have a nice day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Goodbye!
