**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you have the receipt with you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, here is it. I buy it last week, but it... how to say... broke after one day.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. Let me check the receipt. Hmm, it looks like you’re still within the return period.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** That is good. Can I get... um, money back?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. Would you prefer a refund to your original payment method or store credit?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I want money back... to my card, please.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’ll process that for you. It might take a few days to appear in your account. Is that okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it is okay. Thank you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Just one more thing—did you bring the original packaging and all the accessories?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, everything is... ah, how to say... together. Here you go.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll take care of the return now. Please sign here for the refund.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay. *signs* Thank you for your help.
