**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minji! I heard it’s Hyunwoo’s birthday soon. Do you have any ideas for a surprise?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes! I think we... um, make party at his house? Maybe when he is not there.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good plan. Do you know when he’ll be out?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** His sister say he go... um, go to gym at Saturday afternoon. So we can do then.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. What should we do for decorations?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh... balloons? And also, we can make banner? Like, “Happy Birthday Hyunwoo!”  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! I can bring balloons. What about food?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hyunwoo like... uh, Korean food. Maybe we order kimchi jjigae and samgyeopsal?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds delicious! Where can we order it from?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I know one place. They deliver fast. I will call them before party.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome. Should we get him a gift too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! He always talk about new... um, thing for listening music? Headphones!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Headphones? Nice! We can split the cost.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay! I will buy it online. They have discount now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Do you want to invite anyone else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe his close friends? Like, Jisoo and Minho? They can come too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. I’ll text them. What time should we meet on Saturday?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** How about... 2 PM? We can prepare before he come back.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Let’s confirm everything on Friday.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we can check then. Thank you for help!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! This will be a great surprise. See you on Saturday!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** See you! Bye!
