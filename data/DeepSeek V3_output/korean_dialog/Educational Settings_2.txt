**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minji! I heard you're having trouble with the homework. Can I help?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes, thank you! I... uh, I don’t understand the... um, problem about statistics. It is very difficult.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the statistics problem. Do you mean the one about probability?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, probability. I think... uh, how to calculate? I forget the formula.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! The formula is P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total outcomes. Does that make sense?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, I remember now. But... um, I don’t know how to find favorable outcome. The problem is about... uh, rolling dice.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, got it. So, if you’re rolling two dice, and you want to find the probability of getting a sum of 7, first you have to count all the ways to get 7. Do you know how many combinations make 7?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... one, two... maybe... six?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Close! There are six favorable outcomes: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,1).  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. So, total outcome is... um, 36? Because 6 times 6?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! So the probability is 6/36, which simplifies to 1/6.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I understand now! Thank you so much. You are very helpful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let me know if you need help with anything else.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. And... um, next time, maybe I can help you too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great. Let’s study together again soon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, let’s do it. Thank you again. Have a good day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Minji. See you later!
