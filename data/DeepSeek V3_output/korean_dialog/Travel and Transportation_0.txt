**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, I heard you just got back from a trip! How was it?   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes! I go to Busan last weekend. It was... um, very good experience.   
**Speaker A (NS):** Busan? That’s awesome! I’ve heard it’s a beautiful city. What did you do there?   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I visit Gwangalli Beach and eat a lot of seafood. Also, I go to Gamcheon Culture Village. It was... colorful and many photo spots.   
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! Did you take photos?   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I take many photos! But, um, I forgot bring my good camera, so I use phone. Still, it was nice.   
**Speaker A (NS):** Phone cameras are pretty good these days. How was the weather?   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Weather was... sunny but windy. Perfect for walking around. I like it much.   
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Did you try any local food?   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I eat... uh, hoe? Raw fish dish. And also ssiat hotteok. It is sweet pancake, very famous in Busan.   
**Speaker A (NS):** Raw fish sounds adventurous! Was it good?   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it was fresh and delicious. But, um, first time eating raw fish, so I feel little nervous.   
**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! Anything else you enjoyed?   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I also go to Jagalchi Market. There are many fish and people. Very lively place.   
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you buy anything?   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I buy small ocean things... um, souvenirs? For my family. They like it.   
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s thoughtful of you. So, overall, would you recommend Busan to others?   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes! Busan is very beautiful and have many things to do. Food is also great. I will go again.   
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful to hear. Thanks for sharing your trip with me!   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you for listening! Next time, we go together?   
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a plan. Let’s do it!   
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay! I’m looking forward to it. Goodbye!   
**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, see you soon!
