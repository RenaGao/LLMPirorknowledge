**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Could you tell me about your favorite place to visit?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! My favorite place is Namsan Tower in Seoul. It is... um, how to say... very beautiful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Namsan Tower! I’ve heard of it. What makes it special for you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like the view. From the top, you can see all Seoul. And, um... many people put love locks there.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Love locks? What are those?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is... um, small locks. Couple write their name and put on fence. It means their love... no break.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds romantic! Do you have one there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, no, not yet. But maybe... in future? Haha.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice idea! Do you go there often?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I go there with friends. We take photo and, um... eat street food.  

**Speaker A (NS):** What kind of street food?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah... tteokbokki, hotteok, and... um, how to say... fried thing on stick?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, like skewers?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! Skewers. Very delicious.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing. Is it easy to get to Namsan Tower?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, you can take bus or... um, walk up the mountain. It is good exercise.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to visit someday. Thanks for sharing! You’ve made it sound so special.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! If you come, I can... um, show you around.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great! Thanks for the offer.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You’re welcome. Have a nice day!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Goodbye!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Goodbye! See you later!
