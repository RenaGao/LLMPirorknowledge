**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Soojin! How’s it going? Are you ready for the test next week?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, hello! Um... I am little nervous. I study hard, but... grammar is... how to say... difficult for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I get that. Grammar can be tricky. What parts are you struggling with?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I have problem with... um... present perfect? Like, "I have went" or "I have gone."  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. It’s "I have gone." The past participle is important. How about making a list of irregular verbs?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that is good idea. I will try. Do you have any... um... tips for reading part?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Read the questions first, then skim the text. It saves time. Oh, and highlight key words in the text.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Highlight key words... I see. That sounds helpful. I will do that.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! How about practicing together sometime this week?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes, please! When is good time for you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** How about Wednesday afternoon, around 2 PM?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Wednesday 2 PM is okay. We meet at library?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the library works. I’ll bring some practice tests.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you so much! I feel... um... more confident now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Don’t worry, you’ll do great.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I hope so. Thank you for your help. See you Wednesday!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Bye, Soojin.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Goodbye!
