**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! It’s been a while. How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, um, I’m good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I noticed you’ve been looking a bit tired recently. Are you getting enough sleep?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I think I not sleep enough. Busy with work... and study.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds tough. Sleep is really important for staying healthy. Maybe you should try to go to bed earlier.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I know. But it’s hard to finish work early. How to say... I have many deadline.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Maybe you can set a small goal, like going to bed just 30 minutes earlier. Every little bit helps.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** That is good idea. I will try. But also, um, I feel tired even if I sleep. How to say... like, not good sleep.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that could be stress or maybe your sleep environment isn’t comfortable. Do you have a relaxing bedtime routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Bedtime routine? Ah, no. I just... um, go to bed when tired.

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe you could try something relaxing before bed, like reading a book or listening to calming music. It might help you sleep better.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Reading book is good idea. I like it. I will try. But also, um, exercise is important, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Exercise is a great way to stay healthy and reduce stress. Do you do anything regularly?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No... I want to exercise, but I don’t have time. How to say... work is very busy.

**Speaker A (NS):** I get it. Maybe you could start with something small, like a short walk during lunch or stretching at home. It doesn’t have to be a big workout.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, small start is good. I will try walking. And also, um, eating is important too, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Eating a balanced diet is key. Are you eating regularly, or do you skip meals because of work?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sometimes... I skip meal. Especially breakfast. I’m too busy in morning.

**Speaker A (NS):** Breakfast is really important to start your day. Maybe you can prepare something simple, like fruit or yogurt, the night before.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Preparing is good idea. I will try. Thank you for the advice!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I hope these small changes help. Let’s catch up again soon and see how you’re doing.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. I will try and tell you next time. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Jisoo! Take care!
