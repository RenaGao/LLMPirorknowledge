**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jihoon, I heard you were upset about the canceled trip. I didn’t know you were planning to come with us!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I feel... um, sad? Because I think you don’t want me to join.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, that’s not true at all! I thought you were busy with work, so I didn’t invite you. I’m really sorry for misunderstanding.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. I was busy, but I want to join if possible.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Next time, I’ll check with you first. How about we plan another trip together?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that sounds good. I like to travel with you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s set a date and make sure we’re all on the same page.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay. I will check my schedule and tell you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Thanks for talking this through with me, Jihoon. I’m glad we cleared things up.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. I feel better now. Let’s plan soon!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Take care, and we’ll talk soon!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay. Goodbye, and see you next time!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Jihoon!
