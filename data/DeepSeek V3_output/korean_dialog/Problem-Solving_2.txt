**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jiyoung! Thanks for coming by. How’s it going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hello! I’m fine, thank you. But I have something to say. It is... um, maybe problem.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, no. What’s the matter?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I... I make mistake. I forget to send email to client. Now they are waiting.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. When was the email supposed to be sent?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It should be sent yesterday. I am very sorry for this mistake.  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s okay—mistakes happen. Have you sent it now?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I send email just now. But I worry they will be angry.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I think it’s good you sent it now. Maybe you can explain to them and apologize.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will say sorry. And also... I will offer something to make up. Maybe discount for next order?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. A discount shows you’re serious about making things right.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I hope they understand. I don’t want to lose them as client.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure they’ll appreciate your honesty and effort to fix it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you for advice. I feel a little better now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let me know if you need help drafting the message.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. If you can check my email, I will be very thankful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’d be happy to help. And don’t stress too much—it’ll work out.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I will do my best. Thank you again.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let me know how it goes. Have a good day.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Jiyoung! Take care.  

The conversation ends on a positive note, with both speakers summarizing the solution and expressing polite goodbyes.
