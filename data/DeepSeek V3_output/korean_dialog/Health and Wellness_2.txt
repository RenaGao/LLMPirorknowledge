**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for coming in today. Can you tell me a bit about your current exercise routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you. I... um, I go to gym three time... three times a week. I run on... how to say... machine for running?  

**Speaker A (NS):** The treadmill?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, treadmill! I run for thirty minute. And, um, I do some lifting... lifting thing... weight?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Weightlifting?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, weightlifting. But I not sure do it right.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Do you have any specific fitness goals you’re working toward?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I want... um, to get stronger. And maybe lose little fat. Not much fat, but a little.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great goal! Have you tried any specific diets or nutrition plans?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I try to eat more vegetable. And, um, I cook at home. No... no fast food.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great start. How about protein? Do you make sure to include that in your meals?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I eat chicken and... um, fish. And sometimes egg. But I think maybe not enough.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Protein is important for building muscle. Maybe we can work on a plan to increase that.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, please. I need help for that.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’ll create a simple nutrition guide for you. How about your schedule? Is it consistent?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Schedule is... um, yes, same every week. Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Always same time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Consistency is key. Would you like to add any new exercises to your routine?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe... um, something for core? My... core is weak.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. I’ll show you some core exercises next time.
