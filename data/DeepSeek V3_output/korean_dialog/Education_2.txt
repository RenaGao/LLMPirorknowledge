**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minji! I saw you had a question about the homework. How can I help?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you, teacher. I... um, don’t understand the question number three. What it mean, “analyze the structure”?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, sure! It means you need to look at how the essay is organized. For example, how the writer introduces the topic, develops the ideas, and concludes. Does that make sense?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I see. So, I need to write about... um, how the essay is... built?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You’re explaining how the writer built the essay.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, understand now. Thank you, teacher. But, um... can you check my sentence? I write, “The essay have three part.” Is correct?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Almost! It should be, “The essay *has* three parts.” Remember, “essay” is singular, so we use “has” instead of “have.”  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! “The essay has three parts.” Thank you for correcting me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Do you have any other questions?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, no, I think... that’s all. Thank you very much, teacher.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let me know if you need more help. Good luck with the homework!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. I will do my best. See you next class!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you then, Minji! Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too, teacher. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
