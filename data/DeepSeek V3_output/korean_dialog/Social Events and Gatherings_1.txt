**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! Thanks for coming. I was thinking we could plan a surprise party for Minji this weekend. What do you think?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! That’s good idea. Minji, she... um, like surprise.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any ideas for what we should do?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe we make... um, place with balloon? And, uh, cake. She like cake.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Balloons and cake sound perfect! Where should we have it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... at her house? When she is not there. Or, uh, park?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Her house might be better since it’s more private. We could decorate while she’s out. What time should we do it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm... maybe in afternoon? Like, 3 o’clock?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That works. Who should we invite?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, we can invite... our friends from class. And her cousin, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. Should we get her a gift too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes! Maybe... uh, book? She loves reading.  
**Speaker A (NS):** A book is a great idea. Should we all chip in for it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, chipping is... uh, fair. How much we pay?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s say $10 each. Sound good?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Good. I can ask... other friends to pay too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll handle the decorations and cake. Can you organize the gifts and invites?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will do it. I send message to friends tomorrow.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome. Let’s meet again on Friday to finalize everything.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay! Friday is good. Thank you for planning.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you too, Jisoo! I think Minji will love it. See you Friday!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** See you then! Bye-bye.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
