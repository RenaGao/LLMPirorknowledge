**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, could you tell me about a skill you’d like to learn?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I want to learn photography. It is... um, important for me because I like to travel and capture the, uh, beauty of nature.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! What kind of photography are you interested in? Landscape?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, landscape. Also, um, how to say... street photo? People in city, what they do.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, street photography? That’s really interesting.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, street photography. I think it is... um, good way to show real life.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I agree. Do you have a camera yet?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Not yet. I am saving money to buy one. Maybe... um, next month?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s exciting! What kind of camera are you thinking of?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I want mirrorless camera. It is smaller and, um, easy to carry.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good choice. Have you looked into any photography courses?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I find online course. It is... um, free. I can learn basics there.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Online courses are a good way to start. Do you have any favorite photographers?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I like Steve McCurry. His photo in Afghanistan is very famous.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the "Afghan Girl" photo? That’s iconic. You have good taste!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I hope to take photos like that someday.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you will! It’s a great goal to have.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will work hard. Thank you for listen.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Good luck with your photography journey. Let me know if you need any help.
