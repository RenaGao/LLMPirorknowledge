**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! Do you need help with something?  
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you. I am looking for... um, the big park. Central Park? How to go there?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Central Park! Sure, it’s not far from here. Are you walking, or do you need public transport?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I walk, please. Is it... um, easy to find?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it’s pretty straightforward. Go straight down this street for about two blocks. Then turn left at the traffic light.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Turn left... at the light. Okay, I understand. And after that?  
**Speaker A (NS):** After that, keep walking for another block. You’ll see the park on your right. It’s very big, so you can’t miss it!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, thank you! So, straight, left, and then... right?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You’ve got it. Do you need me to write it down?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, no, it’s okay. I think I can remember. Um, how long is the walking time?  
**Speaker A (NS):** About 10 minutes, depending on your pace.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, 10 minute. That’s good. Thank you so much for your help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Have a great time at the park.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. And... um, goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Enjoy your day!
