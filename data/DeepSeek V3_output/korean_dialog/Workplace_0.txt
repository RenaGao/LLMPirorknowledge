**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Jisoo, do you have a moment? I wanted to check in about the project deadline.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Please, I am here. What is the problem?  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, just making sure we’re on track. The deadline is next Friday—is that still doable for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, next Friday... I think maybe I can finish. But if possible, I need... uh, two more day?  
**Speaker A (NS):** So, Sunday? That’s a bit tight, but if you need it, sure. What’s the main challenge?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** The data analysis part take more time than I think. And also, the... how to say... graph-making? It is hard for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the visualization part? I can help with that if you’d like.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Really? Thank you, thank you! That will be... um, very helpful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. So, let’s plan to meet Wednesday to go over the data. Does that work for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, Wednesday is good. What time... um, what time is best for you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** How about 3 p.m.?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** 3 p.m. is okay. I will prepare data until then.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And if you run into any issues before then, just let me know.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I will. Thank you so much for understand my... um, my situation.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! We’re a team—we’ll figure it out together.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, team is important. I feel better now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good! And don’t worry, you’re doing a great job. Let’s touch base on Wednesday.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay. See you on Wednesday, then. Thank you again!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Have a good day, Jisoo!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Goodbye, and see you soon.
