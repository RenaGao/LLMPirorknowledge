**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! It’s been so long since we talked. How are you doing?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, hello! I am fine, thank you. How about you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good, thanks. I wanted to ask, how’s your family back home?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** My family is… um, they are good too. My younger brother, he study hard for exam now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Your brother is preparing for exams? That must be stressful.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, very stress. He study until late night.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s tough. And how about your parents? Are they doing well?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** My parents, they… uh, they are healthy. My father, he like gardening now. He grow many flower.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! Does he have a favorite flower?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! He like roses. How to say… red and pink roses.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s beautiful. I’m glad they’re doing well. By the way, are you planning to visit Korea soon?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe next year. I save money now… for airplane ticket. It is… expensive.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I understand. Saving for travel can take time.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes. But I miss my family. I want to see them soon.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure they miss you too. Maybe you can plan a special trip.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, special trip. I will plan more careful… carefully.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. Well, it’s been so nice catching up. Let’s talk again soon, okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you for call. It is… nice to talk with you too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Jisoo! I’ll call you again in a few weeks.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay! Take care too. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
