**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Minji, I wanted to talk about something. Did I misunderstand you yesterday when you said you couldn’t make it to the movie?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Um… I think maybe misunderstanding happen. I said, “I cannot go *this* Friday,” but I can go *next* Friday.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see! You meant next Friday, not this Friday?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes! This Friday, I have… um… family dinner. So I cannot go. But next Friday, I am free.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. I must have missed the “next” part. So, next Friday works for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, next Friday is good. Sorry for confusion.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! It’s my fault for not listening carefully. So, same movie, next Friday?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, same movie. What time we meet?  
**Speaker A (NS):** How about 7 p.m.? That way, we can grab dinner before the movie.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, dinner also? Okay, that sounds good. 7 p.m. is okay for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you want to meet at the usual place?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, usual place is good. Um… near the station, right?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, near the station. I’ll see you there at 7 p.m. next Friday.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, thank you for… um… understanding. Sorry again for confusion.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry about it! I’m just glad we figured it out. See you next Friday!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you next Friday! Have a good day.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Minji. Take care!
