**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minji! I heard you’re having some issues with your internet service. What’s going on?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. My internet is... um, not working good. It’s very slow and sometimes... how to say... disconnect.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds frustrating. Have you contacted your service provider?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, not yet. I don’t know how to explain in English well. Maybe they don’t understand me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand that can be hard. But don’t worry, they’re used to helping customers in many languages. You could start by saying, “My internet is slow and keeps disconnecting.”  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, okay. “My internet is slow and... disconnect?”  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, or “My internet keeps disconnecting.” That’s clearer. You should also check your router. Is it turned on and properly connected?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Router? Ah, yes. I check already. It’s on, but cable maybe... not sure.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, maybe the cable is loose. Try unplugging it and plugging it back in firmly.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I will try. If still problem, I will call the company.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. If you call, they might ask for your account number or the model of your router, so have that ready.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Model? Ah, I don’t know. Maybe I should find it first.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it’s usually written on the router itself. If you can’t find it, just tell them it’s a router, and they’ll guide you.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. You are very helpful. I will try your advice.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let me know if you need more help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. Thank you so much!  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Good luck with fixing it!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I will call the company soon.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Take care!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too. Bye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
