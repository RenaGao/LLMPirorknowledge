**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minji! How are you? Do you have any plans for the weekend?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! I have... um, plan with my friend. We go to Han River.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds nice! What are you going to do there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We ride... um, ride bicycle? And eat chicken.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bike riding and eating chicken? That sounds like a perfect combination!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes! Han River is very beautiful now. Weather is, um, very good.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great. Where will you rent the bikes?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Near Han River Park has... um, place for rent bicycle.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. What time are you meeting?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We meet at... um, 11 in morning.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Eleven a.m. is a good time. Not too early, not too late.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think so. My friend also like this time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good. Will you stay there all day?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe... I think we stay until afternoon. Then go home.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a fun day. I hope the weather stays nice for you.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you! I hope too.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, enjoy your weekend, Minji! Let me know how it goes.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you so much! I will tell you about it next week.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Take care, and see you later!  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you later! Have good day!
