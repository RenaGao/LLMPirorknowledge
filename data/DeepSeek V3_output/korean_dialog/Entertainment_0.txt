**Speaker A (NS):** So, what kind of movies do you usually enjoy watching?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I like many kind of movies. But most... um, I enjoy romantic movie. Also, sometimes action.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Romantic movies, huh? Do you have a favorite one?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! I like very much "The Notebook." It is... how to say... make me cry every time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s a classic! I understand why it makes you cry. What about action movies? Any favorites there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm, action movies... I think "Mission Impossible" is exciting. Tom Cruise is... um, he is amazing actor.  
**Speaker A (NS):** He really is! Have you seen the latest one?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I see it last month. The stunts... um, how to say... very, very dangerous. I think impossible to do it!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Right? It’s incredible what they pull off. Do you watch any TV shows too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! I like TV show more than movie sometimes. I watch... um, "Stranger Things" recently. It is very interesting.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, me too! I’m actually waiting for the next season.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard great things about Korean dramas! Do you have one you’d recommend?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think "Crash Landing on You" is very good. It has romance, comedy, and... uh, some sad part too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great mix! I’ll have to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation!
