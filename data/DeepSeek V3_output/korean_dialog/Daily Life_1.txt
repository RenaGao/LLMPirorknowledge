**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Do you have any plans for the weekend?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I plan to go... um... picnic with my family.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice! Where are you thinking of going?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We will go to park. Big park near Han River. Very beautiful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Hangang Park? That’s a great spot for a picnic.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, Hangang Park! We bring food and... um... blanket for sitting?  

**Speaker A (NS):** A picnic blanket? That’s perfect. What kind of food are you bringing?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We make gimbap, fried chicken, and... um... fruit. Also, we will buy drink like soda.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Are you going to do any activities there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we play... how to say... flying paper?  

**Speaker A (NS):** A kite?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, kite! And maybe ride bicycle if we rent.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun. What time are you planning to go?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We will go morning... um, 10 o’clock. Not too hot.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good time. It should be nice and cool.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes. And we can take photos. My wife like to take many photos.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, that’s great. You’ll have good memories from the day.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I think so too.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you have everything prepared for the picnic?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Almost. I need to buy some snacks... and check weather. Oh, you know... um... for if it rains?  

**Speaker A (NS):** A backup plan?  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, backup plan. Maybe go café if raining.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s smart. I hope the weather stays nice for you.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Me too. Thank you for listen.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Have a wonderful time with your family.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! I hope you also have good weekend.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks! Take care and enjoy your picnic.  

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
