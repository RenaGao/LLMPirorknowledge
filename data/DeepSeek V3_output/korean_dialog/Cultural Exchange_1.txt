**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jihyun! I heard you went to New York last week. How was it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, it was very nice! But, um... I feel some surprise about eating culture.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Really? What surprised you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** In Korea, we... how to say... always share food. But in New York, everyone eat alone. It feels... strange for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. So in Korea, people share dishes, right?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes! We order many dish and put in middle. Then everyone eat together. Also, we wait for older person to start first. It is... uh, respect.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting! We don’t do that here, but it sounds nice. Did you notice anything else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. In Korea, we don’t leave food behind. My American friend... he leave half of pizza. It was... um, feeling waste.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I get that. In Korea, is it polite to finish all your food?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, very polite. If you leave food, it means... not enjoy the meal. In Korea, we say “eat well” before start. It is... um, kind of greeting.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s such a nice custom! Here, we just say “enjoy your meal,” but it’s not as common.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. And also, in Korea, we use... um, metal chopsticks. In America, I see only wood chopsticks. It was hard for me at first.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I didn’t know that! Metal chopsticks sound tricky to use. Did you get used to it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, because I use since young. But in New York, I use fork and knife... um, not comfortable for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! It’s cool to learn about these differences. Anything else you noticed?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, one more thing. In Korea, we don’t give tip. But in America, we must give tip. It was... um, small confusion for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, tipping can be confusing even for people here. But you’re right, it’s expected in the U.S.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think so. But I like learning new culture. It is... good experience.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! I love how open you are to new things. Thanks for sharing all this with me.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you for listen! It was nice to talk about my trip.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! Let’s catch up again soon. Bye!  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you next time. Goodbye!
