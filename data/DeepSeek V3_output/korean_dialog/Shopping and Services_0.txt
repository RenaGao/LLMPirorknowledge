**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How can I help you today?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, hello. I want to buy... um, thing for watching movie. At home. How to say...  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, do you mean a TV?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, TV! But not too big. I need... medium size. Can you recommend?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! We have a few good options. What’s your budget?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... not more than 500 dollar.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Here’s one that’s 40 inches and costs $450. It has good picture quality.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** 40 inches... is it too big for small room?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Not at all! It’s perfect for a medium-sized room. Would you like to see it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, please. How about the sound? Is it... um... loud enough?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The sound is clear, but you can always add external speakers if you want it louder.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. External speaker is... extra thing, right?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. For now, the TV’s sound will work well for movies.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay. And the... warranty? How long is it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** This one comes with a one-year warranty.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** One year... that’s good. I think I will buy it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! Shall I help you with the payment?  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, please. And can you deliver? My home is... um... far from here.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. We can arrange delivery for you.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you so much. You are very helpful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Enjoy your new TV. Let me know if you need anything else.  
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. Goodbye and thank you again!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day.  

(The conversation ends with both speakers saying goodbye and expressing gratitude.)
