**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! Let’s plan the team meeting for next week. Are you available on Wednesday morning?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, I think I am free. Um, what time?  
**Speaker A (NS):** How about 10 a.m.? Is that okay for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, 10 a.m. is fine. But... um, maybe we can make it 10:30? I have one thing to finish before.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, 10:30 works. What topics should we include in the agenda?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hmm... I think we talk about new project first. And then, um... how to say... the budget?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The budget plan?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, budget plan. Also, um... team... team work schedule?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The team schedule, got it. Should we also discuss the upcoming training session?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, training! Yes, I forget. We must talk about that too. And maybe... um, ask feedback from team?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea. Let’s add a feedback session. So, the agenda will be: new project, budget plan, team schedule, training, and feedback.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that sound good. I will... um, prepare some note for new project part.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll handle the budget plan and training. Can you take care of the team schedule and feedback?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I can do that. Um... where we meet? In meeting room?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, Meeting Room 3. I’ll book it and send everyone a calendar invite later.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, thank you. I feel... um, more confident now. See you Wednesday!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! See you then. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Goodbye!
