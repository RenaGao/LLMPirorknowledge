**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Nuch! Do you have a minute to talk about the upcoming test?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I have. I think, um, test is next week. I feel a little nervous.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry, we can study together. Have you started preparing yet?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Not yet. I want to start, but I don’t know... how to say, good way to study.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay. Maybe we can make a study plan. What’s the hardest part for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** For me, grammar is difficult, especially... uh, what is it, present perfect?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the present perfect? Yes, it can be tricky. We can practice that together.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is good idea. Also, I need help with... um, listening part.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. We can listen to some English podcasts or videos to practice.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Podcasts? What is that?  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s like a radio show you can listen to on your phone. It’s great for listening practice.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I see. I will try. Thank you for... um, explaining.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! How about we meet tomorrow to start studying?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Tomorrow is good for me. What time?  
**Speaker A (NS):** How about 3 PM at the library?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, 3 PM is okay. I will bring my... um, note and book.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll bring some practice exercises too.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Good idea. I think together we can... do better.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Teamwork makes it easier. See you tomorrow at 3 PM, then.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, see you tomorrow. Thank you for help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Good luck with your studies until then.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. I will try my best. See you!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you soon!
