**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello, um... I want to return this thing. I buy it last week.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Do you have the receipt with you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I have... here. But, um, the thing is... it not work.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. May I ask what’s wrong with it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is... how to say... when I press button, nothing happen.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, it’s not turning on?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes. Not turning on. I try many times.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, no problem. Let me check the receipt. You bought it seven days ago, so it’s still within our return policy.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, good. Can I get... um, money back?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure thing. Let me process that for you.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. You are very kind.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Here’s your refund. Please count it to make sure it’s correct.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay... yes, it’s correct. Thank you so much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Is there anything else I can help you with?
