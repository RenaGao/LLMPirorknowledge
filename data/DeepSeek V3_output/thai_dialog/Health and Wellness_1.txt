**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Pim! How have you been lately?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I’m okay, but... um, I feel tired many time. Maybe because of work.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s not good. Have you been taking care of yourself?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I try, but... um, I not sleep enough, and I eat fast food many time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That could be why you’re feeling tired. Maybe you should try to sleep more and eat healthier?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I think so. But I don’t know... how to say... healthy food recipe.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay! You can start with simple things, like eating more vegetables and drinking water instead of soda.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, vegetables... yes, I like it. But I think I need to... cook it. How to do?  

**Speaker A (NS):** You can steam or stir-fry them. It’s quick and easy. Do you exercise too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Exercise? Um... sometimes I walk, but not much.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Walking is great! Maybe you can try doing it 30 minutes every day. It helps your body and mind.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I will try. And... um, I think I need to sleep more early.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, sleep is important. Maybe you can set a bedtime, like 10 PM?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** 10 PM? Oh, I think it’s good idea. I will do it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, let’s summarize: more vegetables, less fast food, walking, and earlier bedtime. Sound good?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, sound good! Thank you for help me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let’s check in next week and see how it’s going.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, see you next week!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Pim!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Bye!
