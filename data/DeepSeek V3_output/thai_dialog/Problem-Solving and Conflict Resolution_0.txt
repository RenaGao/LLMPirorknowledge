**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! I’m glad we’re talking. I wanted to clear up something about our plan this Saturday.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. I also want talk about it. Please tell me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I thought we agreed to meet at 8:30 in the morning at Chatuchak Park, but my friend said you mentioned 9:00.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, um... I think maybe I make mistake. I remember 8:30, but maybe I say wrong to your friend. Sorry for that.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all! So, just to confirm, 8:30 is still okay?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, 8:30 is fine. I will come on time. I prepare food, like I say before.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll bring drinks, as we agreed.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That’s good! I hope weather is nice. How to say... not too hot.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I hope it’s not too hot either. Maybe we can find some shade when we’re tired.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that’s good idea. And we can also... um, sit near the lake?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Near the lake sounds lovely. I’m really looking forward to it.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Me too. I’m happy we fix this... misunderstanding.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. It’s good we talked about it.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, communication is important. I learn this.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Well, I’ll see you on Saturday at 8:30 then.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you on Saturday. And thank you for talk with me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Have a great day, Lek!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! See you soon. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!  

(The conversation ends with both speakers confirming the plan and expressing gratitude for resolving the misunderstanding.)
