**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! Do you have a minute? I want to plan a surprise for Lek’s birthday with our group.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! I have time. Lek’s birthday is coming soon. We should do something special.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Do you have any ideas for what we can do?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe we can make a party at her home. She like... uh, how to say... when we all together.

**Speaker A (NS):** A gathering? Like a small party?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, small party. We can cook food, play games, and... uh, give her gift.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! What kind of food should we make?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** She like Thai food. Maybe we make som tam and... um, pad thai? I can help cook.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll handle the games. Should we invite others from our group?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we invite Pim and Nam too. They like Lek. It will be... uh, more fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. When should we have the party? Her birthday is on Saturday.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe Friday evening? She is free then. We can say we meet for... um, how to say... casual dinner. But it is surprise.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. We’ll keep it a secret. What about decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We can buy balloons and... uh, birthday banner. I see in shop near my home.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll help with that. Do you want to handle the food and drinks?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I prepare food and drinks. You do games and decoration.

**Speaker A (NS):** Deal! Let’s meet on Thursday evening to finalize everything.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, Thursday is good. I will tell Pim and Nam about plan.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! This is going to be a wonderful surprise. Thanks for helping, Nuch.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you too! Lek will very happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s make it the best birthday for her. See you on Thursday!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** See you Thursday. Bye!
