**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nam. How’s it going? Do you need help with something?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello, Teacher. Yes, I have... um, question about homework.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, what’s the question?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** The exercise about, uh, past tense. I not sure... how to write sentence correct.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the past tense exercises. Which part is confusing?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** The sentence... um, "She go to market yesterday." I think it wrong, but I don’t know how fix.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. The word "go" needs to change because it’s in the past. Do you remember the past tense of "go"?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... "went"?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! So the sentence should be "She went to the market yesterday."  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! Thank you. And what about... "He have a book"?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s present tense. For past tense, it’s "He had a book."  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** "He had." Okay, I think I understand now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s try one more. What’s the past tense of "eat"?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** "Ate."  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. You’re getting it!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, Teacher. Your explain very clear.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Nam. Let me know if you have more questions.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will ask if I... um, need more help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Good luck with your homework!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, Teacher. See you next class!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you then!
