**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, welcome to the team! Let me explain your first task. It's about organizing the new files.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. I understand. Files... um, where is it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The files are on the shared drive. I’ll send you the link.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, thank you. I will check it. What I need to do?  
**Speaker A (NS):** You need to sort them by date and label them correctly.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sort by... date? And label? How... how to say, what is correct label?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The label should include the project name and date, like “ProjectX_2023-10.”  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, I see. Project name and date together. Okay.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Let me know if you have questions.
