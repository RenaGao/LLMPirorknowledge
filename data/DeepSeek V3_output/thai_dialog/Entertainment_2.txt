**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Do you enjoy reading books?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! I like reading very much. But I read slowly because English is... um, not my first language.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay! Do you have a favorite book you’d like to recommend?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like book called... um... *The Alchemist*. It’s my favorite.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of it! What’s it about?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It’s about... how to say... boy who travel to find his... um, dream? Yes, his dream. It teaches about life and... uh... trying hard for what you want.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds inspiring. Why do you think someone should read it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think it make you strong in... um, in your heart. It helps when you feel lost. And it’s not too long, so it’s good for people who... um... don’t like big books.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great reason! Do you think it’s easy to understand?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it’s written simple. Even for me, I can understand most. But sometimes I need to check... um, dictionary for words.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good way to learn. Have you read it more than once?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes! I read two times. First time in Thai, but second time in English. It’s different... um, how to say... experience?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting. Reading it in both languages must give you a deeper understanding.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I think so. It’s like learning twice.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll definitely give it a try. Thanks for the recommendation!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You’re welcome. I hope you like it too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure I will. Let me know if you recommend any other books in the future.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay! I will think about it. Thank you for talking with me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** It was nice chatting with you. Take care!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too. Bye-bye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
