**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! I’ve been curious about Thai dining etiquette. Can you tell me about some cultural differences compared to Western dining?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! In Thailand, we have many different... um, how to say... customs. For example, we use spoon and fork to eat, not knife.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Really? That’s interesting. So, no knives at all?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, no knife. We use fork to push food onto spoon. And we eat rice with spoon.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What about sharing food? Is that common?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! In Thailand, we share food. Everyone take from same plate. It is... um, how to say... show we are close.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice. In some Western countries, we also share food, but usually everyone has their own plate.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, in Thailand, we think sharing food make... um, make people feel like family.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really beautiful. What about... ah, do you have any rules about finishing your food?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, in Thailand, it is polite to finish food. If you not finish, host may think you not like it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s good to know. In some cultures, finishing everything might seem like you’re still hungry.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it is different. Also, in Thailand, we not start eating until oldest person start. It is... um, respect.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a really nice tradition. What about drinking? Are there any customs there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! When we drink, we hold glass with two hands. It is polite. And we say “cheers” with “chon gâew.”  

**Speaker A (NS):** “Chon gâew”? What does that mean?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It mean... um, “empty glass.” But we not need to drink all, just say it to show friendly.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really interesting. I’ve learned so much today!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Me too! I like talking about Thai culture. It is fun.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Thanks for sharing all this with me.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You’re welcome! Next time, maybe I can learn more about your culture too.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Let’s plan that soon.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, see you next time!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you! Take care!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, you too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Nuch!
