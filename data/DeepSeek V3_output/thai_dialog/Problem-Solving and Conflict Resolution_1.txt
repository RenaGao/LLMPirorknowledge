**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I heard you’re having some trouble with your internet service. What’s going on?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. My internet... it is very slow. I cannot watch video or open webpage.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s frustrating. Have you tried restarting your router?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I try. But it still slow. Maybe the router is... um, how to say... broken?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Could the router be outdated? Or maybe the problem is with the service provider. Have you contacted them?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, not yet. I don’t know how to... um, explain in English.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, I can help. You can call them and say, “My internet is very slow. Can you check the connection?”  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I can try. But what if they don’t understand me?  

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s alright. Most providers have customer service in multiple languages, or they’ll find someone who can help.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, that is good! I will call them today.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let me know if you need help writing down what to say.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you very much. You are very kind.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I hope they fix it quickly.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Me too. If not, maybe I will change the... um, company?  

**Speaker A (NS):** The service provider? That’s always an option if they don’t solve the issue.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, service provider. Thank you for your advice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let me know how it goes.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure. I will tell you later. Thank you again!  

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries. Good luck, and have a great day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!  

*The conversation ends with both speakers exchanging farewells and expressing gratitude for the help provided.*
