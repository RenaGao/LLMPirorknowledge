**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, chills.  

**Speaker A (NS):** How long have you had these symptoms?

**Speaker A (NS):** Paracetamol, okay. Did it help?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** A little, but not much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Let’s start with your temperature.  

**[A moment passes while Speaker A checks the temperature and throat.]**  

**Speaker A (NS):** Your temperature is high, and your throat looks inflamed. I think you might have a throat infection.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, I see. What I can do?
