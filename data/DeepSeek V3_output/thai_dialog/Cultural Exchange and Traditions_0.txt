**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Nuch! How’s it going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I’m good, thank you. How about you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I was wondering, could you tell me about a tradition or festival from your culture?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! In Thailand, we have Songkran. It is... um, Thai New Year.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting. What do people do during Songkran?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We, um, throw water. Everyone throw water to each other. It is for, uh... how to say... clean and good luck for new year.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds fun! Do you have any special food or activities during Songkran?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we eat food like... khao chae. It is rice in cold water with, um, side dish. And we also go to temple to pray and... uh, pour water on Buddha statue.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fascinating. Is Songkran celebrated all over Thailand?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, everywhere! But some place, um, have big party with music and, uh, people come from other country too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a really lively festival. Do you usually celebrate with your family?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, my family and friends. We spend time together and... um, have fun with water.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. Do you have any special memories from Songkran?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! Last year, I go to Chiang Mai. It is very famous for Songkran. The water fight there is... um, how to say... very big and exciting!  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing. I’d love to experience it someday.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You should come! I think you will enjoy it very much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to! Thanks for sharing, Nuch. It’s really interesting to learn about your culture.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You are welcome! I’m happy to tell you. If you come, I will show you everything.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so kind of you. Let’s keep in touch, and maybe I’ll visit during Songkran next year.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, let’s! I will plan for you. Thank you for listening.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for sharing, Nuch. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! See you later!  

**Final sentence:** It’s been great learning about Songkran from you, Nuch!
