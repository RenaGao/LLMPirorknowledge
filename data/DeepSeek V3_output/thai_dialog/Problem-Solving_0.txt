**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, I noticed you seemed a bit upset with me yesterday. Did I do something wrong?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, um... yes, I feel little... how to say... unhappy. Because you not come to our lunch.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Wait, we had plans for lunch? I don’t remember that.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we talk on Monday. You say, "Let’s meet on Thursday." I wait for you, but you not come.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no! I’m so sorry. I thought we were just talking about Thursday, not making plans. That’s my fault.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It’s okay. But next time, maybe you say clearly? So I not wait and feel... disappointed.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re absolutely right. I’ll make sure to confirm plans clearly next time. I feel terrible for making you wait.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, no, it’s okay. I understand. Sometimes we have mis... miscommunication.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, miscommunication happens. I’m really glad you told me how you felt.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes. In my culture, we say directly, but also try to not make... too much trouble.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good. It’s important to be honest with each other.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes. So, next time, we confirm plan together. Okay?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. I promise I’ll double-check with you next time.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. I feel better now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Thanks for being patient with me.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You’re welcome. Let’s meet again soon.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, let’s. How about we plan for lunch next week?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That sound good. I will wait your message.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll text you the details. Thanks for talking this through.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No problem. Have a good day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too! See you soon.
