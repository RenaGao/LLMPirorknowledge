**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sora! I heard we have a test coming up. How’s your preparation going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, I study… um, but I feel not ready. There are many things to remember.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I know, it can be overwhelming. What do you find most difficult?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Vocabulary is hard. And also… grammar rules. They are complicated.  
**Speaker A (NS):** For vocabulary, maybe flashcards could help. Do you use them?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Flashcards? Uh, no, I not use them yet. But it sounds good idea.  
**Speaker A (NS):** They really help me. And for grammar, try writing sentences using the rules. Practice makes perfect!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Writing sentences? Yes, I can try. But sometimes I don’t know… how to make correct sentence.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay! You can ask me or check examples. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I will try. How about you? Are you ready for test?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Almost! I’ve been reviewing a lot, but I’m still a little nervous.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Me too. Maybe we can study together? It is more… um, easier with friend.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! Let’s meet at the library tomorrow after class.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, good plan. What time is best for you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** How about 3 p.m.?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** 3 p.m. is okay. I will come.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Don’t forget to bring your notes and flashcards.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will bring them. Thank you for your help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let’s do our best and crush this test.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, let’s do our best. See you tomorrow!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow, Sora!
