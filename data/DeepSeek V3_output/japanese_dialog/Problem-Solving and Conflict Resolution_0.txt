**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! I was a bit confused when you canceled our plans last week. Was everything okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello. I’m very sorry for cancel. I had... um, sudden problem with work.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. That's understandable. Did you manage to resolve it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is okay now. But I feel bad for canceling. Maybe I should... um, tell you sooner next time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great. I was just worried something had happened. Thanks for letting me know.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I’m okay. Thank you for worried about me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I’m glad everything’s fine. Should we reschedule?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, please. How about next Saturday?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Next Saturday works for me. What time?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, maybe 2 p.m.?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s meet at the café again?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, café is good. I am looking forward to it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Thanks for clearing things up, Sora.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you for understand. I am happy we can talk about this.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. Friends talk things through. See you next Saturday then!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you next Saturday. Have a good week!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Sora. Take care!
