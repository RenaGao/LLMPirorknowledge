**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me about your goals for the next year?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, um… my goal is to improve my English. I think it is important for my job.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great goal! How do you plan to improve it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I will study every day. Maybe… um, 30 minutes? And I want to practice speaking more.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. Do you have any specific methods in mind? Like, will you use apps or take classes?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I use… um, how to say… YouTube? To listen English video. And I find teacher for speaking practice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Listening and speaking practice will really help. Do you have any other goals for next year?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to travel. I plan to visit… um… Australia. But I need save money first.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s exciting! How will you save money for the trip?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I will eat… um, less outside. And I stop buy… uh, unnecessary thing.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a smart approach. Australia is a beautiful country. What do you want to do there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I want see… nature. Like beach and forest. And I want practice English with local people.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fantastic. It’s a great way to combine travel and language learning.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I hope so. But I am little nervous. My English is not yet perfect.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry. Most people will appreciate your effort. Just keep practicing, and you’ll improve quickly.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I will try my best.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Sounds like you have a good plan for next year.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I am excited. Thank you for listening.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Good luck with your goals, and I hope you enjoy your trip to Australia.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you very much. I will work hard. See you again!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, and have a great day!
