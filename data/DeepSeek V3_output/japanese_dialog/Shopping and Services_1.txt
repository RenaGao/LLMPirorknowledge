**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, a camera! Are you looking for a compact one or something more advanced?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** More advanced, I think. For taking... um, how to say... nature photo. Mountain, river, flower.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So you want a camera that’s good for landscapes, right?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, landscape. And also, um... night photo. With stars.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! This one here is more affordable. It’s $500 and still great for landscapes and night shots.
