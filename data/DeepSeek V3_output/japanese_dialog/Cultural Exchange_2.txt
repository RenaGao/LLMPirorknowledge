**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I heard you're from Japan. I’m curious, what's your favorite holiday there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! My favorite holiday is... um, how to say... New Year. It is called "Oshogatsu" in Japanese.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, New Year! That’s interesting. What do people usually do during Oshogatsu?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We eat special food called "osechi," and we visit temple to pray... um, for good luck in new year. And also, we spend time with family.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really nice. Is there any other tradition you like?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! We watch... um... special TV program. It is funny and happy, and we stay up until midnight.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Do you have any special memories from Oshogatsu?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, when I was child, my family go to temple together. It was very cold, but the air is... um... fresh. I remember it very well.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s lovely. It sounds like a wonderful time to be with family. What about food? What’s your favorite part of osechi?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I like... um... black beans. They are sweet and... um... meaning good health. And also, fish cake. It is colorful and tasty.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! I’d love to try it someday. Thanks for sharing about Oshogatsu. It’s really fascinating.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you for listen! If you come to Japan, I can show you more about it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Thanks for the chat. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! Let’s talk again soon!
