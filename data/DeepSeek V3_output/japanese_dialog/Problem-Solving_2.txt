**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, I noticed there was an issue with the report you submitted this morning. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, I am very sorry for the mistake. I… um, how to say… I didn’t check the data carefully.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay. Mistakes happen. What exactly went wrong?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** The numbers… um, the numbers were not correct. I think I make mistake with the calculation.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you know where the error occurred?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Uh, maybe in the… the sales part. I will check again and fix it.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good plan. How long do you think it will take to correct?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe… um, one hour? I will do it now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Let me know if you need any help.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you. I will send the correct report soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. I appreciate your quick response.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I am really sorry again for the trouble.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries. Thanks for taking care of it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will be careful next time. Thank you for understanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. Let’s double-check together in the future to avoid this.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That is good idea. I will do my best.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m confident you will. Keep up the good work!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I will send the report soon. See you later.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later. Take care!
