**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m interested in this wooden bowl. How much does it cost?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! This bowl is... um, 3,000 yen. About... 20 dollars?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. It’s beautiful, but it’s a bit expensive for me. Could you lower the price?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm... lower? Maybe... 2,500 yen? It is... very good wood. Handmade.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s handmade, but I was thinking more like 2,000 yen. Is that okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... 2,000 yen is... a little low. But, because you seem nice person, I can do... 2,300 yen.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s kind of you! How about 2,200 yen? I’ll take good care of it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah... okay, 2,200 yen. But please, um... tell your friends about my shop!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Deal! I’ll definitely recommend your shop. It’s a beautiful place.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I will wrap it... um... in paper for you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect. Here’s 2,200 yen. Thank you so much!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you too! Please, come back again. Have a nice day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too! I’ll see you next time. Take care!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you! Goodbye!
