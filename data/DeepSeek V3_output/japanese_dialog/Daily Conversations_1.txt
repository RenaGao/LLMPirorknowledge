**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi! Um, yes, I have some plan. I think I want to visit city near here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds nice! Which city are you thinking of?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, how to say... it is famous for food and temple. Um, Kyoto? Yes, Kyoto.

**Speaker A (NS):** Kyoto is amazing! What do you want to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I want to see, um, old temple and try, uh, Kyoto food. It is very... how to say... traditional?

**Speaker A (NS):** Traditional, yes. Kyoto is known for its history and culture. Are you going with anyone?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I go with my friend. She also like to go there.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! How will you get to Kyoto?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think to take, um, fast train. Shinkansen? But maybe expensive.

**Speaker A (NS):** The bullet train is fast, but it can be pricey. Have you thought about the bus?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, bus is also good idea. It is... how to say... cheaper.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. And it’s still comfortable. What time are you leaving?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We plan to leave on Saturday morning, um, nine o’clock.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good time. You’ll have the whole day to explore. Is there anything specific you want to see?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to see, um, Kinkaku-ji. It is... gold temple? Very beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion! It’s stunning. You’ll love it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I think so too. And I want to eat... um, Kyoto dessert.

**Speaker A (NS):** Kyoto is famous for its sweets. You have to try matcha desserts!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, matcha! I heard it is very good.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you’ll have a fantastic time. Let me know how it goes!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will tell you. Thank you for talking with me. See you!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Have a great trip, and see you soon!
