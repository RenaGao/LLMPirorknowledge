**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kenta. Do you have a moment to talk about the project deadline?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I have time. What about deadline?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The client needs the final report by next Friday. Is that possible for your team?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Next... Friday? Um, I think maybe difficult. Why client need so soon?  
**Speaker A (NS):** They’re on a tight schedule for their new product launch. Can we adjust your team’s timeline?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Adjust... um, let me see. My team now work on, uh, data part. Maybe finish by Wednesday.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good. Can you delegate some tasks to others to speed up the process?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I can ask... um, Tanaka-san to help with analysis. But I worry about, uh, quality.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Maybe we can do a quick review before submitting?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, review is good. If you check, I feel more confidence... um, confident.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s aim to finish the report by Thursday, so we have time for a review.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay. I will tell team to finish by Thursday. And I send draft to you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Thanks for being flexible, Kenta. I appreciate your hard work.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you too. I will do my best. And um... if problem happen, I tell you right away.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Let’s keep in touch this week. Good luck!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, let’s talk again. Thank you for your support.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Have a great day, Kenta.
