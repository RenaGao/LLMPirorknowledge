**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Can you tell me about a recent memorable event in your life?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I have one. Last week, I go to... um, flower park with my friend.  

**Speaker A (NS):** A flower park? That sounds lovely. What was it like?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It was very beautiful. Many sakura... um, cherry blossom. And also, many people come to see.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, cherry blossoms! That’s a special time in Japan, right?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, very special. We take many photos and eat... um, picnic? Under the tree.  

**Speaker A (NS):** A picnic under the cherry blossoms? That must have been so peaceful.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, peaceful. And... um, how to say... happy. I feel very happy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. Did you do anything else there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We walk around park and see small shop. They sell... um, food like dango. It is sweet.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Dango? I’ve heard of that. Is it a kind of rice dumpling?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! Rice dumpling with sweet sauce. It is very delicious.  

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a perfect day. How did it make you feel overall?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I feel... um, thankful. Thankful for nature and friend. It was very... memorable.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so nice to hear. I’m glad you had such a wonderful experience.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I think I will go again next year.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. Thanks for sharing your story with me!  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you for listening. Um, I must go now. See you later!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, and have a great day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! I hope you have many more memorable days like that one.
