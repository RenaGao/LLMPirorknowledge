**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’ve heard Japan has some amazing festivals. Could you tell me about one?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! Japanese festival... um, I think Obon is very special. It is for, uh, respecting ancestors.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting. When does Obon usually take place?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Usually in... August, but some place is July. People visit family grave and clean it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice. Are there any special activities during Obon?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, people make food offering, and... um, there is dance called Bon Odori. It is traditional dance.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Is it danced to special music?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, music is... um, folk music? People wear yukata, it is... light kimono, and dance in circle.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of yukata! Do people also light lanterns during Obon?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, lantern is... very important. People put lantern in river or sea to guide ancestor spirits.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s beautiful. Are there any specific foods eaten during Obon?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes. We eat... oh, how to say... dumpling? Oh, mochi, and also somen, it is cold noodle.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Is Obon celebrated everywhere in Japan?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Mostly, yes. But... each area has little different way. For example, in Kyoto, there is Gozan no Okuribi, it is... big fire on mountain.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that must be amazing to see! Thank you for sharing. It sounds like a meaningful tradition.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is very important for Japanese people. I hope you can see it one day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to. Thanks again for explaining, and I hope you have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you too! Have a nice day, and goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
