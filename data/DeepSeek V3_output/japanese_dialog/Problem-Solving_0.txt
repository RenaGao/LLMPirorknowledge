**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! Thanks for meeting me. I wanted to talk about something that’s been bothering me.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. What is it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Well, last week, you said you couldn’t come to my party because you had to work, but I saw you at the park with some friends. I felt a bit… upset about that.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh! I am very sorry. Um… how to say… I think there is misunderstanding.  
**Speaker A (NS):** A misunderstanding? Can you explain?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes. I work in the morning, but… uh, in the afternoon my boss say, “You can go home early.” So, I meet friends in park. But, I forget to tell you I am free.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. So you weren’t avoiding me?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, no! I really want to come to your party, but I think it is too late to say “I can come” now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s just that I felt left out when I saw you there.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I am very sorry. I should tell you my plan change. Please forgive me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I forgive you. I’m just glad we could talk about it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you for… uh, how to say… understanding me. Next time, I will think more.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good. Let’s make sure we communicate better next time.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I agree. Thank you for telling me your feeling.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. It’s important to me that we’re honest with each other.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, honesty is very important. I will remember this.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great. I’m glad we sorted this out. Let’s catch up soon!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, let’s meet again. Thank you, and… um, see you later!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, Yuki! Take care.
