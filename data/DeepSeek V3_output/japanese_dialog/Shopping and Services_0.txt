**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can I help you find something today?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, thank you. I, um… looking for tea. But I don’t know which one is good. Can you… recommend?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Do you prefer black tea, green tea, or something else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like green tea, but sometimes I want to try new thing. Maybe something… different?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Hmm, if you want something different, how about jasmine tea? It has a floral aroma and goes well with green tea blends.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Jasmine tea? Hmm, I think I hear about it before. Is it… sweet?  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s not exactly sweet, but it has a light, fragrant flavor. It’s very refreshing.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see. Um, how much is it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** This one here is $6 for a pack of 20 tea bags. It’s a great value for the quality.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, that’s… not too expensive. I think I will try it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! Jaspery’s Jasmine Tea is one of our top sellers. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I will… um, take it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let me ring that up for you.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay. And, do you have… um, suggestion for best way to drink it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! I recommend steeping it for about 3 minutes. Add a little honey if you like it sweeter.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, honey is good idea. Thank you so much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I hope you enjoy it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I’m sure I will. Thank you… for your help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a wonderful day!
