**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I’d love to hear about your favorite hobby. What do you enjoy doing in your free time?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! My favorite hobby is... um, photography. I like take picture of nature and city.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! Do you have a favorite subject to photograph?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I like... how to say... sunset and temple. It is very beautiful, especially in Kyoto.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Kyoto? That’s such a photogenic city. Do you use a professional camera?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I use DSLR camera. But sometimes, I use smartphone because it is, um, easy to carry.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. Do you edit your photos after taking them?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I use... um, software for edit. Lightroom? It is very useful for making color more bright.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Lightroom is great! Have you ever shared your photos online?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I have Instagram account. I post pictures there. Um, but not so many follower.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay. It’s more about enjoying the process, right? What do you like most about photography?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like... capturing moment. It is, um, how to say... memory for me. I can remember feeling when I see photo.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a beautiful way to think about it. Do you ever take portraits, or is it mostly landscapes?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Mostly landscape. I try portrait, but it is difficult because people move, um, too much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I understand. It can be challenging. Do you have any tips for beginner photographers?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I think... um, practice is important. And also, try take picture in different light. It make big difference.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great advice! Thanks for sharing. Do you have any photography goals for the future?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to make... um, photo book. Maybe about Japan’s four season.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like an amazing project! I’d love to see it when it’s done.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I will try my best.
