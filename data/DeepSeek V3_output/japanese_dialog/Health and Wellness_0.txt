**Speaker A (NS):** Hello! How are you feeling today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello. Um, I feel... not so good. I have... pain in my stomach.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the pain?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes. It is... um... how to say... like sharp pain. Start yesterday morning.  

**Speaker A (NS):** A sharp pain? Is it constant or does it come and go?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not constant. It come and go. Sometimes stronger, sometimes... weaker.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you have any other symptoms?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes. I feel... um... tired. And sometimes... uh... nausea.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Nausea? Have you vomited?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, no vomit. Just feel like... want to vomit.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Understood. Have you eaten anything unusual recently?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... I eat sushi two days ago. Maybe... not fresh?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That could be a factor. Have you had any fever or diarrhea?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No fever. But... diarrhea, yes. Two times yesterday.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. It sounds like it could be food-related. Have you taken any medicine?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I not take medicine. I wait to see if it go away.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I think it’s best to give you some medicine to help with the pain and nausea. Also, drink plenty of water and rest.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I understand. Thank you very much.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. If the pain gets worse or you have a fever, please come back immediately.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Thank you, doctor.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care of yourself. I hope you feel better soon.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I will take the medicine and rest.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good. Have a nice day, and feel free to call if you need anything.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Goodbye, doctor.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care.
