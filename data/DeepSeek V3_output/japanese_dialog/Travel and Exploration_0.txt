**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Rina! I heard you’re planning a trip with some friends. Where are you thinking of going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! We want to go to... um, San Francisco. It is city by sea, very famous.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, San Francisco is beautiful! What do you want to do there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We want to see Golden Gate Bridge. And... um, how to say... the house with many color?  
**Speaker A (NS):** You mean the Painted Ladies?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! Painted Ladies. Also, we want to eat... um, seafood.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great plan. Have you checked the transportation? How will you get around?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I think we use bus. But in Japan, subway is more easy. Maybe we try both?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. The buses and trams in San Francisco are pretty convenient. What about where to stay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We are thinking... um, hotel near center. But it is little expensive. Maybe we share room.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sharing a room is a good way to save money. How many friends are going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Four persons. We are very excited, but... um, I worry about time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** What do you mean? The timing of the trip?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes. We have only three days. Is it enough?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Three days is enough to see the main attractions. You’ll just need to plan carefully.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see. We will make list of places to go. And... um, any food we must try?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely try clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. It’s a San Francisco specialty.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Clam chowder? Sounds interesting. I will tell my friends. Thank you for advice!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! When are you planning to go?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Next month. We book flight next week.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s exciting! Let me know how it goes.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will tell you after trip. Thank you for helping me plan!  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Have a great trip, and take lots of pictures.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I will. See you later!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, Rina!
