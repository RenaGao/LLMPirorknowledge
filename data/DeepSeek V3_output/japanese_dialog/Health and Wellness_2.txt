**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m here to help you set up an exercise routine. Can you tell me about your current fitness goals?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! Thank you. My goal is, um... to lose little weight and get more healthy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great goal. Do you have any specific exercises you enjoy or want to try?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like walking. But I want to try... how to say... lifting heavy thing? Not too heavy, but...  
**Speaker A (NS):** You mean weight training?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, weight training! I think it is good for body.  
**Speaker A (NS):** It definitely is. How often do you walk now?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I walk... maybe three time in week. But I want to do more.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so we can add more walking and some weight training. Maybe start with lighter weights and increase gradually.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that sounds good. Um... how much weight I should start?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s start with 2-3 kilograms for arms and 5-7 kilograms for legs. Does that work?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is good. I think I can do it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And how about stretching? Do you do any stretching now?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I not... um, not much. But I know it is important.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it’s very important. I can show you some simple stretches to do before and after exercise.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I will try it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s plan for 4 days of walking, 2 days of weight training, and stretching every day. Does that sound okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I think I can do it. I will start tomorrow.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Let me know if you have any questions or need help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you very much! I will do my best.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Good luck, and I’m here to support you.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you so much. Have good day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Goodbye!
