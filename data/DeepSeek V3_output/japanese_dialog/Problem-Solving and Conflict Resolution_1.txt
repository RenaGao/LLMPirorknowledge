Here’s a conversation between a native English speaker (NS) and a Japanese L2 speaker (L2) discussing a technical issue with a service provider:

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I heard you’re having trouble with your internet service. Can you tell me what’s going on?  
**Speaker B (L2):** Yes, my internet is very slow. It is... um, not working well since yesterday.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s frustrating. Have you tried restarting your router?  
**Speaker B (L2):** Yes, I try this, but... still same problem. Maybe something wrong with provider?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Could be. Did you contact them about it?  
**Speaker B (L2):** Not yet. I think... how to say... I don’t know how to explain it in English.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay! You can describe it as best as you can. Did you check if there’s an outage in your area?  
**Speaker B (L2):** Oh, outage? Sorry, I don’t know this word.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! An outage means the service is down for many people in your area.  
**Speaker B (L2):** Ah, I see. I didn’t check this, but maybe I should do it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. You can check on their website or call their customer service.  
**Speaker B (L2):** Calling is difficult for me because... my English is not so good.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s understandable. Maybe you can use their live chat or email support?  
**Speaker B (L2):** Live chat? Yes, that is better. I can use chat.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let me know if you need help writing the message.  
**Speaker B (L2):** Thank you very much. You are very kind.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Did you want me to help you draft something now?  
**Speaker B (L2):** Yes, please. I want to say... my internet is slow, and restart router doesn’t fix it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. I’ll write: “My internet has been very slow since yesterday, and restarting the router didn’t help. Could you check if there’s an issue in my area?”  
**Speaker B (L2):** Perfect! Thank you so much. I will send this now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let me know if they respond or if you need more help.  
**Speaker B (L2):** I will. Thank you again for your kind help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Good luck, and I hope your internet gets fixed soon!  
**Speaker B (L2):** Yes, I hope too. Thank you, and
