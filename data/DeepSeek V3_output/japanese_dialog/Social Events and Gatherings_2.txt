**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s cool! I like anime too. What’s your favorite one?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** My favorite is... uh, "Attack on Titan." It is very exciting.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I’ve heard it’s great! I haven’t watched it yet, but I’ll add it to my list. Do you like other genres too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I also like... um, comedy and sports anime.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice! What about sports anime? Do you have a favorite?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** My favorite is "Haikyuu!!" It is about volleyball.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I love "Haikyuu!!" too! The characters are so inspiring. Have you played volleyball yourself?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I play in high school. It was very fun.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome! Do you still play now?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not much now. I do... um, jogging sometimes.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Jogging is a great way to stay active. Do you jog in the mornings or evenings?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Usually in the mornings. It is... how to say... refreshing.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree! Mornings are the best time for jogging. Do you listen to music while you run?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I listen to... anime music. It makes me happy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! I should try that sometime. Hey, Takashi, it’s been great talking with you. Let’s chat again sometime!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it was very nice talking with you too. Let’s meet again.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, and enjoy your jogging!
