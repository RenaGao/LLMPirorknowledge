**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Rika! What can I help you with today?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello, Mr. Johnson. I... um, have question about the assignment. I don't understand... how to say... the part about research.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Do you mean the part where you need to find sources for your topic?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that part. I not sure... what kind of source is okay? Books? Or only Internet?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Both are fine! You can use books, articles, or websites, but make sure they’re reliable. For example, academic journals or trusted websites.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Reliable? You mean... um, not fake news?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Avoid unreliable sources like blogs or random websites. Stick to well-known ones.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I understand. And how many source I need?  
**Speaker A (NS):** You need at least three sources. But you can use more if you want.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay. And... um, if I find source, what I do next? Write summary?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, write a short summary of each source and explain how it helps your topic.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see. Thank you very much. This is more clear now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let me know if you have more questions.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Um, Mr. Johnson, when is the... due date?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The assignment is due next Friday. You have plenty of time.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, that’s good. I will start soon. Thank you again!  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Good luck, Rika. Let me know if you need help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Rika!
