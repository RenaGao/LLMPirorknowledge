**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! I heard it’s Rika’s birthday next week. Do you want to plan a surprise for her with the group?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I think it is good idea. Rika is very kind, so she will be happy, I think.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What do you think we should do? Maybe a party or something smaller?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... party is good, but maybe... how to say... not too many people? She like calm thing, I think.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. How about a small dinner at her favorite restaurant?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, yes! She like sushi very much. There is... um... sushi place near her house.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll call and reserve a table. Should we invite the whole group or just a few people?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think maybe five or six people is enough. Too many people... um... make her feel… nervous?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Good point. I’ll check with the others. What about a gift? Do you have any ideas?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. She like reading books. Maybe we give her... um... new book?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s thoughtful. Do you know what kind of books she likes?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** She like... um... mystery and history... um, how to say... history mystery?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Historical mysteries?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! Historical mystery. I think she will like it very much.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. I’ll pick one up. What about decorations? Should we bring something to the restaurant?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe... um... small balloon and card? Not too big, but... um... festive?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice. I’ll get a card, and you can bring the balloons?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I can do it. Thank you for planning with me!  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let’s meet at the restaurant at 6 p.m. on her birthday.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, 6 p.m. is good. I will... um... come early to set up balloon.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! See you then. And let’s make sure Rika has the best birthday ever!  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! I think she will be very surprised and happy. See you next week!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you, Yuki! Let’s check in a few days to make sure everything’s ready.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, let’s talk again before the day. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Yuki!
