**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Yuki! Thanks for joining me. I wanted to talk about planning a surprise party for Hana. What do you think?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, surprise party for Hana? That is… very good idea! She will be happy, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, she’s been working so hard lately. I thought it’d be nice to celebrate her. Do you have any ideas for the party?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um… maybe we can do at her favorite restaurant? Or… how to say… at someone’s house?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good suggestions! Her favorite restaurant might be easier. What about decorations?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, decorations… maybe balloons and… um… banner? Like, “Welcome Hana!” or something.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! We can make a banner that says, “Happy Birthday, Hana!” since her birthday is next week.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is nice. And… um… we need cake, right? Hana likes… strawberry cake.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea. I’ll order the cake. What about inviting people? Who should we ask?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe her… closest friends? Like, Miki, Rina, and… um… Kenji. Also, her family if they can come.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. I’ll make a list and send invitations. Do you think we should keep it a secret until the day?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is surprise, so we must keep secret. But… um… how to tell her to come?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good point. Maybe I can tell her we’re having a small dinner together, just the two of us.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, that is clever! She will not suspect.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. I’ll handle that. What about timing? Should we do the party next Saturday evening?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, Saturday evening is good. Most people can come, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So we’ll have dinner at her favorite restaurant, with decorations, cake, and her closest friends. Anything else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um… maybe… small gift? Like, something she really likes.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we can all chip in for a nice gift. Maybe something she’s been wanting for a while.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is good idea. I think she will be very happy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I think so too. Thanks for your help, Yuki! Let’s talk again next week to finalize things.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you too! I am excited for Hana. See you next week!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you then!
