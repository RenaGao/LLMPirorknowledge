**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! How’s it going?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello! I am fine, thank you. And you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good, thanks. I was wondering, do you have any plans for this weekend?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, no plan yet. Maybe... um, spend time with family?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice. How about a picnic? The weather is supposed to be great.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Picnic? Yes, good idea! But... where we can go?  

**Speaker A (NS):** There’s a park near the river. It’s quiet and has lots of shade.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I know that place. I think it is... um, good for picnic.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! What kind of food should we bring?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe... sushi? Or, um... sandwiches? And also drink.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sushi and sandwiches sound great. I’ll bring some snacks and drinks too.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you. Also, my family can bring... um, fruit and tea.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great addition. What time should we meet?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... maybe 11 o’clock? Is okay?  

**Speaker A (NS):** 11 works for me. Should we meet at the park entrance?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, park entrance. I will... um, make map for my family.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. I’m looking forward to it!  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Me too. Thank you for organizing.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! See you this weekend then.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you! Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Sora! Have a great day!
