**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Yuki, do you have a moment? I wanted to ask about the homework assignment.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I... I have question too. About page three, what is meaning of "analyze the data"?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, good question. It means you need to look at the data carefully and explain what it shows. Do you have the data set ready?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I have. But... um, how to say... I not sure what is important part.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay. Let’s break it down. First, look for patterns—like numbers that go up or down. Do you see any trends?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I think... yes, in January, the number is high, but in March, it is... low.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great observation! That’s a trend. Now, can you think of why that might happen?  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe... um, because of weather? January is cold, so people stay at home?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good theory! You can include that in your analysis.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I understand. Thank you! But, uh, how many sentence I need to write?  

**Speaker A (NS):** About three to four sentences per trend should be enough. Don’t make it too complicated.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, three sentence. I will try.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re doing great, Yuki. Let me know if you have more questions.  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you for help.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Good luck with the assignment!  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I will work hard. Have a good day!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Yuki. See you in class tomorrow!  

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you tomorrow. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye for now!
