**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kana! It’s great to meet you. Do you have time to talk about dining etiquette in our cultures?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, hello! Thank you for ask. It is... interesting topic. I have time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful! Let’s start. In Japan, what’s considered polite when eating?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** In Japan, we say "itadakimasu" before eat. It means... um, gratefulness for food. Also, we use chopsticks, and is not good to put chopsticks in rice straight.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fascinating. In the U.S., saying "thank you" before a meal isn’t as common. But we do use forks and knives. What’s something unexpected in Japanese dining?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm... maybe... slurping noodles? In Japan, it is okay, but I heard in U.S., it is not polite?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s right. Slurping here is seen as impolite. What about sharing food?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sharing food... in Japan, we have small plate for share. But we not use our own... um, chopsticks to take food. It is... how to say... bad impression.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Here, we often share directly from the same plate, but it depends on the situation. Is there anything you find surprising about U.S. dining?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... yes. In U.S., people sometimes eat with hand, like pizza or sandwich. In Japan, we always use chopsticks or fork. And... also, tipping. Japanese restaurant not need tip, but U.S. is need tip, right?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true. Tipping here is expected, but it’s different in Japan. It’s interesting how dining customs vary, isn’t it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, very interesting! I learn many new thing today.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Thanks for sharing. It’s been great talking to you.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you also. It was nice... um, nice talking with you. Have a good day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Let’s chat again soon. Goodbye!
