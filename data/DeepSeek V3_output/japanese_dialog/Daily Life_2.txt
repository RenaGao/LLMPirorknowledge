**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m thinking of cooking dinner tonight. Do you have a favorite meal?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I like... um, how to say... Japanese curry. It is very comfort food for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Japanese curry? That sounds delicious! How do you make it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** First, you need onion, carrot, potato, and... um, meat. I use pork, but chicken is also okay.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Do you chop the vegetables?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I cut them into small piece... pieces. Then, I fry meat in the pan until it is... um, brown color.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. What’s next?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** After that, I add vegetable and fry together. Then, I put water and... um, curry roux.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Curry roux?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is like... block of curry flavor. You can buy it in Japanese store.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. How long does it take to cook?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** About... 30 minutes? You wait until vegetable is soft and sauce is thick.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s not too long. Do you serve it with anything?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, usually with rice. It is very good combination.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll have to try it sometime! Maybe you can teach me how to make it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Of course! I can show you next time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great. Thanks for sharing!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You’re welcome! I’m happy to talk about it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I’m excited to learn more about Japanese cooking. See you later!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** See you later!
