Here’s a realistic conversation based on the topic:

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yumi! I heard you recently visited the U.S. How was your trip?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, it was good! But... um, I noticed some, how to say... different ways of eating? In Japan, it’s very different.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, really? Like what?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Uh, in Japan, we use chopsticks mostly. But in U.S., fork and knife is common. It was little... strange for me at first.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! Did you get used to it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, but I still make mistake. Like, sometimes I drop food with fork. It feels... not natural.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, don’t worry! It takes practice. What else felt different?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** In Japan, we share food sometimes. Like, small dishes in middle of table. But in U.S., everyone has... um, their own plate.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s true! Sharing food is more common here in family-style restaurants, though.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. Also, in Japan, we say “itadakimasu” before eating. It means... um, “I receive this food.” But in U.S., people don’t say anything.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a big difference! We usually say “Bon appetit” in fancy places, but it’s not as common.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, and after eating in Japan, we say “gochisousama.” It’s like... thanking for the meal.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice! It’s kind of like our habit of saying “thank you” to the server after the meal.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, maybe! But in Japan, we say it to the cook or... um, the person who made the food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great tradition. It’s nice to show appreciation.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I think so. Also, in U.S., people drink cold water with meal. In Japan, we drink hot tea or... um, warm water.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I didn’t know that! I guess it’s all about personal preference here.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it was interesting to see. I learned a lot.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Thanks for sharing. We’ll have to try Japanese dining together sometime.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! That would be fun. Let’s do it!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! See you soon, Yumi.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you soon!
