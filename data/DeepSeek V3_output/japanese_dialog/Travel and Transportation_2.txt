**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! I heard you’re thinking about planning a group vacation. Do you have any ideas?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I think maybe… um, Hawaii? Or perhaps, how to say… nature place? Like mountains?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, both sound great! Do you think the group would prefer beaches or hiking?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm… maybe beach? Because Hawaii is, uh, warm and good for relax. Also, swimming is fun.  
**Speaker A (NS):** True, Hawaii is perfect for that. Do you know if anyone in the group has been there before?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I think Tomo and… um, Ayaka? They go last year. They say it is very beautiful and… um, delicious food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s good to hear! What kind of activities should we plan? Maybe surfing or island tours?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, surfing is… um, famous in Hawaii. Also, I think we can visit volcano. It is… um, close to our hotel?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, there’s a volcano park not too far. We could rent a car to get there. What about the budget? Should we check flight prices first?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, budget is… important. Maybe we can share cost for hotel? Flight is… um, I don’t know how much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll check flight prices tonight and share it with the group. How many days should we go for?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think… five or six days? Not too long, but enough to enjoy. Is it… okay?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. We’ll have time to relax and explore. Should we set a date next month?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, next month is good. Maybe… third week? I can ask group about this.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea. Let me know what everyone thinks. Oh, and we should also figure out who’s booking the flights and hotel.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I can… um, take care of hotel. Maybe you can do flight?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’ll handle the flights. This is going to be such a fun trip!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I am… um, excited! Thank you for helping.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let’s confirm everything with the group tomorrow.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay! See you tomorrow. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Yuki! Let’s make this trip amazing.
