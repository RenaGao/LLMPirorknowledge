**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Could you tell me about your usual morning routine?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I wake up at, um... 7 o'clock. Then... I drink water and do... stretching?
**Speaker A (NS):** Stretching? That’s great! How long do you stretch for?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe... 10 minute? It is good for body.
**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. What do you do after that?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Then I take shower. After, I eat breakfast. Usually bread and eggs.
**Speaker A (NS):** Simple and healthy! Do you drink coffee or tea in the morning?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I like green tea. It is... um, how to say... calming for me.
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice. What about getting ready for work or school?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** After breakfast, I prepare bag and, um... wear clothes. Then I go to office by train.
**Speaker A (NS):** Do you leave at the same time every day?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, usually 8:30. Sometimes... traffic is bad, so I leave early.
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Sounds like a solid routine!
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. And you? What is your morning... routine?
**Speaker A (NS):** I wake up a bit later, around 7:30. I usually go for a short run, then have breakfast. I also drink coffee to wake me up.
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Running is good! But I cannot run in morning. I feel... too sleepy.
**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I get that. It’s not for everyone. Thanks for sharing your routine!
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you too. It was nice talking with you.
**Speaker A (NS):** Same here! Have a great day.
