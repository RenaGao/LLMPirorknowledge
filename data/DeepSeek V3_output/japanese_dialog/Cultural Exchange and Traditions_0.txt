**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aki! I heard you’re from Japan. Can you tell me about a festival or tradition from your culture?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! In Japan, we have... um... festival called "Obon." It is very important.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Obon? What’s it about?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It is time when... um, how to say... we remember family member who passed away.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So it’s like honoring ancestors?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, exactly! We go to family grave and clean it. And we make... um, food offering.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds meaningful. Do you do anything special at home?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we light lantern and put it outside house. It is to guide... um, spirits.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s beautiful. Is there any dancing or music?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, yes! There is dance called "Bon Odori." People wear yukata and dance in circle.  
**Speaker A (NS):** A yukata? Is that a type of clothing?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is like... um, light kimono. Very comfortable for summer.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Do people eat special food during Obon?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we eat... um, somen noodle. It is thin and cold. Very refreshing.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Cold noodles in summer—perfect! When does Obon usually happen?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It depends on region. In my area, it is in August, around... um, middle of month.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, so it’s coming up soon! Do you celebrate it every year?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I go to hometown every year. It is very important time for family.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful, Aki. Thank you for sharing!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you for listening. I hope... um, one day you can see Obon in Japan.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to! Thanks again, Aki. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! See you again soon!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, and good luck with your English practice!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I will do my best. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
