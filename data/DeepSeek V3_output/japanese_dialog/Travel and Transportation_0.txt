**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! How have you been? I heard you went on a trip recently. How was it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I go to Osaka last week. It was very... how to say... exciting?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! What did you do there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I visit Osaka Castle, and also... Dotonbori. It is famous street, many food and light.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Dotonbori is amazing! Did you try any local food?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, yes! I eat takoyaki. It is... um, ball with octopus. Very delicious!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Takoyaki is my favorite! Did you like the atmosphere there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! It was very lively. Many people, and the light is very bright. But... um, a little noisy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I can imagine. Did you visit any other places?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I go to... um, aquarium. It has big whale shark. Very impressive.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Kaiyukan Aquarium, right? That’s such a cool place. How long did you stay in Osaka?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I stay for three day. It was enough, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Did you use public transportation to get around?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I use subway many time. It is... um, easy to understand, but a little crowded.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Did you find any souvenirs to bring back?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I buy... um, thing for cooking. Okonomiyaki sauce. It is special in Osaka.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s a great souvenir! Did you enjoy your trip overall?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I enjoy very much! Osaka is... um, very interesting city. I want to go again.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear! I’d love to visit Osaka too someday. Thanks for sharing your experience, Yuki!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you for listening! Next time, I tell you more about my trip.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! Have a great day, Yuki!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! Goodbye!
