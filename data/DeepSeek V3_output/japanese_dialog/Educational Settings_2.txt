**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kazuki! Thanks for helping me with this math problem. I’m really stuck. Can you explain it to me?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, I can try. This problem is about… um, how to say… area of… triangle?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the area of a triangle. I know the formula, but I’m not sure how to apply it here.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, formula is… um, one-half times base times height. You need to find base first.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Right, but how do I find the height if it’s not given?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. This triangle is… um, right triangle. So, height is same as one side.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see! So the height is just this side here?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, yes. And base is… this side. So you can calculate now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. So, area equals one-half times base times height. Should I calculate it now?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, please try. I will check your answer.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I got 24 square units. Is that correct?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, very good! You understand now?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, thanks to you! Your explanation really helped.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I am glad. Um, if you have more question, please ask.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I will. You’re really good at explaining things.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I try my best.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I think I’m good for now. Thank you so much, Kazuki!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You’re welcome. See you next time!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you!
