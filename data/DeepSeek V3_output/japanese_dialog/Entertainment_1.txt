**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! Do you have any plans for this evening?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! No, I not have plan yet. Why you ask?
**Speaker A (NS):** I was wondering if you’d like to go out for dinner. Maybe try that new Italian place?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Italian food? That sound good. But I not sure... is it expensive?
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s a bit pricey, but the reviews are excellent. What’s your budget like?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I think... maybe not too much expensive. Perhaps we can find cheaper place?
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. How about the sushi place downtown? It’s affordable and really fresh.
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, sushi! Yes, I like that. It is feel more... um, comfortable for me.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Sushi it is. Do you want to do anything after dinner? Maybe catch a movie?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Movie is good idea. But... what time is dinner?
**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s say 7 p.m. That gives us time to eat and still make a late showing.
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. But I think movie is too late for me. Maybe we can... um... walk in park instead?
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice idea! The park is beautiful in the evening. Let’s do that.
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I like that plan. Sushi and walk in park is... um, very relaxing.
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Should I pick you up, or do you want to meet at the restaurant?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Let’s meet there. I can... um... take bus to sushi place.
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. I’ll see you at 7 p.m. then!
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you at seven. Thank you for making plan with me!
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I’m looking forward to it. Have a great day until then.
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too. Goodbye!
