**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Rina! We need to plan our team meeting for next week. Do you have any ideas for the agenda?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I think we can talk about... um, the new project? And also maybe... the budget?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good start. The new project and budget are important. Anything else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... how to say... maybe we discuss the… team training? It is, um, necessary, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Team training is a great point. We should definitely include that. What time do you think we should set?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe... 10 o’clock? Is it good for everyone?  
**Speaker A (NS):** 10 a.m. works for me. I’ll check with the others too. Where should we meet?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We can use the meeting room... um, Room 3? It is big enough.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Room 3 sounds perfect. How long should the meeting be?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe one hour? Or two? If we have many topic.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s plan for two hours, just in case. Do you want to prepare a presentation for the new project?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I can. But I need some help with the... um, data analysis part.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. I’ll assist you with that. Let’s meet one day before to go over it together.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! That is helpful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Is there anything else we should add to the agenda?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... I think no. The agenda is... complete, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Let’s finalize it then: new project, budget, and team training. Meeting at 10 a.m. in Room 3 for two hours. Does that sound good?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is good. Thank you for your help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I’ll send out an email to the team with all the details. See you at the meeting!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, see you next week! Have a nice day.
