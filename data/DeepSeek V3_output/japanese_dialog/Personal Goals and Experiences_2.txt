**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It’s nice to meet you. What’s a skill you’d like to learn?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! I want to... um, learn cooking. Because, um... how to say... I live alone now, so need to make food myself.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great skill! What kind of cooking are you interested in?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like Japanese food, but also want to try... um, Western style. Maybe Italian?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Italian sounds delicious! Are there any dishes you’d like to start with?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to make pasta. But, um... I don’t know how to make sauce. It’s... difficult for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Pasta sauce isn’t too hard once you practice. Have you thought about taking a cooking class?  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I saw one class near my home. But, um... it’s in English. I’m not sure if I can understand everything.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s understandable. But it could be a great way to improve both your cooking and English skills!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe... yes, I think I will try. It’s important for me to learn because, um... I want to be more independent.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a wonderful goal. Cooking is a great way to take care of yourself and impress others too!  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! Also, my friends like to eat together. If I cook, they will be happy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure they will! Cooking together can be a lot of fun.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you for encouraging me. I will try the class next week!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Good luck, and let me know how it goes.  
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will! Thank you and goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day!
