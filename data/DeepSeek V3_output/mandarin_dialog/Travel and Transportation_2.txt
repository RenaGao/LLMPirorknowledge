**Speaker A:** That’s a nice idea. Which beach location are you thinking of?  

**Speaker B:** Hmm... maybe Thailand? I hear Phuket is very beautiful.  

**Speaker A:** Phuket sounds great! What kind of activities do you want to do there?  

**Speaker B:** Oh, maybe we can swim, or... um, how to say... take small boat for see island?  

**Speaker A:** Oh, like island hopping?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes! Island hopping. And also... maybe eat seafood. Thai food is very delicious.  

**Speaker A:** I love Thai food too. Do you think we should book a hotel or stay in a resort?  

**Speaker B:** Resort is better, I think. More comfortable, and have... um, activity like swimming pool and spa.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a good point. How long should we stay? A week?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, one week is good. Not too long, not too short.  

**Speaker A:** Perfect. What about transportation? Should we rent a car, or can we use taxis?  

**Speaker B:** Taxi is okay, I think. Or maybe... um, tuk-tuk? It is fun!  

**Speaker A:** Ha, yes, tuk-tuks are fun and convenient. Should we plan to visit any specific places?  

**Speaker B:** Oh, yes! I think... Buddha temple is important to see. And maybe... night market for shopping.  

**Speaker A:** Great suggestions. Let’s include those in our itinerary.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, and also... um, how to say... take photo with elephant?  

**Speaker A:** Oh, like an elephant sanctuary?  

**Speaker B:** Yes! Elephant sanctuary. I want to see them very much.  

**Speaker A:** Me too. Let’s plan that as a highlight.  

**Speaker B:** Okay, I think this plan is... very good.
