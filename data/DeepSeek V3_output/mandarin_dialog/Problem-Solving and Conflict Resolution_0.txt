**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, I noticed you seemed upset earlier. Did I do something wrong?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Um... yes, I feel maybe you forget my... my birthday yesterday? I wait for you say "happy birthday," but you no say.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no! I’m so sorry. I didn’t forget; I just thought your birthday was next week. I even bought a present for you.  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Ah, really? I think you forget because you no message me. I feel... how to say... a little sad.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I completely understand why you’d feel that way. I should have double-checked the date. I’m really sorry for the misunderstanding.  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** It’s okay. I now know you no forget. You have present for me? What is it?  

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s a book you mentioned wanting to read. I thought you’d like it.  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Oh! You remember that? I feel very happy now. Thank you so much.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I’m glad we could clear this up. Do you want to meet tomorrow and I’ll give it to you?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, that is good idea. But, um... where we meet?  

**Speaker A (NS):** How about that café near the park? The one we went to last time?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Ah, yes, I remember. The place with good coffee. Okay, what time?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Does 3 p.m. work for you?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, 3 p.m. is good. I will see you then.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’m glad we talked about this. See you tomorrow!  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, see you tomorrow. And thank you for... um, understanding my feelings.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! That’s what friends are for. Take care!  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** You too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! We both feel much better after talking.
