**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Li Wei! How’s it going? Are you ready for the exam next week?  
**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Ah, yes. I am... um, working hard. But I feel a little... how to say... nervous?  

**Speaker A:** That’s totally normal. What’s the hardest part for you?  
**Speaker B:** For me, the writing part is difficult. I understand the question, but my words... uh, my grammar is not so good.  

**Speaker A:** I get that. Have you practiced writing essays?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, I try. I write two essays, but I not sure if it is correct. Maybe you can... um, check for me?  

**Speaker A:** Of course! I’d be happy to help. What about the other parts of the exam?  
**Speaker B:** Listening is okay, but sometimes I miss the word. And speaking... um, I need more practice.  

**Speaker A:** That makes sense. Maybe we can do a mock speaking test together?  
**Speaker B:** That is good idea! When you have time?  

**Speaker A:** How about tomorrow after class? We can meet in the library.  
**Speaker B:** Yes, good. Tomorrow after class. I will bring my notebook.  

**Speaker A:** Perfect! And don’t forget to review the key vocabulary. It really helps.  
**Speaker B:** Yes, I will. I already make list of words. But some words I... um, forget the meaning.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a great start. Just keep practicing, and you’ll do fine.  
**Speaker B:** Thank you. You are very helpful. I feel a little better now.  

**Speaker A:** No problem at all! We’ve got this. Let’s do our best and ace this exam.  
**Speaker B:** Yes, we will do our best! See you tomorrow then.  

**Speaker A:** See you tomorrow, Li Wei! Good luck with your studies today.  
**Speaker B:** Thank you, and you too! Goodbye!  

**Speaker A:** Bye!
