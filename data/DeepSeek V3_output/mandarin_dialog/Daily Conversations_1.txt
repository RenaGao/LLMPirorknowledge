**Speaker A:** Hi there! Thanks for chatting with me today. Can you tell me about your favorite hobby?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes! My favorite hobby is... um, how to say... taking pictures with camera.

**Speaker A:** Oh, photography! That’s a great hobby. What do you like to take pictures of?

**Speaker B:** I like to take picture of, um, nature. Like trees, flowers, and sometimes... how to say... big places, like mountains.

**Speaker A:** Landscapes?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, landscapes. I go to park or... um, countryside to take picture.

**Speaker A:** That sounds relaxing. Why do you enjoy photography?

**Speaker B:** I think it is, um, good way to... how to say... keep memory. Also, it make me feel happy when I see... uh, what is the word... beautiful things.

**Speaker A:** "Beautiful things"—that makes sense. Do you have a favorite photo you’ve taken?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I have one. It is... um, picture of sunset in my hometown. The sky has many colors, like red, orange, and... yellow.

**Speaker A:** That sounds stunning! Do you edit your photos, or do you keep them natural?

**Speaker B:** I try to keep them natural. But sometimes I use, um, phone app to make colors more... clear.

**Speaker A:** That’s a good approach. Do you share your photos with others?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I share with my friends and family. They say it is very nice. And I also put them on, um, social media.

**Speaker A:** That’s wonderful. I’m sure they enjoy seeing your work. Do you have any plans for photography in the future?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I want to buy better camera and learn... um, more skill. Maybe travel to new places to take picture.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a great plan. I hope you get to do that soon.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. I think it will be very fun.

**Speaker A:** It definitely will. Thanks for sharing your hobby with me. It was great talking to you!

**Speaker B:** Thank you too. I enjoy talking about my hobby. Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Take care! Goodbye!
