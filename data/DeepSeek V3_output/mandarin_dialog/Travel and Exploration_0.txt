**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I heard you and some friends are planning a trip. Where are you thinking of going?  
**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Ah, yes! We want to go... um, how to say... big city. Maybe New York?  

**Speaker A:** New York sounds exciting! What do you want to do there?  
**Speaker B:** We want to see famous place, like... Statue of Liberty. And also, shopping, and eat food.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a great plan. Have you thought about where you’ll stay?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, but... um, it is difficult. Hotels are very expensive. Maybe we stay in... um... sharing place?  

**Speaker A:** Oh, you mean an Airbnb?  
**Speaker B:** Yes! Airbnb. It is cheaper and... uh, more comfortable for group.  

**Speaker A:** Good idea. Have you looked at transportation?  
**Speaker B:** Transportation? Ah, yes. We think take train to New York. And in city, we use... um... subway.  

**Speaker A:** The subway is a great way to get around. Do you know how long you’ll stay?  
**Speaker B:** We think three days. Is it enough?  

**Speaker A:** Three days is good for a first trip. You’ll have time to see the main attractions.  
**Speaker B:** That’s good. But we are worry about... um, budget.  

**Speaker A:** Budget can be tricky. Maybe prioritize the things you really want to do.  
**Speaker B:** Yes, we will make list. Like... Statue of Liberty first, then shopping, then... um, famous museum.  

**Speaker A:** The Metropolitan Museum?  
**Speaker B:** Yes! That one. Thank you for help.  

**Speaker A:** No problem. When are you planning to go?  
**Speaker B:** We think... um, next month. In October.  

**Speaker A:** October is a great time to visit. The weather should be nice.  
**Speaker B:** Yes, we hope so. Thank you for advice.  

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Let me know if you need more help.  
**Speaker B:** I will. Thank you! We will plan more and tell you.  

**Speaker A:** Sounds good. Have a great trip!  
**Speaker B:** Thank you! We are very excited. Bye!  

**Speaker A:** Bye!  

(The conversation ends with both speakers expressing gratitude and summarizing their next steps.)
