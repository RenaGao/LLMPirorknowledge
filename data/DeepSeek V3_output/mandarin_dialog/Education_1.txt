**Speaker A:** Hi, I’m trying to understand this topic about climate change. Can you help me?  
**Speaker B:** Oh, climate change, yes. I can try. Climate change is... how to say... the Earth temperature is increasing? Because of many things like... um, pollution and too much CO2.  

**Speaker A:** That’s right. So, can you explain what CO2 is?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, CO2 is... ah, carbon dioxide. It is gas. When we use car or factory, it makes CO2. It trap heat in the air, so Earth become warmer.  

**Speaker A:** Got it. How does this affect the environment?  
**Speaker B:** Affect many ways. Ice in North and South Pole is melting. Sea level is rising. And weather is... um, strange. More storm and flood.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a good summary. How can we help reduce climate change?  
**Speaker B:** We can use less energy. For example, turn off light when not use. And maybe... use bus or bicycle instead of car. Also, plant more trees.  

**Speaker A:** Those are great suggestions! Do you think governments should do more?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, I think government need make policy to stop pollution. Like... um, give money for clean energy or stop using coal.  

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. Thanks for explaining this so clearly.  
**Speaker B:** You’re welcome! I hope it help you understand better.  

**Speaker A:** It did. I’ll share these ideas with our study group.  
**Speaker B:** Good idea. Let’s talk more next time. Bye!  

**Speaker A:** Bye, take care!
