**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Do you like reading books?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, I like reading. But I... how to say... not have much time recently.

**Speaker A:** I understand. If you had to recommend one book, what would it be?

**Speaker B:** Ah, I think... "The Little Prince." It is very famous in my country.

**Speaker A:** Oh, "The Little Prince"? I’ve heard of it! Why do you recommend it?

**Speaker B:** Because... um, it is not only for children. It talks about... how to say... important things in life. Like love, friendship.

**Speaker A:** That sounds meaningful. Is it easy to read?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is easy. The language is simple, but the meaning is deep. I read it in Chinese first, then in English.

**Speaker A:** That’s a good tip! Did you learn anything from it?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. It teach me to... um, appreciate the small things. Like the flower, the stars. It is very... how to say... touching.

**Speaker A:** That’s beautiful. I think I’ll give it a try. Do you have a favorite part?

**Speaker B:** Oh, yes. My favorite part is when the fox says... "What is important is invisible to the eye." It is very... um... thoughtful.

**Speaker A:** That’s such a powerful quote. I’ll definitely remember that. Thanks for recommending it!

**Speaker B:** You’re welcome. I think you will like it. It is... um... good for the heart.

**Speaker A:** I’m sure it is. It was great talking to you about this!

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you for listening. I hope you enjoy the book!

**Speaker A:** I’ll let you know when I finish it. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** You too! See you later!
