**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How can I help you today?  
**Speaker B (L2):** Hello. I am looking for... um, thing for cleaning glass.  

**Speaker A:** You mean glass cleaner?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, glass cleaner. Do you have it in store?  

**Speaker A:** Absolutely! It’s in the cleaning supplies aisle. Follow me, I’ll show you.  
**Speaker B:** Thank you. I already check... uh, I checked there, but I cannot find.  

**Speaker A:** No problem. Let’s take another look. Here we are—this is our glass cleaner.  
**Speaker B:** Ah, this one! I see now. Thank you so much.  

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Do you need just one bottle, or…?  
**Speaker B:** I think one is enough for now. How much it costs?  

**Speaker A:** It’s $3.99.  
**Speaker B:** Okay, I will take it. Do you have, um, thing for paper fixing?  

**Speaker A:** Do you mean a stapler?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, stapler! I forget the name.  

**Speaker A:** No worries. Staplers are in the office supplies aisle. Let’s walk over there.  
**Speaker B:** Thank you. You are very helpful.  

**Speaker A:** My pleasure. Here we go—this is the stapler section. Do you see one you like?  
**Speaker B:** This one is good. How much is this?  

**Speaker A:** This one is $7.49.  
**Speaker B:** Okay, I will take it too.  

**Speaker A:** Great! Is there anything else you need?  
**Speaker B:** No, thank you. You help me a lot.  

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! I’m glad I could help. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B:** Thank you. You too! Goodbye.  

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! See you next time.
