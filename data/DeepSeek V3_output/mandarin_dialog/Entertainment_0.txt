**Speaker A:** Hey! Have you seen any good movies or TV shows lately?  

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes! I watch... um, one TV show called "Game of Thrones." It is very famous, I think.  

**Speaker A:** Oh, I’ve heard of it! What do you like about it?  

**Speaker B:** I like the story and the... how to say... the characters. They are very strong and interesting.  

**Speaker A:** That’s great! Did you finish watching it?  

**Speaker B:** No, not yet. I am on season... um, season four. The part where, um... the king dies.  

**Speaker A:** Oh, that’s a big moment. You’re in for a lot more surprises!  

**Speaker B:** Really? I am excited to see. Do you have any other... um, recommendation?  

**Speaker A:** Sure! Have you tried "Stranger Things"? It’s a mix of sci-fi and mystery.  

**Speaker B:** "Stranger Things"? I hear this name before. Is it... scary?  

**Speaker A:** A little, but not too much. It’s more about friendship and adventure.  

**Speaker B:** Oh, that sounds good. I will try it. Thank you for telling me.  

**Speaker A:** No problem! What about movies? Do you have a favorite?  

**Speaker B:** My favorite movie is... "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." I watch it many times.  

**Speaker A:** Oh, that’s a classic! The action scenes are amazing.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, and the music, the... how to say... the feeling is very beautiful.  

**Speaker A:** I agree. It’s a really artistic film.  

**Speaker B:** Do you like Chinese movies?  

**Speaker A:** I’ve seen a few, but not many. Do you have any other recommendations?  

**Speaker B:** You can try "The Farewell." It is very... touching.  

**Speaker A:** I’ll check it out! Thanks for the suggestion.  

**Speaker B:** You’re welcome. It’s nice to talk about movies.  

**Speaker A:** Me too! Let’s do this again sometime.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I agree. See you next time!  

**Speaker A:** See you!
