**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me about a tradition or festival from your country?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Ah, yes! In my country, we have... um, Mid-Autumn Festival. It is very important and family time.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds interesting! When does it happen?  

**Speaker B:** It is in... um, eighth month, fifteenth day, lunar calendar. So, every year date is different.  

**Speaker A:** Oh, I see. What do people do during this festival?  

**Speaker B:** We eat mooncake—it’s kind of, um, small round cake with sweet inside. And also, we watch moon together because it’s very big and bright.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds lovely! Why is the moon so important?  

**Speaker B:** Moon mean... uh, how to say... reunion. Family come together, like moon is full and round.  

**Speaker A:** That’s such a beautiful meaning! Do people give gifts during this festival?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, we give mooncake to friends and family. It is... um, traditional way to show love and thanks.  

**Speaker A:** That’s so thoughtful. Are there any special activities for children?  

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes! Children play with lanterns. They make it with paper and light inside. It’s very colorful and fun.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you celebrate this festival every year?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, every year. It is my favorite festival because I can see all my family and eat mooncake.  

**Speaker A:** I’d love to experience it one day. It sounds so meaningful.  

**Speaker B:** You should come! I can bring mooncake for you to try.  

**Speaker A:** That would be amazing! Thank you for explaining it so well.  

**Speaker B:** You are welcome! I’m happy you like it.  

**Speaker A:** This was such a nice conversation. Thanks again, and have a great day!  

**Speaker B:** Thank you! You too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! See you next time.
