**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! How have you been lately?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Ah, hello! I am good, but... um, I feel little tired these days.  

**Speaker A:** Oh no, that’s not good. What do you think is making you feel tired?  

**Speaker B:** Maybe... because I sleep late. And I eat too much... um, how to say... not healthy food.  

**Speaker A:** Junk food? Fried or sugary things?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes! Junk food. I like it very much, but I know it is not good for health.  

**Speaker A:** I see. Have you thought about making small changes to feel better?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I think so. I want to... um... eat more vegetables and fruit. But... how to keep doing it?  

**Speaker A:** Good start! Maybe you can plan your meals in advance. And, um, try to cook at home more often.  

**Speaker B:** Cooking at home... yes, it sounds good. But I am not very good at cooking.  

**Speaker A:** That’s okay! You can start with simple recipes. There are many easy ones online.  

**Speaker B:** Oh, good idea. I will try. And... um, I also think I need to exercise.  

**Speaker A:** Definitely! Even a short walk every day can help. Do you have time in the morning or evening?  

**Speaker B:** I think I can walk in the evening. After work, I feel... um... too much sitting.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a great plan. Walking is a simple way to stay active.  

**Speaker B:** Yes. And maybe I will drink more water. I always forget.  

**Speaker A:** Oh, that’s important! Maybe you can set reminders on your phone.  

**Speaker B:** Ah, good idea! I will do that.  

**Speaker A:** It sounds like you have a good plan now—eating better, walking, and drinking water.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you for your advice. I feel more... um... confident to start.  

**Speaker A:** That’s great to hear! Let me know how it goes.  

**Speaker B:** I will! Thank you so much. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Take care, and I’ll talk to you soon.  

**Speaker B:** Okay, see you later!  

**Speaker A:** See you!
