**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Do you need help with something? You look a bit lost.  

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Oh, yes, thank you. I... um, try to find hotel. Do you know where is it?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! There are a few hotels nearby. Which one are you looking for?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** The name is... um... Sunshine Hotel?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Sunshine Hotel! That’s a good one. It’s not far from here. Do you know how to walk or take a bus?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** I prefer walking. It is not too far, right?  

**Speaker A (NS):** No, it’s about 10 minutes on foot. You go straight down this road, then turn left at the second traffic light.  

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Go straight... then turn left at second light, yes?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! After you turn left, you’ll see a big park. The hotel is just across the park.  

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Oh, park! That is easy. Thank you so much!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Do you need help with anything else?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** No, no, I think I can find it now. Thank you again.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Have a great stay at the hotel!  

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Yes, thank you! You are very kind. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care!  

*The conversation ends with friendly goodbyes, and the L2 speaker successfully receives directions to the hotel.*
