**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, welcome to the apartment! I was wondering, what’s your favorite meal to cook?  
**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Hello! Thank you. My favorite meal is... um, how to say... Chinese dumplings. I like to make it.  
**Speaker A:** Oh, dumplings! That’s great. Do you make them from scratch?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, I make from the start. I use... um, flour and water for the... outside. And inside, I put pork and cabbage.  
**Speaker A:** That sounds delicious. How do you prepare the filling?  
**Speaker B:** First, I cut... um, chop the cabbage and mix with pork. Then I add salt, sugar, and... um, a little oil. It is very simple.  
**Speaker A:** Got it. And how do you make the dough?  
**Speaker B:** I mix flour and water until... it become soft. Then I roll it into small... um, circles. It is a bit difficult, but I practice many times.  
**Speaker A:** That’s cool. Do you boil or fry the dumplings?  
**Speaker B:** Usually I boil them, but sometimes I fry. Fried dumplings are more crispy, but boiled is more... traditional.  
**Speaker A:** Makes sense. Do you often make dumplings for friends or family?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, my family love it. When we have holiday, we all make dumplings together. It is very fun.  
**Speaker A:** That sounds like a great tradition. Maybe you can teach me how to make them sometime!  
**Speaker B:** Oh, yes! I can show you. It is not too hard. Maybe next weekend?  
**Speaker A:** Sure, next weekend works for me. I’m excited to learn!  
**Speaker B:** Okay, I will prepare things for it. It will be fun!  
**Speaker A:** Awesome. Thanks for sharing—I’m looking forward to it!  
**Speaker B:** You’re welcome. I’m happy you like it too. See you then!  
**Speaker A:** See you! Have a great day!  
**Speaker B:** Thank you, you too! Goodbye!  
**Speaker A:** Goodbye, and welcome
