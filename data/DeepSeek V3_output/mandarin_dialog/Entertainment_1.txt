**Speaker A:** Hey Li Na, do you have any plans for this evening?  

**Speaker B:** Ah, no plans yet. I think... um, maybe we can... go out?  

**Speaker A:** Sure! Any ideas on what you’d like to do?  

**Speaker B:** Hmm, maybe eat dinner? But I don’t know good place.  

**Speaker A:** How about trying that new Italian restaurant downtown?  

**Speaker B:** Italian food? I like it! But... is it expensive?  

**Speaker A:** It’s a bit pricey, but the reviews are great. We can split the cost if you’re okay with that.  

**Speaker B:** Good idea. After dinner, can we go walk in park? I feel... um, is nice to relax.  

**Speaker A:** The park sounds lovely. There’s also a new ice cream shop nearby.  

**Speaker B:** Ice cream? Yes! I like ice cream very much.  

**Speaker A:** Perfect! So, dinner at the Italian restaurant, then a walk in the park, and ice cream to finish the evening.  

**Speaker B:** Um, what time we meet?  

**Speaker A:** How about 6:30 at the restaurant?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, 6:30 is okay. Oh, but... what is address?  

**Speaker A:** I’ll text you the address. Don’t worry!  

**Speaker B:** Thank you! You are... very helpful.  

**Speaker A:** No problem. I’m looking forward to this evening!  

**Speaker B:** Me too. I feel... excited!  

**Speaker A:** Great! See you at 6:30 then.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, see you later!  

**Speaker A:** Bye, Li Na!  

**Speaker B:** Bye! Have a good day until then.
