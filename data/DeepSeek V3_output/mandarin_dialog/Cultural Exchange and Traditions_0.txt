**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! How’s everything going?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing great, thanks. I was wondering, could you tell me about a tradition or festival from your culture?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Ah, yes! My favorite is Spring Festival. It is... um, very important in China.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s the Chinese New Year, right?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, exactly! We call it Chun Jie. It is time for family to... um, come together.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice. What do people usually do during the festival?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** We eat big dinner, um, how to say... reunion dinner. And we give red envelope with money inside. It is called... hongbao.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of that! Do you also decorate your homes?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes! We put red things everywhere. Red is... um, lucky color. We write words on red paper and stick them on door.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so interesting. Do you have any special foods for the festival?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Ah, yes! We eat dumplings. It means... um, good luck and money for next year.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I love dumplings! Do you make them yourself?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, my family make together. It is fun, but sometime it is difficult to make nice shape.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I can imagine! It sounds like a wonderful celebration.  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, it is very happy time. I miss it when I am not in China.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I can understand that. Traditions like that are so special. Thanks for sharing!  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** You are welcome! Maybe one day you can see Spring Festival in China.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Thanks again for explaining everything so well.  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Thank you for asking! It was nice to talk about it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. Have a great day, Xiao Li!  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** You too! Goodbye!
