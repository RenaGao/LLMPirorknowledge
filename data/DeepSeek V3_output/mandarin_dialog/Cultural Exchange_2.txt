**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I heard you’re from China. Can I ask what your favorite holiday is there?  

**Speaker B (L2):** Ah, yes. My favorite holiday is, um… Spring Festival. Is biggest festival in China.  

**Speaker A:** Oh, Spring Festival! Is that the same as Lunar New Year?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, Lunar New Year. We say “Chun Jie” in Chinese. It’s very… um, important for family.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds amazing. What do you usually do during Spring Festival?  

**Speaker B:** We have big dinner with family. And, um, we give… red envelope to children. Has money inside.  

**Speaker A:** Red envelopes with money? That’s so interesting! Do you have any special food during the festival?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, we eat dumpling. It’s called “jiaozi.” Means… um, good luck for new year.  

**Speaker A:** I’ve heard of dumplings! Do you make them at home?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, we make together. Whole family. It’s… um, very happy time.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds wonderful. Do you also decorate your house for Spring Festival?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, we have red… um, paper on door. Write good words. Like “happiness” or “health.”  

**Speaker A:** That’s beautiful. I’d love to experience Spring Festival someday. Thank you for sharing!  

**Speaker B:** You are welcome. Maybe you can visit China in Spring Festival.  

**Speaker A:** I’d love to! Thanks again. Have a great day!  

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you! You too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A:** Goodbye!
