**Speaker A:** Hey, Li Wei! I was wondering if you’re free this weekend. We’re planning a surprise party for Mei Ling.  

**Speaker B:** Ah, surprise party? Yes, I am free. That sounds very exciting! What is the plan?  

**Speaker A:** Great! We’re thinking of hosting it at her favorite café. Do you think that’s a good idea?  

**Speaker B:** Oh, café is good place. She likes it very much. But, um... will it be… how to say… too open? Maybe she will see us before surprise.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a good point. How about we rent a private room there? It’s more hidden, and she won’t suspect anything.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, private room is better idea. How many people will come?  

**Speaker A:** We’re inviting about 10 people. Do you think that’s enough?  

**Speaker B:** Um, 10 is good number. Not too big, not too small. But, uh, we need to make decoration, right?  

**Speaker A:** Definitely! We’ll need balloons, banners, and maybe some flowers. Can you help with that?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can help. I know place to buy decoration. It’s near my house. Also, I can make... um... food? Or cake?  

**Speaker A:** That’d be amazing! If you can bring a cake, that would take a lot of pressure off me. Do you know her favorite flavor?  

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. She likes chocolate. I will buy chocolate cake. But, um… how we get her to come to party without knowing?  

**Speaker A:** Good question. We’ll need someone to bring her there. Maybe her sister can invite her to the café casually.  

**Speaker B:** Ah, that’s clever! Her sister can do it. Also, what time we should start?  

**Speaker A:** How about 4 p.m.? That gives us time to set up in the afternoon.  

**Speaker B:** 4 p.m. is good. I will come earlier to help. Maybe 3 p.m.?  

**Speaker A:** Perfect! That’ll give us plenty of time. Thanks for all your help, Li Wei.  

**Speaker B:** No problem! I am happy to help. This will be fun. When we see each other again?  

**Speaker A:** Let’s meet at the café at 3 p.m. on Saturday. Don’t forget to keep it a secret!  

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will remember. See you on Saturday at 3 p.m.!  

**Speaker A:** See you then! Bye!  

**Speaker B:** Bye!
