**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Nice to see you. How are you doing today?  
**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?  

**Speaker A:** I’m doing well, thanks! So, can you tell me about a recent memorable event? Something that stuck with you?  
**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. Last month, I go—um, I went to... friend’s wedding. It was very beautiful.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds lovely! What made it memorable for you?  
**Speaker B:** The place was... um, how to say... outside? In garden. Many flower and lights. And everyone is—was happy.  

**Speaker A:** Oh, an outdoor wedding in a garden? That must have been stunning!  
**Speaker B:** Yes, stunning! I feel very warm and... um, thankful.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a great feeling. Did you dance or take part in any traditions?  
**Speaker B:** Yes! I dance with my friend. And I also drink... uh, wine? Red wine. It was first time for me.  

**Speaker A:** First time drinking red wine? How did you like it?  
**Speaker B:** It was... um, not bad. A little sour, but I like it.  

**Speaker A:** Got it! So, what was the best part of the wedding for you?  
**Speaker B:** I think when my friend... um, how to say... she is crying but also smiling. It was very moving.  

**Speaker A:** That’s so special. Weddings can be really emotional. How did it make you feel overall?  
**Speaker B:** I feel very happy and... um, inspired. I think about my life and future.  

**Speaker A:** That’s wonderful. It’s amazing how events like that can make us reflect on our own lives.  
**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly. It was a very good time.  

**Speaker A:** I’m glad you had such a great experience. Thank you for sharing that with me!  
**Speaker B:** Thank you for listen... listening! It was nice to talk about it.  

**Speaker A:** Of course! It was great hearing about your friend’s wedding. Have a wonderful day!  
**Speaker B:** Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
