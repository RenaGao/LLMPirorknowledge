**Speaker A:** Hi there! Thanks for coming in today. How can I help you with your fitness goals?  
**Speaker B:** Hello, thank you. I want to... um, make my body more strong. And also, I want to lose some... how to say... extra weight.  

**Speaker A:** Got it! So, strength training and weight loss. What kind of exercises do you usually do?  
**Speaker B:** I sometimes run in the park. And, um, I try to do... how to say... push-ups and sit-ups at home. But I don’t have plan.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a good start! Having a plan can help you stay consistent. Do you have any equipment at home, like dumbbells or resistance bands?  
**Speaker B:** I have some dumbbell, but I not use them often. I think... maybe I need more instruction.  

**Speaker A:** I can definitely help with that. We can create a schedule for you. How many days a week can you exercise?  
**Speaker B:** Maybe three or four day. I work many hours, so sometimes I tired.  

**Speaker A:** That’s understandable. Let’s start with three days a week and see how you feel. We can do strength training twice and cardio once. How does that sound?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, that sound good. But, um, what is cardio?  

**Speaker A:** Cardio is exercise like running, cycling, or swimming—it helps with weight loss and heart health.  
**Speaker B:** Ah, I see. I like running, so I think I can do that.  

**Speaker A:** Perfect! We can also include squats, lunges, and planks for strength training. I’ll show you how to use the dumbbells too.  
**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you. I think this plan is very... um, useful.  

**Speaker A:** Great! Do you have any questions or concerns about the plan?  
**Speaker B:** Not now. I will try my best. If I have problem, I will ask you.  

**Speaker A:** Sounds good! Let’s check in next week to see how you’re doing.  
**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you for your help. See you next time!  

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome. Good luck, and I’ll see you soon!
