**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Thank you for talking with me today. Can you tell me about your favorite place to visit?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Ah, yes! My favorite place is, um, park near my home. It is very... peaceful.  

**Speaker A:** Oh, a park? That sounds nice. What makes it special for you?  

**Speaker B:** I like to go there in morning. The air is... um, how to say... very fresh. And I can hear birds singing. It makes me feel... relaxed.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds lovely. Do you go there alone or with others?  

**Speaker B:** Sometimes I go with my family. We sit on grass and, um, eat food together.  

**Speaker A:** Like a picnic?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, picnic! It is... happy time.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds wonderful. Is there anything else you like to do there?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I also like to... um, walk. There is small lake, and I walk around it. Sometimes I see... um, big birds, like ducks.  

**Speaker A:** Ducks? That’s nice. Do you ever feed them?  

**Speaker B:** Yes! I bring bread for them. They come very close. It is... um, fun.  

**Speaker A:** I’m glad you enjoy it so much. When was the last time you visited?  

**Speaker B:** I go there last weekend. The weather was... um, good. Not too hot.  

**Speaker A:** That’s great. It sounds like a perfect place to unwind.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is my favorite place. I feel... um, how to say... like my mind is clear there.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a beautiful way to describe it. Thank you for sharing.  

**Speaker B:** Thank you for listening. I am... um, happy to talk about it.  

**Speaker A:** Me too. Have a great day, and I hope you get to visit the park again soon!  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will go there this weekend. Thank you, and have a good day too!  

**Speaker A:** You too! Take care!
