**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):**  
Hi, thanks for coming to chat about the project. How’s it going so far?  

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):**  
Hello! Um, I think it’s going… okay. We have done, uh, most of the work. Just need… how to say… final check.  

**Speaker A:**  
Got it. So, you’re saying the project is almost finished?  

**Speaker B:**  
Yes, almost finished. But… um, there is one part. It’s, uh, difficult. I need more time to fix it.  

**Speaker A:**  
I see. What part is giving you trouble?  

**Speaker B:**  
It’s the, uh, report. The data is, um… not matching. I need to find… uh, problem.  

**Speaker A:**  
Do you mean the data isn’t consistent?  

**Speaker B:**  
Yes, yes! Not consistent. I think… maybe need two more days to finish.  

**Speaker A:**  
That’s understandable. Two more days should be fine. Is there anything I can do to help?  

**Speaker B:**  
Thank you! Maybe you can… um, check my calculations? I want to make sure they are correct.  

**Speaker A:**  
Of course. Let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll review them.  

**Speaker B:**  
Okay, I will. I think… I can finish by Thursday.  

**Speaker A:**  
That sounds good. Let’s aim for Thursday then. Keep me updated if anything changes.  

**Speaker B:**  
Yes, I will. Thank you for understanding.  

**Speaker A:**  
No problem at all. I appreciate your hard work. Let’s wrap up here for now.  

**Speaker B:**  
Okay. I will send you the report after fixing. Thank you!  

**Speaker A:**  
Sounds great. Have a good day, and let me know if you need anything else.  

**Speaker B:**  
Thank you! Have a good day too.  

**Speaker A:**  
You’re welcome. See you soon!
