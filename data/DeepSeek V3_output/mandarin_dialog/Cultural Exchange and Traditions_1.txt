**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I heard you’re from China. I’m curious, what’s dining etiquette like there?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Ah, yes. In China, we... um, how to say... always give food to others. It is polite. We use chopsticks, not fork.  

**Speaker A:** That’s interesting! Do you pass food to each other directly?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, we use chopsticks to... um... put food in other person’s bowl. But in Western style, I think it is not polite, right?  

**Speaker A:** Not exactly. In Western culture, we usually pass the dishes or bowls instead of using our utensils to give food directly, but it’s nice to hear how it works in China.  

**Speaker B:** Oh, I see. And we always use common... uh, shared dish. Not everyone eat alone.  

**Speaker A:** That makes sense. Here, we often have individual plates, but sharing food is common in some situations too, like with pizza or appetizers.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I notice this. Also, in China, if host give you more food, you must... um, accept it. It means they are very kind.  

**Speaker A:** That’s lovely! In Western culture, we usually say “no, thank you” if we’re full, but it’s polite to compliment the food.  

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. In China, we also say thank you many times. And when we finish, we say... um, “thank you for the meal.”  

**Speaker A:** That’s a great tradition. It’s fascinating to learn about these differences. Is there anything else you’d like to share?  

**Speaker B:** Hmm... yes. In China, younger people always pour drink for older people. It is respect.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a nice way to show respect. Here, it’s polite to pour drinks for others if you’re hosting, but it’s not as formal.  

**Speaker B:** I understand. It is very different, but both are... um, good ways to show politeness.  

**Speaker A:** Exactly! Thank you so much for sharing. It was really interesting to hear about Chinese dining etiquette.  

**Speaker B:** Thank you too. I learn many things about Western style. I think it is... um, very helpful.  

**Speaker A:** Absolutely! If you have more questions, feel free to ask.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will. Thank you for your time.  

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Have a great day.  

**Speaker B:** You too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A:** Goodbye!
