**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):**  
Hi there! How can I help you today?  

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):**  
Hello, um… I have problem with this shirt. It is… how to say… broken. The button is loose.  

**Speaker A:**  
Oh, I see. Did you buy it here?  

**Speaker B:**  
Yes, I buy here last week. I have… receipt. Let me find.  

**Speaker A:**  
No problem, take your time.  

**Speaker B:**  
Here! I find it. So I can… um… return?  

**Speaker A:**  
Yes, you can return it. Our policy allows returns within 30 days with the receipt. Do you want to exchange it or get a refund?  

**Speaker B:**  
I think… exchange is good. I like this shirt, but I need new one.  

**Speaker A:**  
Sure, let’s find you a new one. Do you have the same size and color in mind?  

**Speaker B:**  
Yes, same size and… ah, same color. But if no same color, I choose another.  

**Speaker A:**  
Let me check in the back. Wait here, please.  

**Speaker B:**  
Okay, thank you.  

*(Pause while Speaker A checks)*  

**Speaker A:**  
I found the same color and size! Here you go.  

**Speaker B:**  
Oh, great! Thank you. So I just take this, no need pay?  

**Speaker A:**  
That’s right, no need to pay since it’s an exchange.  

**Speaker B:**  
Good, good. You are very helpful.  

**Speaker A:**  
You’re welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?  

**Speaker B:**  
No, that’s all. Thank you so much.  

**Speaker A:**  
You’re welcome. Have a great day!  

**Speaker B:**  
You too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A:**  
Goodbye! Let me know if you need anything else.
