**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I noticed there was a mix-up with the meeting time yesterday. I just wanted to check in and see if everything’s okay.  
**Speaker B (L2):** Ah, yes, I very sorry about that. My calendar... um, how to say, was not correct. I make mistake.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries at all! It happens to everyone. Did you manage to get the information you needed?  
**Speaker B (L2):** Yes, I talk with my colleague later. She tell me everything. But I still feel... um, bad for the mistake.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I really appreciate you following up. To make sure it doesn’t happen again, would you like me to send you a reminder next time?  
**Speaker B (L2):** Oh, yes, that is very helpful! I think reminder will, uh, help me not forget.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll make sure to do that. Is there anything else I can help with today?  
**Speaker B (L2):** No, thank you. You are very kind to help me. I will, um, be more careful next time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! And don’t worry—mistakes are how we learn. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2):** Thank you! You too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care.
