**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Xiaohui! I wanted to talk about the issue with the project timeline. Do you have a moment?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Yes, of course. I also think this problem... um, we need to fix it.  

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. Let’s start by figuring out what’s causing the delay. What do you think?  

**Speaker B:** I think is because... um, the team is not communicate well. Everyone do their own work, but not... share information.  

**Speaker A:** That makes sense. So maybe we need to set up regular check-ins to share updates. What do you think?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. We can have meeting every week? Or maybe... uh, every few days?  

**Speaker A:** A weekly meeting sounds good. We could also use a shared document to track progress.  

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes, shared document is good idea. I also think... um, maybe we need one person to, how to say... organize everyone’s work.  

**Speaker A:** Like a project manager?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, project manager! I think this can help.  

**Speaker A:** Great. I’ll talk to the team about assigning that role. Anything else you think we should do?  

**Speaker B:** Maybe we can... ah, how to say... make a list of all tasks and who is do them? So it’s clear.  

**Speaker A:** Yes, that’s a good plan. We can call it a task list or a responsibility chart.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, responsibility chart. I think this will help everyone know what they need to do.  

**Speaker A:** Perfect. So, to summarize: weekly meetings, a shared document, a project manager, and a responsibility chart. Does that sound good?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, it’s very good plan. I think now we can, um, solve this problem.  

**Speaker A:** Me too. Thanks for your input, Xiaohui. I’ll get started on organizing these steps.  

**Speaker B:** Thank you too. It’s nice to work together on this.  

**Speaker A:** Definitely. Let’s keep in touch as we move forward.  

**Speaker B:** Yes, we can talk again next week. See you then!  

**Speaker A:** See you next week! Goodbye for now.  

**Speaker B:** Goodbye!
