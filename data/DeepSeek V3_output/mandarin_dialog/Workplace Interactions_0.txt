**Speaker A (Native Speaker):**  
Hi there! Can I help you with something? You look a bit lost.  

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):**  
Ah, yes, thank you. Um... I need to find the... um... big clock? The famous clock in this town.  

**Speaker A:**  
Oh, you mean the Town Hall Clock?  

**Speaker B:**  
Yes! Town Hall Clock. How to go there?  

**Speaker A:**  
It’s not far. Go straight down this road, and you’ll see a big park on your left. The clock is just past the park.  

**Speaker B:**  
Ah, okay. So, go straight and see park... left?  

**Speaker A:**  
Yes, the park will be on your left. After that, turn right at the first street, and you’ll see the clock.  

**Speaker B:**  
Turn right... after park. Got it. And how long it take?  

**Speaker A:**  
About 10 minutes if you walk.  

**Speaker B:**  
Okay, okay. Thank you so much!  

**Speaker A:**  
You’re welcome! Oh, and if you’re hungry, there’s a great café near the clock.  

**Speaker B:**  
Café? Um... where exactly?  

**Speaker A:**  
It’s just next to the clock tower. You can’t miss it.  

**Speaker B:**  
Ah, I see. Next to clock. Thank you again!  

**Speaker A:**  
No problem at all. Enjoy your visit!  

**Speaker B:**  
Yes, I will! Have a nice day!  

**Speaker A:**  
You too! See you around.  

**Speaker B:**  
Goodbye!  

**Speaker A:**  
Bye!  

*(The conversation ends with a polite goodbye, and both speakers express gratitude and well-wishes.)*
