**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Xiao Ming! Do you have time to discuss the team meeting for next week?  

**Speaker B (L2):** Ah, yes, I have time. Let’s discuss.  

**Speaker A:** Great! What do you think we should include in the agenda?  

**Speaker B:** Um... maybe we can talk about the new project. And also... how to say... the schedule for next month?  

**Speaker A:** Good ideas! So, the new project updates and the monthly schedule. Anything else?  

**Speaker B:** Ah, maybe we can... um... discuss the problem with... the thing, uh, software for team communication.  

**Speaker A:** Oh, you mean the communication tool we’ve been having issues with?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. Communication tool. It is not working well.  

**Speaker A:** Got it. That’s an important point. Should we also add time for team feedback or suggestions?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, that is good. Team feedback is... um... very helpful.  

**Speaker A:** Perfect. So the agenda will be: new project updates, the monthly schedule, fixing the communication tool, and team feedback. Does that sound right?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is good. Oh, and maybe we can have... um... small time for questions at the end?  

**Speaker A:** Great suggestion! We’ll add a Q&A session at the end.  

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you. This is clear for me.  

**Speaker A:** Awesome. Let’s plan the meeting for Wednesday at 10 a.m. Does that work for you?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, Wednesday at 10 a.m. is okay.  

**Speaker A:** Perfect. I’ll send out the agenda to the team later today.  

**Speaker B:** Thank you for your help. I will prepare for the meeting.  

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Let me know if you need anything else.  

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will. Thank you, and see you on Wednesday!  

**Speaker A:** See you then!  

**Speaker B:** Goodbye!  

**Speaker A:** Goodbye!
