**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, it’s great to see you! How have you been? Did you do anything fun recently?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Hello! Yes, I just come back from trip. I visit Chicago for first time.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds exciting! How was it?  

**Speaker B:** Oh, it is very nice. Big city, very different from my hometown. I see many tall buildings and... um, how to say... lake. Very big lake.  

**Speaker A:** Lake Michigan?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, Lake Michigan! I walk near there, very beautiful.  

**Speaker A:** That’s great. Did you try any famous Chicago food?  

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes! I eat deep dish pizza. It is... um, very thick, with much cheese. Very delicious!  

**Speaker A:** Perfect choice! Did you visit any museums or landmarks?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I go to Art Institute. There are many... um, paintings and old things. Very interesting.  

**Speaker A:** I love the Art Institute! Did you have a favorite part?  

**Speaker B:** I like the... um, how to say... modern art. It is strange but make me think.  

**Speaker A:** That’s wonderful. Did you meet any locals?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, people are very friendly. One man help me find train station. He say, “Welcome to Chicago!”  

**Speaker A:** That’s so nice! How was the weather?  

**Speaker B:** It is cold, but I have warm clothes. I like weather, not too rainy.  

**Speaker A:** Sounds like you had a great time. Would you go back?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I want to visit again. Maybe next time I go with friends.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a good plan. I’m happy you enjoyed your trip.  

**Speaker B:** Thank you! It was very fun. Next time I will tell you more about it.  

**Speaker A:** I’d love that. Take care and see you soon!  

**Speaker B:** Yes, see you next time! Bye!  

**Speaker A:** Bye!  

(The conversation ends with a natural exchange of goodbyes and agreement to catch up again.)
