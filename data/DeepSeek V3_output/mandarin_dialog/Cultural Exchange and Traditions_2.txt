**Speaker A:** Hi! I heard you’re planning a cultural event. Can you tell me more about it?  
**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. I want to share Chinese... um, how to say... tradition with others.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a great idea! What kind of traditions are you thinking of sharing?  
**Speaker B:** Maybe food, like dumpling. And also... um, Chinese New Year celebration.  

**Speaker A:** Sounds interesting! Will you teach people how to make dumplings?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, I think so. And maybe also show them... um, how to use chopstick.  

**Speaker A:** Chopstick—that’s a good idea. Will you need help organizing the event?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, I think I need help. Maybe for... um, buying things and setting place.  

**Speaker A:** I can help with that. Do you have a date in mind?  
**Speaker B:** Maybe next month. I think... um, second weekend is good.  

**Speaker A:** The second weekend of next month? That works for me. How many people are you expecting?  
**Speaker B:** I think maybe 20 people? I will make poster for invite.  

**Speaker A:** Good idea! Have you thought about what materials you’ll need?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, we need some ingredient for dumpling, and also... um, chopstick and plate.  

**Speaker A:** Got it. What about decorations? Would you like to add some Chinese decorations?  
**Speaker B:** Oh, yes! I can bring red lantern and... um, paper cut. It is very traditional.  

**Speaker A:** That sounds beautiful. Should we also plan a short presentation about Chinese New Year?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, good idea. I can prepare... um, some story and custom about it.  

**Speaker A:** Perfect. I’ll help you with the materials and setup. Let’s meet next week to finalize the details.  
**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you so much! I think this event will be... um, very nice.  

**Speaker A:** I’m sure it will be. Thanks for sharing your culture with us!  
**Speaker B:** Thank you for helping. I will see you next week.  

**Speaker A:** Great! See you then, and let me know if you need anything before we meet.  
**Speaker B:** Okay, I will. Thank you again! Goodbye!  

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Looking forward to it.
