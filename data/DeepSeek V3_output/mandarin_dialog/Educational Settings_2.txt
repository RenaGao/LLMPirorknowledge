**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Xiao Li! Are you ready for the math test next week?  

**Speaker B (L2):** Ah, math test... I feel a little nervous. I am not very good at... um, how to say... the part with numbers and graphs.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean statistics and graphs?  

**Speaker B (L2):** Yes, yes! Statistics and graphs. It is difficult for me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I get that. Maybe we can study together? I found some practice problems online.  

**Speaker B (L2):** That is good idea! I also have some notes, but... um, I think my notes are not very clear.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay. We can go over them and make them clearer. What time works for you?  

**Speaker B (L2):** Maybe... after class tomorrow? At 3 PM?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s meet in the library.  

**Speaker B (L2):** Okay, library at 3 PM. Thank you for helping me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! We’ll make sure you’re ready. Do you have any other worries about the test?  

**Speaker B (L2):** Um, I also not sure about... the part with formulas. Like, remembering all of them.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the formulas? We can make flashcards for those. That helps me a lot.  

**Speaker B (L2):** Flashcards? Ah, yes! I think that will be helpful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. We’ll work on it together.  

**Speaker B (L2):** I feel more confident now. Thank you so much!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! See you tomorrow at 3 PM.  

**Speaker B (L2):** Yes, see you tomorrow. I will bring my notes and... um, the book.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Let’s do our best and ace that test!  

**Speaker B (L2):** Okay, we will do our best. See you tomorrow!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then, Xiao Li!
