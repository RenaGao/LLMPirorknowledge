**Speaker A:** Good morning, Xiaohong! How are you today?  
**Speaker B:** Good morning, teacher! I am fine, thank you. But I have... um, little confusion about homework.  
**Speaker A:** No problem! What’s the confusion about?  
**Speaker B:** The last question in assignment. I... I don’t understand what we need to write.  
**Speaker A:** Ah, you mean question 3? The one about comparing two historical events?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, that one. Is it... um, need to write about... how they are same?  
**Speaker A:** Exactly. You need to explain the similarities between the American Revolution and the French Revolution.  
**Speaker B:** Similarities... okay. But how many? Like, one or two?  
**Speaker A:** At least three similarities. And try to explain why they’re important.  
**Speaker B:** Oh, I see! Thank you. But... um, can I use internet for help?  
**Speaker A:** Sure, you can use it to research, but make sure to write in your own words.  
**Speaker B:** Okay, I will. Um... one more thing. When is… when we need to give the homework?  
**Speaker A:** The deadline is this Friday by 5 p.m.  
**Speaker B:** Friday 5 p.m., I understand. Thank you very much, teacher!  
**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Let me know if you have more questions.  
**Speaker B:** Yes, I will. Thank you again! Have a nice day!  
**Speaker A:** You too, Xiaohong! Goodbye!  
**Speaker B:** Goodbye, teacher!
