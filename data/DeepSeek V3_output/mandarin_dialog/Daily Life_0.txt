**Speaker A:** Hi! How’s it going? Do you have time to chat about your morning routine?
**Speaker B:** Hi! Yes, I have time. My morning routine is... um... quite normal, I think.
**Speaker A:** That’s good to hear. What time do you usually wake up?
**Speaker B:** I wake up at 6:30. But sometimes... um... when I sleep late, I wake up at 7:00.
**Speaker A:** Got it. Do you have breakfast right after waking up?
**Speaker B:** Yes, I eat breakfast, but not right away. First, I... um... brush my teeth and wash my face.
**Speaker A:** That makes sense. What do you usually have for breakfast?
**Speaker B:** I usually eat... um... bread and egg. And sometimes porridge. My mom say porridge is good for stomach.
**Speaker A:** That’s nice. Do you drink coffee or tea in the morning?
**Speaker B:** Yes, I drink tea. Green tea, not coffee. I don’t like coffee... it’s too strong for me.
**Speaker A:** I see. What about exercise? Do you do anything in the morning?
**Speaker B:** Sometimes I do... um... light exercise. Just stretch or walk around my house before I go to work.
**Speaker A:** That’s a good idea. Do you listen to music or the news during breakfast?
**Speaker B:** No, I don’t. I prefer to... um... think about my day or just enjoy quiet time.
**Speaker A:** Sounds peaceful. What time do you usually leave for work?
**Speaker B:** I leave at 8:00. My office is... um... not far from my home, so I take bus or sometimes walk.
**Speaker A:** That’s convenient. Thanks for sharing! It’s interesting to hear about your routine.
**Speaker B:** Thank for asking! It’s nice to talk with you. I must go now, so I will say goodbye.
**Speaker A:** Sure, goodbye! Have a great day!
**Speaker B:** Thank you, you too! Goodbye!
