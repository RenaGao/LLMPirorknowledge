**Speaker A:** Hi there! Thanks for chatting with me today. Could you tell me about a skill you’d like to learn?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes! I want to learn… um, how to say… playing the piano.

**Speaker A:** That’s great! Why do you want to learn piano?

**Speaker B:** I think piano is very beautiful. When I hear the music, I feel… um, peaceful. Also, I want to make my family happy by playing for them.

**Speaker A:** That’s such a nice reason. How do you plan to learn? Will you take lessons?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I think so. Maybe I find a teacher or… um, use online class. But I don’t know if I have enough time. I have many work now.

**Speaker A:** I see. It can be hard to balance, but starting with small steps might help. Do you have a piano or keyboard?

**Speaker B:** No, not yet. I need to buy one… uh, how to say… small piano. Is called electric piano?

**Speaker A:** Yes, an electric keyboard. That’s a good start. They’re usually more affordable and take up less space.

**Speaker B:** Oh, good idea! Maybe I buy one next month. I also think it’s good for my mind… um, like, make me more smart.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely! Learning music is great for your brain and creativity. Have you tried learning any other instruments before?

**Speaker B:** No, never. Piano is my first. I hope I can do it, but I think it will take… um, many year.

**Speaker A:** It does take time, but with practice, you’ll improve. Just enjoy the process.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I think so. Thank you for your advice. It makes me feel more… um, confident.

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! I’m glad I could help. Good luck with your piano journey!

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much! I will try my best. Maybe one day I can play a song for you.

**Speaker A:** I’d love that! Let me know when you’re ready.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will. Thank you again. Have a nice day!

**Speaker A:** You too! Take care and good luck!

**Speaker B:** Goodbye! See you next time!  

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Have a great day!
