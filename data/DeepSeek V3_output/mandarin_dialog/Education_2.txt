**Speaker A (Teacher):** Hi, Xiao Li. How can I help you?  
**Speaker B (Xiao Li):** Hello, teacher. I have question about homework.  
**Speaker A:** Sure, what’s your question?  
**Speaker B:** Um, in question number three, I don’t understand what it... uh, means.  
**Speaker A:** Let me see. Ah, you mean the part about analyzing the poem’s theme?  
**Speaker B:** Yes, that part. I don’t know how to... um, what is "theme"?  
**Speaker A:** The theme is the main idea or message of the poem. What do you think the author is trying to say?  
**Speaker B:** Oh, I think... maybe, joy? Or happiness?  
**Speaker A:** That’s a good start! Why do you think that?  
**Speaker B:** Because the poem has many words like “sun,” “smile,” and “laugh.”  
**Speaker A:** Excellent observation! You’re on the right track. Just write a few sentences explaining why those words suggest joy.  
**Speaker B:** Okay, I can do that. Um, how many sentences?  
**Speaker A:** Two or three should be enough. Make sure your ideas are clear.  
**Speaker B:** Yes, teacher. Thank you for... explaining.  
**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Let me know if you need more help.  
**Speaker B:** I will. Goodbye, teacher!  
**Speaker A:** Goodbye, Xiao Li. Good luck with your homework!
