**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I noticed you’ve been looking at those headphones. Are you thinking of buying them?  

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Yes, I think so. But I’m not sure... um, how to say... if they are good for the price.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a fair point. What’s most important to you in headphones? Sound quality, comfort, or something else?  

**Speaker B:** Sound quality is... um, very important. I like clear sound. And also, they should be... um, comfortable for long time.  

**Speaker A:** Got it. These ones are noise-canceling, which means they block out a lot of background noise. Do you think that’s something you’d use?  

**Speaker B:** Noise... canceling? Ah, yes! That is good. I often take bus, so maybe it is useful.  

**Speaker A:** Perfect. They’re also wireless, so no tangled cords. Do you prefer wireless headphones?  

**Speaker B:** Wireless is... um, convenient. But I worry about battery. How long it can work?  

**Speaker A:** Good question! They’re advertised to last about 20 hours on a single charge. That’s usually enough for a full day of use.  

**Speaker B:** Oh, 20 hours? That’s not bad. But I also see they are... um, expensive. Do you think it’s worth it?  

**Speaker A:** It depends on your budget. If you’re looking for something high-quality that will last a long time, these could be worth the investment. But if you’re on a tight budget, maybe there are cheaper options.  

**Speaker B:** Hmm... I think I need some time to decide. Maybe I will check other options first.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a good idea. It’s always best to compare before buying. Let me know if you need help with anything else!  

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much! You are very helpful. I will think more and maybe come back later.  

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Take your time. See you later!  

**Speaker B:** See you! Have a nice day.
