**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I see you’re selling these beautiful handbags. How much is this one?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, this one... um, it is 1,200 baht. Good quality, handmade.  
**Speaker A (NS):** 1,200 baht? It’s lovely, but that seems a bit high. Can you go lower?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, how to say... I can give discount. Maybe... 1,000 baht?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s better. Is 800 baht possible?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** *[pauses]* 800 baht... if you buy two, I can do 800 each.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I only need one. How about 900 baht?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, 900 baht. But no more discount, sorry. *[smiles]*  
**Speaker A (NS):** Fair enough. 900 baht it is. Do you take credit cards?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Uh, no card, only cash. Have you cash?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I think so. Let me check... *[looks in wallet]* Yes, I have 900 baht.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Perfect! Thank you. I will wrap for you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great. By the way, do you make these yourself?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I make. My family help too. We come from Chiang Mai.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that’s amazing. They’re really beautiful.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. I hope you enjoy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I will. Here’s the money. Thank you!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you too. Please come again!  
**Speaker A (NS):** I definitely will. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
