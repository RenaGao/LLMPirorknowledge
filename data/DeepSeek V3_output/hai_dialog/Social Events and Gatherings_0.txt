**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I don’t think we’ve met. My name is Alex. How about you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello, Alex. My name is Nuch. Nice to meet you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you too, Nuch. Are you visiting, or do you live around here?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I live here now. I move to this city... um, three months before.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, welcome! How are you finding it so far?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is good. People very friendly. But, um... the weather is very cold for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, it can get chilly here. Where are you from originally?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I from Thailand. Bangkok is my home.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Bangkok! I’ve heard it’s a very vibrant city. What do you miss most about it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I miss the food. Thai food is... how to say... very special. And also my family.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Thai food is amazing. Do you cook Thai food here?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I try. But some ingredient is... um... difficult to find.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I bet. Are there any Thai restaurants here you like?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, there is one. Not same as home, but... it’s okay.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll have to check it out. What do you do for work here?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I work in hospital. I am... um, nurse.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. It must be really rewarding.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like to help people. But sometimes, many patients make me tired.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine. You’re doing important work.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. And you? What is your work?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m a teacher. I teach high school English.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Very nice! I think English is... um, very hard.  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s not easy, but you’re doing great!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. It’s nice to talk with you, Alex.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Nuch. Let’s chat again soon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I hope so. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Nuch! Take care.
