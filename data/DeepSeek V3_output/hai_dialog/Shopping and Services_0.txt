**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! Did you have time to review the math assignment? It’s a bit tricky.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, hello! Yes, I try, but some part I not understand. Like... um, the equation with letter?

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you mean the algebraic equations, with variables like "x" and "y"?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes! Variable. I confuse how to find the... the answer for "x."

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Let’s go through it step by step. First, you need to isolate "x." Here’s an example: 2x + 3 = 7. Do you understand this part?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes. We must make "x" alone, right? So... minus 3 from both side?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! So, 2x = 4. Then, what’s next?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Next, divide both side by 2. So, "x" is... 2?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! You’ve got it. Does that make sense now?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, I think so. But sometimes, the equation have more... um, complicated?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, when there are more terms, you might need to combine like terms or use distributive property. Want to try one like that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, but I think I need time for understand. Maybe we can... um, meet again tomorrow?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Let’s meet tomorrow at the same time. We’ll work on more examples then.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That’s good idea. Thank you so much for help me!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I’m happy to help. See you tomorrow, Nuch!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you tomorrow! Thank you again!
