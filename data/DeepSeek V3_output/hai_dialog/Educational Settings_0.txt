**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! Do you have a minute to talk about the assignment?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, teacher, I have minute. Um... I have some question, please?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What’s unclear to you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I not understand the part... uh, how to say... the part about “reflection.” What is meaning?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, “reflection” means thinking about what you’ve learned. You write about your thoughts and feelings on the topic.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I see. So, I write about... um, what I think and feel?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And you can also write about what was difficult or what you enjoyed.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, teacher. And... uh, how many word I need to write?  
**Speaker A (NS):** It should be about 300 words. Does that make sense?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** 300 words? Um... okay. Is it okay if I write... maybe little more or little less?  
**Speaker A (NS):** A little more or less is fine, but try to stay close to 300.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I try. And... um, when is deadline?  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s due next Friday by 5 PM. Do you think you’ll have enough time?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, teacher. I think I can finish. If I have more question, can I ask you again?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! You can email me or come by my office anytime.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, teacher. You help me very much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Nuch. Let me know if you need anything else.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, teacher. I will. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Nuch! See you in class.
