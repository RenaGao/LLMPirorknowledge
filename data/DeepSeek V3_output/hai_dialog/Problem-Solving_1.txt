**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thank you for calling Tech Support. My name is Alex. How can I assist you today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello, Alex. My name is Nuch. I have problem with my computer.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sorry to hear that, Nuch. What exactly is the issue?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, my computer is... how to say... not turn on. Screen is black.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So your computer won’t turn on at all?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, no light, no sound. Just black.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. First, let’s check the power. Is your charger connected properly?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I check. The charger is connect, but still not work.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. Can you try holding the power button down for 10 seconds?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I try. *pauses* Um, still not work.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright. Let’s try removing the battery if it’s removable. Do you know how to do that?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think no... my battery is... inside. Not come out.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Understood. If the battery isn’t removable, let’s try resetting the power. Unplug the charger, then press and hold the power button for 30 seconds.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I do now. *pauses* Still nothing.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Hmm, it seems like a deeper issue. Have you noticed any problems with your computer before this happened?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, sometimes it is... um... very slow. And it make noise.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That could be related. It might be a hardware issue. Let’s schedule a repair. Can I have your computer’s model number?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, I think it is... um... ASUS 5... something. I don’t remember.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Can you check the bottom of the laptop? There’s usually a sticker with the model.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! It is ASUS 550.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll book a repair for you. Would Wednesday at 10 a.m. work for you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is okay. Thank you, Alex.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Nuch. Is there anything else I can help with today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, that is all. Thank you for your help.  

**Speaker A (NS):** My pleasure. We’ll see you on Wednesday. Have a great day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
