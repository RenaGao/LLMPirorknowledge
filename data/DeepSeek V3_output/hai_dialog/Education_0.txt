**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! How’s it going?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! I’m good, thank you. How about you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. So, I heard we have an exam next week. Are you ready for it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, exam… I feel a little nervous. Many things to remember.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Which part do you find the most difficult?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think… the grammar part. It’s confusing for me. Like, when to use “he has” or “he have.”  

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. It’s “he has.” The verb changes depending on the subject.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes, “he has.” I always forget. And also, um… vocabulary is hard.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Vocabulary can be tricky. Maybe we can review together sometime?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that would be good! Maybe we meet… um, on Friday?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Friday works for me. Should we meet at the library?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, library is good. What time?  

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 3 p.m.?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Three p.m. is okay. I will bring my book and… um, notes.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll bring mine too. We can go over grammar and vocabulary.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you so much. I feel better now.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! We’ll help each other.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, together is better.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, let’s meet at the library on Friday at 3 p.m.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, see you then!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you, Nuch! Good luck with your studying.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! You too. Bye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
