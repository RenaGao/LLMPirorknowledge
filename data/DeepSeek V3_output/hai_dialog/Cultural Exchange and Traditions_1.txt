**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! Thanks for meeting with me today. I thought we could talk about dining etiquette. Are there any Thai customs that might surprise foreigners?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, thank you. In Thailand, we use spoon and fork most time. Chopsticks is more for noodle. And we... um, share food. Everyone eat from same dish.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting! Is there a specific way to serve food or eat it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we use spoon for eat, and fork is for... how to say... pushing food. Also, we never stick chopsticks in rice. It look like... um, for dead people.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. That’s good to know. What about table manners? Are there things we shouldn’t do?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, never touch someone’s head. It is rude. And when you eat with older people, you should wait for them to eat first.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s thoughtful. In my culture, it’s polite to keep your hands on the table, not in your lap. Is that different in Thailand?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Actually, it is same. We also keep hands on table. But we don’t... um, point with feet. Feet is lowest part of body.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. What about drinks? Are there any customs around that?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** When someone pour drink for you, you hold glass with two hand. It show respect. And when you cheers, glass should be lower than older person.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice way to show respect. Is tipping common in Thailand?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Not all time. Some restaurant already have service charge. But if not, we leave small tip. Just coins or... um, 10% of bill.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. What’s one thing you find surprising about dining in other cultures?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** In some country, people eat alone. In Thailand, we always eat together. It feel strange to eat alone. And... fork in left hand, spoon in right? I find it difficult.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I can see how that would feel different. Thanks for sharing all this, Lek. I’ve learned a lot!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you too! It’s nice to talk about this. Maybe one day we eat together, and I show you Thai food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Let’s plan it soon. Thanks again, Lek, and take care!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, take care too. See you next time!
