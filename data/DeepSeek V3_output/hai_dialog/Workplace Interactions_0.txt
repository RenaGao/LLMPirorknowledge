**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! How’s everything going with the project?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, hello! Um, it’s okay. I work on the report, but I need more time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. When do you think you can finish it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe... Friday? I have some problem with the data—um, numbers not match.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Do you need help with that?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, please. How to say... I not sure how to fix.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! We can go over it together. When are you free?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Tomorrow morning, uh, 10 o’clock?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That works. Let’s meet at 10. What about the other task—the presentation slides?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, slides finish already. I just check again for mistake.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! So, the slides are ready, and we’ll work on the data issue tomorrow. Anything else?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... no, I think that’s all. Thank you for your help.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Don’t hesitate to ask if you need anything else. Let’s make sure everything’s on track.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I will try my best. See you tomorrow, 10 o’clock.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Have a great day, Nuch!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Thank you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow! Let’s make this project a success!
