**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, it’s nice to meet you! I’m Sarah. What’s your name?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello, Sarah. My name is Noi. Nice to meet you too.  

**Speaker A (NS):** So, Noi, what do you like to do in your free time?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Uh, I like to watch movie. Also, I enjoy cooking, but not very good yet.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s great! What kind of movies do you like?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like romantic movie... um, comedy too. But romantic is my favorite.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice! I watch romantic movies sometimes too. Do you have a favorite one?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like... um, how to say... "The Notebook." Have you watch it?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I’ve seen it. It’s a classic! What about cooking? What do you like to make?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I try to make Thai food. Pad Thai is... I think very famous in my country.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Pad Thai is delicious! Do you cook it often?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Not so often. But my mom teach me. I still make mistake sometimes.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay; practice makes perfect. Do you like other kinds of food too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like Japanese food. Sushi is my favorite.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! I love sushi. Have you ever tried making it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I never try. It looks hard. Maybe one day I will learn.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You should! It’s fun once you get the hang of it. So, cooking and movies—anything else you enjoy?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... I like to travel. But now, I cannot because... no time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Where would you like to go when you can travel again?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I want to visit Japan. It is beautiful, and I like the culture.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Japan is amazing! I’ve been there once. You’ll love it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Really? That is nice. Maybe you can tell me about your trip next time.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’d love to! It was great talking with you, Noi.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, me too. Thank you, Sarah. See you next time!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you! Take care.
