**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! How are you today?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I’m good, thank you! How about you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m great, thanks. So, I was thinking, should we plan a group vacation together?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, that sound fun! Where we go?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Hmm, how about the beach? Or maybe the mountains?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Beach is nice. I like swim and sunbathing. What you think?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good to me! Do you have a specific beach in mind?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe… um, Phuket? It’s very famous in Thailand.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Phuket sounds perfect! What activities can we do there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We can snorkeling, um… visit island, and eat seafood. Very delicious!  
**Speaker A (NS):** That all sounds amazing. When should we go?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe December? Weather is nice, not too hot.  
**Speaker A (NS):** December works for me. How long should we stay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think… five to seven days is good. Not too short, not too long.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. Should we invite more friends?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, Lek and Pim also want to go. They like travel too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll check the flights and hotels. Can you help with the activities?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I can find tour for snorkeling and island trip.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s finalize everything next week, okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay! I’m so excited. Thank you for plan together.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! See you soon, Nuch!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** See you soon!
