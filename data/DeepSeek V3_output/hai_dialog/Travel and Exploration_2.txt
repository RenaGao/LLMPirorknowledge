**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can I help you with something? You look a bit lost.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, thank you. I try to find... um, the big clock tower. The... um, how to say... landmark?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean the Central Clock Tower?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes! That one. I not know how to go there.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Do you have a map or know where you are now?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I am here, at... um, the shopping mall. The big one.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, okay. The mall is close to the clock tower. You just need to walk straight for about five minutes.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Straight? No turn left or right?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right. Go straight until you see a big fountain. The clock tower is right behind it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, okay. Fountain is... water thing, right?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You’ll hear the water, too.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I think I can go there.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Let me know if you need more help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, thank you so much. Then I will walk... go to the fountain.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Enjoy your visit to the clock tower!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will. Thank you again. Have a nice day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Take care.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, and good luck!
