**Scene:** Two classmates, Emma (a native English speaker) and Nong (a Thai second-language learner), are discussing a challenging topic in their study group.

**Emma:** Hi, Nong! How’s it going? Ready to talk about the assignment?  
**Nong:** Hello, Emma! Yes, I try to understand. But... um, the topic is a little difficult for me.  
**Emma:** No worries! Which part are you finding tricky?  
**Nong:** The part about... how to say... "photosynthesis"?  
**Emma:** Oh, photosynthesis! Yeah, that can be confusing. Do you want to go over it together?  
**Nong:** Yes, please. I think I know, but... um, maybe I miss something.  
**Emma:** Sure! So, photosynthesis is how plants make their food. They use sunlight, water, and... do you remember the other thing?  
**Nong:** Ah, yes! The... "carbon dioxide"?  
**Emma:** Exactly! Plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Does that make sense?  
**Nong:** Oh, yes. I understand now. But... um, why it is important?  
**Emma:** Good question! It’s important because plants produce oxygen, which we need to breathe. Plus, they help remove carbon dioxide from the air.  
**Nong:** Ah, I see! So, if no plants, we... um... how to say... have problem?  
**Emma:** Right! Without plants, we’d have less oxygen and more carbon dioxide, which isn’t good for us or the environment.  
**Nong:** Now I understand better. Thank you, Emma! You explain very clear.  
**Emma:** You’re welcome! Do you feel more confident about the topic now?  
**Nong:** Yes, I feel better. I think I can explain to others in group.  
**Emma:** That’s great! Let’s meet again if you need more help, okay?  
**Nong:** Okay, thank you! I will try my best.  
**Emma:** You’re doing great, Nong. Have a good day!  
**Nong:** You too, Emma. Goodbye!
