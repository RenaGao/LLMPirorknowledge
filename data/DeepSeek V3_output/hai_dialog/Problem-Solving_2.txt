**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! How are you doing today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, hello! I am... fine, thank you. But, um... I have something to tell you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. What’s on your mind?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I want to say sorry because I... I forget to bring the book you lend me. I feel very bad for this.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, don’t worry. It happens. Do you know where it is?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I think it is at my home. I leave it on my table when I... uh, how to say... when I go to work.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. No problem. When will you be able to return it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe... tomorrow? I can bring it to you in the morning. Is that okay?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect. What time works for you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... maybe 9 o’clock? Or... 9:30? You choose.  

**Speaker A (NS):** 9:30 would be great. Thank you.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, thank you for understand. I will not forget again. Promise.  

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s alright, really. I appreciate you letting me know.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I try to... to be careful next time. I want to make it up to you. Maybe I can buy you coffee?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very kind of you, but it’s not necessary. Just bringing the book is enough.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, if you say so. But I still want to say thank you for being so nice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Lek. See you tomorrow at 9:30 then?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you tomorrow. And sorry again.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries at all. Have a good day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care.
