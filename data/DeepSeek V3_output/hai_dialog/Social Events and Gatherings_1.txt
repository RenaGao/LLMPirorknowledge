**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Pim! We’re planning a surprise party for Sarah this weekend. Are you free to join us?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, surprise party? Yes, I free! I want to join. When it will be?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We’re thinking Saturday evening. Does that work for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Saturday evening? Yes, it’s okay. Where we do it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** At my place. We’ll decorate and prepare some food. Can you help with anything?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I can help. Um... how to say... I can bring food? Maybe Thai dish?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect! Sarah loves Thai food. What dish are you thinking of?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think... pad Thai. It is easy to make and everyone like it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds delicious! I’ll take care of the decorations and drinks.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay. What time I should come?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Can you come around 4 PM? We’ll need time to set up before Sarah arrives at 6.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** 4 PM? Yes, I come. Oh, does Sarah know about party?  
**Speaker A (NS):** No, it’s a surprise! So please keep it a secret.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I understand. I won’t tell her. Promise.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, Pim. Any other ideas for the party?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hmm... maybe we play music? Sarah like to dance.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! I’ll make a playlist. Anything else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... maybe we take photo? To remember the fun time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great suggestion. I’ll bring my camera.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay. I think it will be very fun. I’m excited!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Thanks for helping, Pim. See you on Saturday!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you on Saturday. I can’t wait!
