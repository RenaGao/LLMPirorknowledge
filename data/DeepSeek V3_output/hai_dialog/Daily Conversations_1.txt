**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Nuch! How are you doing? Any plans for the weekend?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, hi! I am... um, good. Yes, I have plan. I want to go Chatuchak Park.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Chatuchak Park? That sounds nice. What do you want to do there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I want to... um, walk around. And maybe shop. Ah, how to say... buy some things.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Shopping and strolling? That’s a great idea. The weather’s been nice lately.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, weather is good. I want to go early, so... um, not too hot.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Smart move. Early mornings are the best. What time are you planning to go?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think... um, 8:30. Is that okay?  

**Speaker A (NS):** 8:30 is perfect. Are you going with someone?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I go with my friend Lek. She will... um, bring some food.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! You’ll have snacks for the trip.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, and I will prepare drink. We can eat and... um, talk together.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of food is she bringing?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** She will bring... um, Thai food. Maybe som tam and sticky rice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I love som tam! That’s going to be a great picnic.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I think so. We will meet at 8:30 and then go to park.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a solid plan. I hope you have a wonderful time.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let me know how it goes.
