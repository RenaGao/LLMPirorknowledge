**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Som! Do you have a moment? I’d love to hear about your favorite holiday in Thailand.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! I can talk. My favorite holiday is... um, Songkran.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Songkran? That sounds interesting. What is it about?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is Thai New Year. We celebrate in April. We... how to say... throw water to each other.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Throw water? Like, a water fight?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, water fight! But also, it is for... um, washing bad thing away. So, it is... special.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really cool! Do you also visit family during Songkran?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I go to my family. We... um, give respect to old people. We pour water on their hands.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds very meaningful. Do you have any special food for Songkran?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! We eat... how to say... noodle with curry. It is... Khao Soi.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Khao Soi? I’ve heard of that. It’s delicious!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, very tasty! And also, we have... um, fruit like mango with sweet sticky rice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I love mango sticky rice! It sounds like Songkran is a lot of fun.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it is fun! Everyone is happy. We play water, eat food, and... um, spend time with family.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. Thank you for sharing about Songkran. I’d love to experience it someday.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You should come! I can... um, show you how to throw water.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Thanks again, Som. Have a great day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! You have a good day too. See you later!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later!
