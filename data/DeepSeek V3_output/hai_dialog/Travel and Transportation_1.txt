**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can I help you with something?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, thank you. I am looking for... um, hotel near here. Do you know where is it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! What’s the name of the hotel?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is called, um... Green Valley Hotel.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Green Valley Hotel! It’s not too far. You need to go straight for two blocks, then turn left.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Straight two block... then left. Okay. And it is easy to see?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it’s a big building with a green sign. You can’t miss it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, good. Um... how long to walk there?  
**Speaker A (NS):** About 10 minutes, I think. Not too long.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, thank you. And... is there... um, thing for eating close to hotel?  
**Speaker A (NS):** A restaurant? Yes, there’s one just next to the hotel. They serve great food.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That is good! I like to try new food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’ll enjoy it. Let me know if you need help with anything else.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you so much. You are very kind.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Have a great day at the hotel.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, thank you. You too. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, and enjoy your stay!
