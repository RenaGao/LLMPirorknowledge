**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Pim! How’s it going?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, hello! I’m good, thank you. How about you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I was thinking—do you want to go out this evening? Maybe for dinner or something fun?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! I would like. But... um, where we go?  

**Speaker A (NS):** How about trying that new Italian restaurant downtown? I heard it’s really good.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Italian? Um... I not eat Italian food before. Is it spicy?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Not really. It’s more about pasta, pizza, and things like that. Do you like those?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! I like pizza. But... um, pizza here very big. In Thailand, pizza is small, for one person.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Here, it’s usually shared. We can split one if you like.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, good idea. After dinner, we do activity?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! What do you feel like doing? Maybe see a movie or go for a walk?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Walk is nice. I like... how to say... see the city at night.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. We can walk by the river—it’s really beautiful in the evening.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like that. Oh, but... um, what time we meet?  

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 6:30? That way, we have plenty of time for dinner and the walk.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** 6:30 is okay for me. I come to your place, or we meet at restaurant?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s meet at the restaurant. I’ll send you the address.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, thank you. I will check map.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And don’t worry—if you have any trouble finding it, just call me.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I will. Thank you so much!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. I’m looking forward to it.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Me too! See you at 6:30, okay?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. See you then!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Bye-bye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Pim! Take care.
