**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Welcome to the team. I heard you’ll be helping us with the new project. How are you finding everything so far?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, thank you! I am... uh, feeling good. But maybe I need to learn more about project. Can you explain a little?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! We’re working on a new website for our clients. Do you have experience with web design?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I do some website before. But I not expert. I use, um... how to say... tools like HTML and CSS.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! HTML and CSS are essential. We’re also using JavaScript for interactive features. Have you worked with JavaScript before?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** JavaScript... ah, yes, but I not very sure. I know basic, but I need to practice more.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, we’ll start with the basics. The first task is to create a homepage. I’ll guide you step by step. Ready?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, ready. But, um... what is... the first thing I should do?  
**Speaker A (NS):** First, we’ll draft the layout using HTML. Think of it like building the skeleton of the page. After that, we’ll add styles with CSS.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, I see. So HTML is like... um, the bone? And CSS is... the skin?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You’ve got it. Once the layout is ready, we’ll use JavaScript to add functionalities, like buttons or animations.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I think I understand. But if I have question, can I ask you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Feel free to ask anytime. We’re here to support you.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you so much! I will try my best.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let’s start with the homepage layout today. We’ll take it step by step.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Good idea. I start with HTML now?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, go ahead. If you get stuck, just let me know.  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I will do. Thank you for explaining.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let’s meet again in an hour to check your progress. Does that work for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, one hour is good. I see you later.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! See you then. Good luck with the task!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I will do my best. See you soon!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright! Let’s catch up in an hour to see how it’s going. Goodbye for now!  
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Goodbye! Thank you again!
