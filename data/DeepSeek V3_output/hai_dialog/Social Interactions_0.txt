**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I here for one year now. Time goes so fast!  

**Speaker A (NS):** It really does. Do you like living here?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it is nice. But sometimes I miss Thai food. Here is not spicy enough.  

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) I can imagine. Thai food is amazing. Do you cook for yourself?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I try. But, um, it is not same like home.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure it’s still delicious. What do you like to do in your free time?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like to... um, watch movie. And I go to park for run.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun. Do you have any favorite movies?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like... um, action movie. And also, Thai drama.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice choices! I’ve heard Thai dramas are really popular.
