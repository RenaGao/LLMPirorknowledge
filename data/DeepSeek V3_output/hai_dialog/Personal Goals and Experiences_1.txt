**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! It’s great to see you today. Can you tell me about a skill you’d like to learn?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. I want learn... um, how to say... speaking English better. Is it... important for my job.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a very useful skill! Why is improving your English important for your job?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Because my company, they have many... um, foreign clients. I need talk with them, but sometimes I feel... not confident.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Confidence is key when speaking a foreign language. How are you planning to improve?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think... maybe join English class. And also I watch YouTube, but sometimes it’s... um, too fast for me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start! Watching YouTube is helpful because you can hear natural conversations. Maybe you can slow down the video speed?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! I didn’t know I can do that. Thank you for... telling me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Do you have any specific areas you want to focus on, like grammar or vocabulary?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Grammar is... difficult for me. Sometimes I say, “He have” instead of “He has.” And I don’t know many... um, difficult words.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very common. Grammar takes time to master. Maybe you can practice with a language partner or use apps like Duolingo?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I try Duolingo before. It’s good, but I need more... um, speaking practice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Speaking practice is important. Have you thought about joining a conversation club or finding a tutor?  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Conversation club? Yes, I think I will find one. Thank you for... your advice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! It sounds like you have a clear plan. I’m sure you’ll improve quickly with practice.  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I hope so. Thank you for... talking with me. It helps a lot.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re doing great! Keep practicing, and you’ll see progress. Good luck with your English journey!  

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I will try my best. See you again!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you! Take care!
