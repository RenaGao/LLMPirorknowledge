**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Farah, how’s it going? Have you started studying for the math test yet?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi! Ah, not yet. I... I have many other thing to do. Math is difficult for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Math can be tricky. Maybe we can study together? It might help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, that’s good idea! I like study with friend. But I not sure how to... um, organize study time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. We can make a schedule. How about we meet tomorrow after class?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, can. Tomorrow after class is okay. Um, what topic we will study?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s start with algebra. It’s a big part of the test.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Algebra? Ah, I forget many thing about algebra. Maybe I need to... uh, review again.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry. I can explain it to you. Practice makes perfect!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, thank you. I feel... um, more confident if I have friend to help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! We’ll do well if we work together. Do you have any tips for studying? Like, how do you usually prepare for tests?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** My way is... um, I write note. And then, I read many time. But sometimes I forget.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Writing notes is good! Maybe you can try practice questions too. It helps with understanding.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, practice question? I think that is good idea. I will try.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, tomorrow after class, we’ll meet at the library?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, library is okay. I will bring my note and... um, my calculator.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll bring my materials too. Let’s do our best!
