**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Farah, it’s great to see you! So, what are your goals for the next year?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, ah… next year I want to improve my English. Because, um, I need it for my work.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good goal! How do you plan to do it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think… I will join English class. And also, I try to speak more with English-speaking friend, like you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a solid plan. Do you have any other goals?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want also to save money. For… um, how to say… something for future.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Like a long-term investment or maybe travel?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, travel! I want to visit Japan. I hear it is very nice place.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Japan is beautiful! Do you have a specific plan to save money?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I will… um, reduce spend money on unnecessary thing. Like eating out too much. And I also put some money in bank every month.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great strategy. You’re very focused! Are there any challenges you think might come up?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think… sometimes it is difficult to stay motivated. Especially when work is busy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Maybe you can set small milestones to keep yourself on track.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, that is good idea. I will try to do that.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I believe you can achieve your goals!  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. Your words make me feel more confident.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. By the way, do you have a timeline for these goals?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I hope to improve English in six month. And for saving money, I aim to have enough for Japan trip by end of next year.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very specific. I’m sure you’ll do well.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. Your support… um, how to say… make me feel happy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that! Let’s check in again soon and see how things are going.
