Hi, could I ask a question about the assignment?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
Oh, yes, sure. What is your... problem?  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
I’m a bit confused about the word limit. Is it 500 words or 1,000?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
Ah, I think it is 500. But... um, let me check. Yes, it is 500 words.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
Okay, thanks. Also, do we have to include references?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
Yes, need. Reference is important. But... um, how to say... just minimum two is enough.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
Got it. So, 500 words with at least two references. Anything else I should know?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
Ah, yes. Please use... um, APA style. And don’t forget submission... uh, last day is Friday.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
Okay, APA style and submit by Friday. Thanks so much for clarifying!  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
You’re welcome. If you have more question, just ask me.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
Will do. Have a great day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
You too, good bye!
