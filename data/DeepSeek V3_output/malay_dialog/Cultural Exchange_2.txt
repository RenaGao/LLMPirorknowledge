**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Farah, do you have a moment? I’d love to hear about your favorite holiday in Malaysia.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! My favorite holiday is... um, how to say... Hari Raya Aidilfitri.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Hari Raya Aidilfitri? That sounds interesting. What’s it about?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It is after Ramadan, the fasting month. We celebrate with family and... uh, how to say... open house.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Open house? Does that mean you invite people to your home?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes! We invite friends, family, even neighbor. We cook many food and... um... wear traditional clothes.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! What kind of food do you usually prepare?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, we have ketupat, rendang, and lemang. Ketupat is rice in coconut leaf, rendang is... um, spicy meat, and lemang is rice in bamboo.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Do you have any special traditions?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we give money to children. It is called... um, duit raya. And we ask forgiveness from each other.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s such a meaningful tradition. Is it celebrated all over Malaysia?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, everywhere! But in my hometown, it is... um... more special because many family stay together.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really nice. I’d love to experience it someday.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You must come! We will prepare many food for you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you, Farah! I’m excited just thinking about it.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You’re welcome! Next time, I will tell you more about other holiday.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that. Thanks for sharing, Farah. Have a great day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! You too. Have a nice day!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, Farah.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** See you later! Let’s continue next time.
