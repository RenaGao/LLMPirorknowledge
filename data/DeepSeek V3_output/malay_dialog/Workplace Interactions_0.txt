**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah. How’s the progress on the report for the client?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, hello. The report is almost finish. I need to check some data... um, how to say, to make sure it is correct.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good. Are there any issues you’re facing?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not big issue, but I need more time for, uh... the detail part. Maybe one more day?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, no problem. We need to submit it by Friday, so you have two more days. Is that enough?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes, enough. I will make sure it is ready before Friday.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What about the presentation slides? Have you started on those?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not yet. I focus on report first. But I will start the slides tomorrow.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, sounds good. Let me know if you need any help with the slides.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. Maybe I need help with... um, the design? I not so good with that.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, I can assist with the design. Just send me the content when it’s ready.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will send it to you once I finish.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Anything else we need to discuss?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think that’s all for now. I keep working on the report and slides.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, good luck with it. Let’s touch base tomorrow to check progress.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, sure. See you tomorrow. Thank you for your help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Have a good day, Farah!
