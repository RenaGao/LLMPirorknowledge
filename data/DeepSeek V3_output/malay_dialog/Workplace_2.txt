**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, welcome to the team! I’m Sarah. Let me explain your first task.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello, thank you, Sarah. I’m Hafiz. Nice to meet you. Okay, I ready to hear the task.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Your first task is to organize the client files in the shared drive. Do you know how to use it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Shared drive? Is it the... um, folder for everyone to use?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly! It’s where all team members can access and update files.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I see. So, I need to arrange the files? How to do it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! You’ll create folders for each client and move their documents into the correct folder. Make sure to label them clearly.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, okay. So, client name for folder, and all their paper inside?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s right! For example, create a folder named “ABC Company” and put all their files there.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I understand. But, um, if there are many files, how to know which one belong to who?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! You can check the file names—they usually include the client’s name. If you’re unsure, just ask me.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, got it. I will try to do it. If I have problem, I will ask you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Don’t worry if it takes time—this is your first day.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, Sarah. I feel more confident now. When is the... um, when must I finish?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s say by the end of the day tomorrow. Does that work for you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, tomorrow is enough, I think. I will try my best.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you’ll do great! Let me know if you need anything else.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, Sarah. Thank you for explaining very clear. I will start now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Looking forward to seeing the organized files. Have a great day, Hafiz!  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, Sarah. You too, have a nice day!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Hafiz! Let’s catch up tomorrow.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Goodbye, Sarah! See you tomorrow.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, and good luck with the task!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, I will do my best. See you again!
