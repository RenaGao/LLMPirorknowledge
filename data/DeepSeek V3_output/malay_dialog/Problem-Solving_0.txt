**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Farah, I was wondering if I upset you the other day during our group chat. You seemed quiet after I made that comment.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, no, it’s okay. I just… um, how to say… I feel confused. I not sure what you mean.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. I was just joking about the project deadline, but I didn’t mean to make it sound serious. Did you think I was criticizing you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, a little. I thought maybe you say I am slow. So, I feel… um, how to say… not good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, I’m really sorry if it came across that way. It was just a joke, and I didn’t mean to make you feel bad. You’re doing great with the project.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, John. I understand now. Sometimes I not get joke in English. My mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** No, it’s not your fault. I should have been clearer. Let’s make sure we’re on the same page next time, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, okay. I will ask if I not sure. Thank you for explain to me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, Farah. I’m glad we talked about this. By the way, how are you finding the project so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It is good, but sometimes I feel stress. Many thing to do, and I worry I make mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s normal. Just let me know if you need help. We’re a team, after all.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, thank you, John. I feel better now. You are very kind.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m happy to help. Let’s catch up again soon, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, sure. I will see you next week. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Farah. Take care and see you soon!
