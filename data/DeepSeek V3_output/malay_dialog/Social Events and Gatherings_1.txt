**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! I’m so glad you’re here. We need to plan a surprise party for Aiman. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, surprise party for Aiman? That is... um, very good idea! I think we can make it at his house. Or maybe... um, in restaurant?

**Speaker A (NS):** His house sounds great. It’s more personal. What do you think we should do for decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I think we can use balloons and... um, that thing for party... uh, banner? Yes, banner with his name.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! A banner with "Happy Birthday, Aiman!" What about food? Any suggestions?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, Aiman like nasi lemak very much. We can order from... um, the shop near his house. And maybe cake also.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! I’ll order the cake. Do you think we should invite his other friends too?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think so. Maybe... um, 10 people? Not too many, but enough for fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. I’ll make a list and send them invites. How about games? Should we plan something?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! We can play that game where you guess the song. Aiman like music very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice! I’ll prepare the questions. Now, what time should everyone arrive?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Aiman usually come home at 6 p.m. So maybe 5 p.m. for us to prepare?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good plan. I’ll tell everyone to come at 5 p.m. sharp. Have you thought about a gift for Aiman?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think... um, maybe we can buy him new shoes. His old ones... uh, already break.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s thoughtful. I’ll pitch in for the shoes. Anything else we’re missing?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think... um, music? We can make a playlist with his favorite songs.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent idea. I’ll take care of the playlist. So, to summarize, we’re doing it at his house with decorations, nasi lemak, cake, games, and a gift. Does that sound right?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is all. I think Aiman will be very happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure he will. Thanks for your help, Farah. Let’s meet again next week to finalize everything. 

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, thank you too. I will see you next week. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Farah! Take care!
