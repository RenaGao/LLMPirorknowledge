**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! How’s your preparation for the upcoming exam going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, hello! My preparation... um, it’s okay, but I feel a bit worried. There is so many thing to study.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. What subjects are you most concerned about?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I worry for math. The formula is very... how to say... complicated. And also, history. Too many date to remember.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Math can be tricky. Are you practicing past year questions?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I try. But sometimes I cannot understand the question. Maybe I need more practice.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. For history, maybe try making a timeline. It helps to see the dates in order.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, that’s... um, sounds good. I will try. Thank you for the suggestion.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Do you have a study group or someone to discuss with?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, my friend Aiman and I sometimes study together. But he also busy with his own study.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s still helpful. Maybe you can share notes with him. It’s good to have support.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we share note. But I think I need more time to... uh, review everything.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Time management is key. Try making a schedule for each subject.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will make schedule. Thank you for your advice. It makes me feel better.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Just keep practicing, and you’ll do fine. Don’t stress too much.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will try my best. If I have problem again, can I ask you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I’m happy to help. Good luck with your studies!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you very much. Good luck for you also! I will see you later.  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, Farah!
