**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Rina! Thank you for coming to talk with me today. Is everything okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, yes… but I want to say sorry, Mr. John. I make mistake with the report.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. What kind of mistake? Can you explain?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** The numbers, they are not correct. I… how to say… I mix up the data.

**Speaker A (NS):** You mixed up the data? Do you know how it happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think because I hurry too much. I not check properly before send.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Mistakes happen, especially when we’re rushing. Do you have a plan to fix it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I already correct the numbers. And now I double-check everything before send.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good! Double-checking is very important. I’m glad you took care of it.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, Mr. John. I feel very sorry about this.

**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry too much. What’s important is you fixed it and learned from it. Just take your time next time.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will. I promise to be more careful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, no, I think that’s all. Thank you for understanding, Mr. John.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, Rina. Thank you for being honest about it. Let’s move forward and make sure it doesn’t happen again.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will. Thank you again, Mr. John. Have a good day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Rina. Take care, and see you later!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, see you later!
