**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Amin! I heard you’re from Malaysia. I’m curious, how is dining etiquette different there compared to, say, the U.S.?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! In Malaysia, we always eat with our right hand. Left hand is... um, how to say... not polite.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Why is that?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** In my culture, left hand is for... um, cleaning, not for eating. So right hand is better. And also, we must not point our feet to the food or people. It is rude.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting! What about sharing food?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we share food! Always. Everyone sit together and take food from same plate. It is... how to say... bonding time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I love that idea. Do you have any special rules for guests?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes. When guest come, we always offer food and drink. If not, it is... um, not good. Guest must feel welcome.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so considerate. Do you ever eat with utensils?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes. If we eat rice with curry, we use spoon and fork. But for some food like nasi lemak, we use hand. It is more... um, authentic.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. What about finishing your food? Is it polite to leave some on the plate?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, no. We must finish food. If not, it mean we don’t like it. And that is... um, not good. Host may feel sad.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. How about tipping? Do you tip in restaurants?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Tipping? Not common in Malaysia. But some place, like tourist area, they accept. But we don’t worry so much for tipping.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to know. It’s fascinating how different cultures approach dining. Thanks for sharing, Amin!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You are welcome! It is... um, nice for me to explain my culture.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I learned a lot. Let’s catch up again soon!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure! See you next time. Have a good day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Amin! Take care.
