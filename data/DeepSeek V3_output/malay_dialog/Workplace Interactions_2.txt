**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Rina, welcome to the team! Can I explain how to handle customer inquiries?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, please. I want to learn... um, how to do it.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! First, when a customer calls, you need to greet them politely. Say something like, "Good morning, thank you for calling. How can I help you?"
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I understand. But if I don’t know the answer, what to do?
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s okay. You can say, "Let me check on that for you," and then transfer the call to someone who knows.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I see. And if the customer is angry? How to handle?
**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. Stay calm and listen to their concern. Then, apologize and say, "I’m sorry for the inconvenience. Let me see how we can fix this."
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will try. Sometimes I worry my English is not so good.
**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry! Your English is fine. Just take your time, and customers will appreciate your effort.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. This is very helpful. I will practice.
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s the spirit! Let me know if you have any other questions, okay? Welcome to the team, Rina!
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, thank you. I feel more confident now. See you later!
**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, Rina!
