**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! I heard you’re planning a group vacation. Do you have any ideas for the destination?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, hello! Yes, I think about it. Maybe we can go to island? I hear about Langkawi. Very beautiful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Langkawi sounds great! What activities can we do there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, we can do... like, swim in sea. And also, there is cable car, for see the view. Very nice.  
**Speaker A (NS):** A cable car sounds fun! Do you think everyone in the group will enjoy that?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think so. Also, there is shopping place. My friend say it is cheap and good to buy... um, thing for memory?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Souvenirs?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! Souvenirs. I think it is good for everyone.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! How about food?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, the food is... um, how to say... very delicious! Seafood, especially. We must try.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I love seafood! How long should we stay there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe four days? Enough to see everything and relax.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a good plan. Should we book a hotel or a homestay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think hotel is better. More easy for all of us.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. I’ll check for some options and share them with the group.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Good idea! Thank you for help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let’s finalize the details later.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, sure. I will ask the group for their opinion too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! See you soon, Farah.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** See you soon! We will have a fun vacation, I think.
