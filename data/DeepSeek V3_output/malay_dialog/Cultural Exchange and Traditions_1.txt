**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! I was curious—what are some dining customs in Malaysia? I’ve heard they’re quite different from Western ones.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! In Malaysia, we usually eat with hand. But only the right hand, because left hand is... um, how to say... not clean?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, interesting! Is it considered impolite to use your left hand?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, very impolite. Also, we must wash hand before eat. Very important.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. What about sharing food? Do you eat from one plate?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we share food. Like, many dishes in middle, and everyone take with spoon or hand. But no use our own spoon to take from big plate—must use serving spoon.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. That’s similar to some Western family-style meals. What do Malaysians think about finishing all the food on your plate?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, it is polite to finish food. But if you full, it’s okay to leave a little. But better to take small portion first, then take more if you want.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s practical! Are there any customs around drinks during meals?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we always have drink like water or tea. But we don’t drink during eat—it is better to drink after eating.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I didn’t know that! What’s the reason?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think it help digestion. Also, it’s polite to pour drink for others before yourself.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s thoughtful. Are there any other rules I should know?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes. Don’t put your hand in the rice bowl—it look like disrespect. And must wait for older person to start eating first.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really respectful. It’s fascinating how much etiquette varies across cultures!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, every culture have different way. I like to learn Western dining custom too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! It’s a great way to understand each other better. Thanks for sharing, Farah—this was really helpful.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You’re welcome! Happy to share. Next time, I can teach you how to eat with hand.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like fun! I’ll practice before then. See you soon, Farah!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** See you later! Thank you for listening.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Farah. Let’s meet again soon!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, I will look forward to it. Have a good day!
