**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sarah! We need to plan a birthday surprise for Emma. Do you have any ideas?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! Maybe we can make a party in her... um, how to say... place she live?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Her apartment? That’s a good idea! Should we decorate it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, decorate with balloons and... uh, thing that makes light?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Fairy lights? That would look nice!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, fairy lights! And maybe we can cook her... um, favorite food?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What does she like to eat?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think she like pasta and... um, cake.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll handle the pasta, and you can get the cake?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I can buy cake. But... what time we do the surprise?  
**Speaker A (NS):** How about 7 p.m.? She usually gets home around then.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okey, 7 p.m. is good. Can we also make... um, video for her?  
**Speaker A (NS):** A video? Like a montage of messages from her friends?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, montage! I can ask her friends to... um, record message.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a lovely idea! I’ll help you organize it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! So, we have decorate, food, and video. Anything else?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I think that’s perfect. Let’s meet tomorrow to finalize the details.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okey, meet tomorrow. See you then!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow! Let’s make this a great surprise for Emma!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, she will be very happy. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Sarah!
