**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How’s it going?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi! I’m good, thank you. And you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing great! So, I was wondering, what’s your favorite movie?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, my favorite movie is... um... how to say... “Fast and Furious.” I like it because it’s... exciting and have many action.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I love that series too! The car chases are so thrilling. Which part of the series is your favorite?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think... part 7? Because... it’s very touching. You know, the ending about Paul Walker.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s such a heartfelt tribute. Do you watch a lot of action movies?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I like action, but also sometimes... um... romantic movie? Like, “Crazy Rich Asian.” It’s... funny and nice story.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s a great one! The cast is amazing, and the humor is so good. What about TV shows? Do you have a favorite?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! I like... uhh... “Breaking Bad.” The story is very... intense. And the acting is... um... very good.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a classic! Walter White’s character development is so fascinating. Do you like other drama shows?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm... I also watch “Money Heist.” It’s... very exciting and have many... uh... plot twists.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard about that! It’s really popular. Do you prefer watching shows alone or with friends?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like to watch with friends, because we can... um... discuss the story after. But sometimes, I watch alone if the show is... serious.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. It’s fun to share opinions with friends. So, would you recommend “Breaking Bad” to me?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think you will like it! It’s... very interesting and keep you... um... thinking.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll definitely check it out. Thanks for the suggestion!  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You’re welcome! And thank you also for talk about movies.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! It was really nice chatting with you. Let’s do this again sometime.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, sure! Nice to talk with you. See you later!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you! Take care!
