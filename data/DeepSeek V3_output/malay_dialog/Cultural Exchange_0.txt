**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, can you tell me about a festival or tradition from your country? I’m really curious to learn more about Malaysia!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes. In Malaysia, we have many festival, but one very popular is Hari Raya Aidilfitri. It is after Ramadan, the fasting month.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of Ramadan. So, Hari Raya is like the celebration after that?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, exactly! We celebrate after one month fasting. It is very big and happy time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing. What do people usually do during Hari Raya?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, we wear new clothes, usually traditional one called baju kurung or baju Melayu. And we visit family and friends.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s nice. Do you invite people to your home too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we open house. We prepare many food, like ketupat, rendang, and lemang. Everyone is welcome to eat.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that sounds delicious! What’s your favorite part of the festival?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like the... um, how to say... the togetherness. Everyone is happy, and we forgive each other for past mistakes.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really beautiful. So, it’s a time for family and forgiveness.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, exactly. Also, we give money to children in small packet called duit raya. They like it very much!  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so interesting! It sounds like a lot of fun. Are there any decorations or special activities?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we put up oil lamp called pelita and decorate house with lights. Sometimes, there is also cultural performance, like music and dance.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to experience that someday. Thanks for explaining it to me.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You’re welcome! If you come to Malaysia during Hari Raya, I invite you to my house.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so kind of you! I’ll definitely take you up on that offer.
