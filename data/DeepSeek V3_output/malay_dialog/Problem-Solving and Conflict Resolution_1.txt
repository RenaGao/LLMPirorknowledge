**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I heard you’re having trouble with your internet service. What seems to be the problem?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, ah... my internet, it is very slow. Like... uh, how to say... loading take too long.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds frustrating. How long has it been like this?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, maybe two days. I try to restart the... um, the thing for internet.  
**Speaker A (NS):** The router?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, router! I restart it, but still no change.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Have you contacted your service provider about this?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not yet. I don’t know how to... um, explain to them.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay! You can tell them exactly what you told me. Or would you like me to help you draft a message?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, please help. I write, but maybe... grammar not good.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let’s write: “My internet has been very slow for the past two days. I restarted my router, but it’s still slow. Can you help me fix this?”  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, that is good. Thank you!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. If they don’t respond, you can call their customer service.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Call? Oh, I scared... my English is not so good for call.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s okay to ask them to speak slowly. They’ll help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I try. Thank you so much for helping me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No worries at all. Let me know if you need more help. Good luck!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will. Thank you again. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Bye! Take care!
