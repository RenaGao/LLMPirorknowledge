**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Nice to meet you. Are you here to discuss your exercise routine?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, sir. Thank you for meeting. I want... um, to be more healthy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! What kind of activities do you enjoy?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like walking. Sometimes, I go to gym, but... um, how to say... not often.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. How about setting a goal to visit the gym twice a week?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Twice a week? Hmm, I think... can try. But I worry about time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Let’s start small—maybe 30 minutes per session.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, 30 minutes... I think can do. What exercise I should do there?  
**Speaker A (NS):** A mix of cardio and strength training. For example, 15 minutes on the treadmill and 15 minutes with weights.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Treadmill is easy. But weights... I afraid I do wrong.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! I can show you the correct form during our sessions.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, thank you! That make me feel... um, better.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Glad to hear it! What’s your long-term fitness goal?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I want to lose... um, how to say... weight? And also have more... energy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Combining exercise and a balanced diet will help with both.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Diet? I think I need to eat more... healthy food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! More veggies and lean proteins, fewer processed foods.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I will try. Thank you for your advice.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let’s meet again next week to check your progress.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, thank you. See you next week!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Looking forward to it. Take care until then!
