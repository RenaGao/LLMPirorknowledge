**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sarah! I’ve been meaning to talk to you about something. Did you get my message about canceling our plans last weekend?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Uh, yes, I got your message. But actually, I feel a bit... uh, how to say... confused. I thought we agreed to meet.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’m sorry if it wasn’t clear. I sent you a text saying I couldn’t make it because of work. Did you not see it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, maybe I miss it. I check phone later, but I see nothing. So I wait for you, but you not come.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, I’m really sorry about that. I thought I sent it early enough, but maybe it didn’t go through. That’s my fault.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It’s okay. I just feel... um, sad because I think you forget me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I would never forget about you! You’re one of my closest friends. This was just a mix-up with the message.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I understand now. Maybe next time, we can confirm... um, double-check?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. I’ll make sure to follow up with a call next time, just in case.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. It will make me feel... uh, more sure.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I’ll do better next time. How about we plan something this weekend to make up for it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That sounds good. I am free on Saturday.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let’s meet at the usual café at noon. Does that work for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, noon is okay. I will be there.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’m looking forward to it. And sorry again for the confusion last weekend.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No problem. I am happy we talk and clear this... uh, misunderstanding.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Thanks for being understanding. See you on Saturday then!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, see you on Saturday. Have a good day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Take care.
