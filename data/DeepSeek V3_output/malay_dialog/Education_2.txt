**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah. Do you have a moment? I wanted to ask about the homework assignment.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, teacher. I can talk now. What is the... um, problem?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m a bit confused about question number three. Can you explain it again?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, question three. It is about... how to say... the thing for making water clean.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You mean water purification?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes! Water purification. You need to explain the... um, steps. The steps to clean the water.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so I need to describe the process of water purification?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, teacher. But not too long. Just... the important steps. Like, first, you take the dirt out. Then, you add... um, chemical?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So sediment removal first, then chemical treatment?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that’s it. You understand now?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that makes sense. Thank you for explaining. One more thing—how long should the answer be?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not too long. Maybe... one page? But focus on the main steps. Is that okay?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect. I think I can do it now. Thanks so much for your help!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You’re welcome, teacher. If you have more questions, just ask.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I will. Have a good day, Farah!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too, teacher. See you in class tomorrow!  

The conversation ends with both speakers expressing goodbye and confirming the summary of the discussion.
