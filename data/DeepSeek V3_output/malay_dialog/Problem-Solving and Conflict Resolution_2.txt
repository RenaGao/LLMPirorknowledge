**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aini! I think we need to discuss the problem with the project timeline. Do you have some ideas on how to fix it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, ya. I think the problem is... um, we have many task but not enough time. Maybe we can... how to say... divide the work?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. If we divide the tasks, we can finish faster. Which part would you like to take?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I can do the... data thing. The, uh, collecting and checking data. But I need help with the report writing.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I can handle the report. Let’s also set deadlines for each task. Does that work for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Can we make first deadline... um, next Tuesday? I need time to check everything.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Tuesday sounds good. How about we meet on Monday to check progress?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that’s good idea. I think we can do like this.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Also, if you need any help with the data, let me know. We can work together.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I will ask if I have any... um, difficulties.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! One more thing—should we update the team about this plan?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, we should tell them. Maybe we can send email?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll draft the email and share it with you before sending it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, thank you. I think this plan will work.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I agree. Let’s start tomorrow and see how it goes.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, tomorrow we start. Thank you for helping me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Aini. Let’s meet on Monday, then. Have a great evening!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, have a nice evening too. See you on Monday!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Aini. Goodbye!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Goodbye, see you soon!  

The conversation ends with both speakers agreeing on the plan and expressing goodwill.
