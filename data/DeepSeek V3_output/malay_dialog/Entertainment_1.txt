**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! How are you doing today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I’m doing good, thank you. How about you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m great, thanks! So, I was thinking, we should plan an evening out this weekend. What do you think?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That sounds very nice! I also want to go out. Where we can go?  

**Speaker A (NS):** How about we start with dinner? Do you have any favorite restaurants?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, I like that place, uh, how to say… near the park? They have good nasi lemak.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the one by Central Park? I’ve heard their food is great. Let’s go there! What time should we meet?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe at 7 p.m.? Is okay for you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, 7 p.m. works perfectly. After dinner, should we do something else?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, maybe we can go for… um, what you call it… walk around?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, a stroll? That’s a great idea! The park should be lovely in the evening.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I like walk in park. It’s very peaceful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed! And if we’re up for it, we could grab dessert afterward.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I like that! Maybe we can eat… uh, ais kacang?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Ice kacang? Sure, that sounds refreshing!  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, it is very nice. So, we meet at 7 p.m. for dinner, then walk, then eat ais kacang?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Sounds like a perfect evening.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I very excited! Thank you for planning.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you too! I’ll see you at 7 p.m. on Saturday, then.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, see you on Saturday! Bye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Aiman!
