**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I’m curious, is there a skill you’ve been wanting to learn recently?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes. I want to learn how to cook. It is... important for me because I need to take care of myself.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great skill to have! What kind of dishes do you want to learn?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I want to learn Malay dish, like nasi lemak and rendang. But also... um, how to say... international food?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, international cuisine? Like Italian or Japanese food?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes! Italian pizza and Japanese sushi. I think it is good to know many food.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. Cooking different cuisines can be really fun. Do you have any experience in cooking so far?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** A little bit. I know how to fry egg and cook rice. But I never try more difficult dish.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start! Do you have someone who can teach you, or will you learn by yourself?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** My mother, she is good cook. But she is far away now. So I think I will... um, learn from video on internet.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. There are so many cooking tutorials online. Do you have a plan to start soon?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe next week. I already bought some... um, ingredient... for nasi lemak.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s exciting! I’m sure you’ll do great. Cooking can be very rewarding once you get the hang of it.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I hope so. And also, it is cheaper than eating outside.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true. Plus, you can control what goes into your food. It’s healthier too.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, health is important. I think I will feel more... um, confident if I can cook well.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you will! It’s a skill that’s useful for life. Good luck with your cooking journey!
