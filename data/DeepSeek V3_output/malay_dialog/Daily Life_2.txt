**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! So, you mentioned you’re excited to cook for us. What’s your favorite meal to prepare?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! I like cook nasi lemak. It is... um, Malay food. Very famous in my country.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Nasi lemak? I’ve heard of it but never tried it. What’s in it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It is rice. Cook with... uh, coconut milk. And have sambal chili, cucumber, fried egg, and... um, anchovies.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! How do you make the rice?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** First, you wash rice. Then, you cook with coconut milk, and... uh, little bit salt. Also, you put pandan leaf for smell.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Pandan leaf? What’s that?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It is green leaf. Very nice smell. We use often in cooking.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. And the sambal chili? Is it spicy?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, very spicy! You fry chili, onion, garlic, and... um, shrimp paste. Mix all together.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds intense! Do you need any special ingredients?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe... um, the shrimp paste. It is... uh, how to say, belacan. But other things easy to find.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I think I’ve seen shrimp paste at the store. How about the fried egg and anchovies?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Very simple. Just fry egg like usual. And anchovies, you fry until crispy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** This is so interesting! How about we cook it together this weekend?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, good idea! I can show you step by step.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Should we make a shopping list?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I write down what we need. Rice, coconut milk, pandan leaf, chili, onion, garlic, shrimp paste, egg, and anchovies.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. I’ll pick up the ingredients tomorrow.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I sure you will like nasi lemak.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure I will too. Looking forward to it!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, we cook together on Saturday. See you then!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds great. See you on Saturday!
