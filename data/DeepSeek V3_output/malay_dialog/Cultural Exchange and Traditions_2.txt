**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thanks for meeting with me today. I’d like to hear your ideas about planning a cultural event to share your traditions.  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** Oh, thank you. I am very happy to share. I think we can make event about food and... um, traditional dance.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! What kind of food would you like to include?  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** Maybe we can have nasi lemak... it is our popular rice dish. And also, satay—it is meat on stick, very delicious.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of satay! That’s a great idea. And what about the dance?  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** We can show zapin dance. It is traditional dance for Malay people. Very beautiful and... um, how to say... energetic.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds exciting! Where do you think we should hold the event?  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** Maybe in community hall? It is big enough for dance and food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. Do you think we should invite other communities to join?  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** Yes, good idea. We can invite many people to... um, how to say... learn about our culture.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. How can we spread the word about the event?  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** We can use social media... like Facebook and Instagram. And also, maybe posters in... uh, public places.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great plan. Do you think we should have a theme for the event?  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** Yes, maybe theme is "Malay Heritage Day." It is... um, easy to understand for everyone.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I like that! What date are you thinking of?  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** Maybe on Saturday, 20th November. It is near to Hari Raya... um, our festival.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s write that down. Do you think we need volunteers?  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** Yes, we need people to help with food, dance, and also... um, decorating the hall.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Should we meet again next week to finalize the details?  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** Yes, next week is good for me. I will prepare more ideas.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Thanks for sharing your thoughts today. See you next week.  
**Speaker B (Malay L2):** Thank you too! See you next week, and we will make a great event.
