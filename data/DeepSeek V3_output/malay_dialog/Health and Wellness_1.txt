**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! How’s it going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It’s okay. Busy with work. But I feel, um, sometimes tired.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, that’s not good. Have you been looking after your health?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not so much. I don’t have time, always working.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand, but it’s important to take care of yourself. Maybe you can try small changes?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes. Like what?  
**Speaker A (NS):** For example, drinking more water and eating healthy food. Do you eat fruits and vegetables?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sometimes, but not much. Always eat fast food. Very easy and quick.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Maybe you can cook simple meals at home? It’s healthier and cheaper too.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, maybe I can try. But I don’t know how to... cook well.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay. You can start with easy recipes. I can send you some links if you want.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, please. That is helpful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And don’t forget to exercise. Even just a short walk can make a difference.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, walk is okay for me. I will try to walk more in the... evening.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And make sure to get enough sleep too. How many hours do you usually sleep?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe 5 or 6. Always wake up early and sleep late.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s not enough. Try to sleep at least 7 hours. It’s important for your body.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I will try. Thank you for your advice. It is very... how to say... useful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I’m happy to help. Let’s talk again next week and see how you’re doing.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay. Yes, I will... um, follow your advice. Thank you again!  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Take care, Farah!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too. Bye!  

**End of conversation:** Speaker A and Speaker B conclude the conversation with a friendly goodbye and a summary of their agreement.
