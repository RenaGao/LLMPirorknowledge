**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How are you doing today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How about you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks! I hear you’ve got something exciting to share. What’s your recent achievement?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! Actually, I... um, finish my English course last month.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, congratulations! That’s a big accomplishment. How long did it take?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It take... um, six month. I study every week, but it is... um, what is the word... ah, challenging!  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s understandable. English can be tough, but you did it! What was the hardest part for you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think... grammar is hard. Sometimes I say, “He have” instead of “He has.”  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a common mistake, but you’re improving. What does finishing the course mean to you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It mean... um, I have more confident now. I can talk to people in English. Before, I always... how to say... afraid to make mistake.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fantastic! Confidence is so important. What’s next for you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I want to... um, practice more. Maybe join English club or watch more English movie.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! Movies are a fun way to learn. Do you have a favorite so far?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like “The Avengers.” The story is... um, exciting, and the English is not too fast.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice choice! Action movies are engaging. Well, I’m really proud of you. Anything else you’d like to share?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Just... thank you for listening. I feel happy to share with you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! It was great hearing about your achievement. Keep up the amazing work.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I will try my best.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let’s catch up again soon.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I hope so. Goodbye!
