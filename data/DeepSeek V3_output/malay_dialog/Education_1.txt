**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for joining our study group today! Do you understand the topic we’re discussing about climate change?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, thank you. Um, I know a little bit, but it is... how to say... confusing for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! What part is confusing? Maybe I can help explain.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think... the thing about carbon, um, carbon dioxide? How it makes the Earth become hotter.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, yes. So, carbon dioxide is a gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. When there’s too much, it causes global warming. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Global warming, yes. But why is carbon dioxide increasing? From where it come?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. It comes from burning fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and gas. For example, cars and factories produce a lot of carbon dioxide.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I see. So, cars and factories make the gas, and then the gas make the Earth hotter. But how to stop it?

**Speaker A (NS):** We can try using cleaner energy, like solar or wind power, and reduce using cars. Recycling also helps.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Solar and wind... okay. But I think it is difficult for many people to change, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it’s a big challenge. But small steps, like using less plastic or planting trees, can make a difference over time.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Plant trees? Why trees important?

**Speaker A (NS):** Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. So, they help reduce the gas in the air.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I understand now. Trees are like... natural cleaner for the air. That is good to know.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Do you feel more clear about climate change now?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, much more clear. Thank you for explaining. I will try to do small things to help.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Every little bit helps. Thanks for being part of the discussion.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you also. I hope we can talk more next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure thing! See you later. Take care!  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** See you later, and thank you again!
