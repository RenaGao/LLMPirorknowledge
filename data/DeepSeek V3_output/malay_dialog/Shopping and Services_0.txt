**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can you help me find something?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, of course. What thing you are looking for?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m not sure. Maybe something for a gift? Do you have any suggestions?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Gift, ah. You want for man or woman?  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s for my sister. She likes cooking.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, for cooking, we have many... um, how to say... tools? Like... cutter, mixer, and... ah, thing for making cake.  
**Speaker A (NS):** A cake mixer? That might be nice.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, cake mixer. This one is very good. Many people buy. They say it is... um, strong and easy to use.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. How much is it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It is RM 150. Oh, I mean, 150 ringgit.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Do you have it in different colors?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we have red, blue, and... uh, silver. Which one you like?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I think the silver one would be great.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will take it for you. You want gift wrapping?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, please. That would be wonderful.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No problem. It will take... um, five minutes. You can wait here.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’ll wait. Thank you so much for your help!
