**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Do you need some help? You look a bit lost.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, thank you. I... um, trying to find hotel nearby. Do you know where it is?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Which hotel are you looking for?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** The one called... um, how to say... "Sunset View Hotel." Is it near here?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Sunset View Hotel? Yes, it’s not too far. Are you walking or driving?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I walk. It is okay if not too far.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, so you need to go straight down this road for about two blocks. Then turn left at the traffic light.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Straight... then left at traffic light?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. After that, you’ll see a big bookstore on your right. The hotel is just behind it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Big bookstore on the... uh, right? Then hotel is behind?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right! You can’t miss it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you so much! Uh, is it safe to walk there?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it’s a safe area. Just be mindful of the traffi—oh, wait, actually, there’s a shortcut.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Shortcut? Where?  
**Speaker A (NS):** If you take the first right instead of going straight, you’ll see a small park. Walk through it, and it’ll save you some time.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Small park... okay, I try that. Thank you again!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Do you want me to write it down for you, just in case?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, please. That would be... um, very helpful.  
**Speaker A (NS):** (Writes down the directions) Here you go. Just follow this, and you’ll be there in no time.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you so much. You are very kind.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Enjoy your stay at the hotel!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will. Thank you and good day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good day to you too! Take care, and have a wonderful trip.
