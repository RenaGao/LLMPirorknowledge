**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you part of the study group for the biology class?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I am. I think I need some help to understand the photosynthesis topic.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. So, photosynthesis is the process where plants make their own food using sunlight. Do you know what chlorophyll is?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Chlorophyll? Hmm, is it something that... um, makes the plant green color?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Chlorophyll is the green pigment in plants that captures sunlight. It’s a key part of photosynthesis. Does that make sense so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think so. But how the sunlight change into... um, food for the plant?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great question! The sunlight provides energy. This energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The plant uses the hydrogen to make glucose, which is its food.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I see. So, sunlight give energy, and then... uh, the plant make glucose. What happen to the oxygen?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good point! The oxygen is released into the air. That’s why plants are so important—they give us oxygen to breathe.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I understand now. So, plant take in... um, water and sunlight, and give out oxygen. Like a kind of... factory?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s a perfect way to describe it! It’s like a factory producing glucose and oxygen. Do you feel more confident about this now?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, thank you. Your explanation is very clear. I think I can answer the questions in the book now.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear! Let me know if you need help with anything else. Good luck with your studies!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you so much. I will try my best. See you in class later!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! See you later, and have a good day!
