Hello! Thank you for calling XYZ Electronics Customer Service. How can I assist you today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
Ah, yes, hello. I want to tell about... uh, problem with my recent purchase.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
Of course. I’m here to help. Can you tell me what the issue is?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
I buy laptop last week, but now... um, the screen... it become black. Cannot see anything.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
I’m sorry to hear that. Did the screen suddenly go black, or was there something you did before it happened?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
Suddenly. I just open laptop, but no screen. Only black.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
I see. Did you try charging it or restarting it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
Yes, I try. I charge, and I press the... um, power button long time, but still no change.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
Okay, thank you for trying that. It sounds like there might be an issue with the display. Do you still have the receipt or order number?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**  
Yes, I have receipt. I... um, keep it safe.  

**Speaker A (NS):**
