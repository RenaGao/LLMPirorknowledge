**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! I heard you’re planning a trip with your friends. Where are you thinking of going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! We want go to Penang. Many friends say it is very... um, how to say... interesting place.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Penang? That’s a great choice! It’s famous for its food and culture. Are you excited?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, very excited! We plan to visit... um, many famous... how to say... places? Like temples and beaches.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Have you decided where to stay yet?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We think stay in Georgetown. It is... um, central and easy to go everywhere.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea. Georgetown has a lot to offer. How are you getting there?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We will take bus. It is... um, cheaper than fly.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. How long will you stay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Three days. Friday to Sunday. Is that enough?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Three days should be fine. You’ll have time to explore. What’s the first thing you’ll do when you arrive?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** First, we want to eat! Penang food is... um, very famous. Like... char kuey teow.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I love char kuey teow! You’ll have a great time trying the food. What about activities?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe visit Kek Lok Si temple and... um, how to say... ride bicycle at Penang Hill.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. Have you thought about the budget?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we decide each person bring RM500. For food, stay, and... um, transport.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a reasonable budget. It seems like you’ve planned well.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I hope everything will be... um, smooth.  
**Speaker A (NS):** It will be. Just make sure to check the weather forecast before you go.  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! Good idea. I will check it. Thank you for your advice!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Have a fantastic trip!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I will tell you about it when I come back. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Farah! Safe travels.
