**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! How’s your morning going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, morning is good. I wake up early, around 6.30. Then, I... um, take shower and eat breakfast.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds productive! What do you usually have for breakfast?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Usually I eat nasi lemak or bread with... uh, thing for spreading, like jam or butter.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, jam or butter on bread? That’s simple and nice. Do you drink coffee or tea?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I drink tea. Coffee sometime, but tea is more... uh, my favorite.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Tea is great for starting the day. What do you do after breakfast?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** After, I... um, prepare for work. I wear clothes and check my... uh, bag to make sure nothing missing.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s smart. Do you take public transport to work?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I take LRT. It is... uh, train for going to office. Sometimes it is crowded.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine. Crowded trains can be tiring. How long does it take to get to your office?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Around 30 minute. But if traffic, maybe 45. I always try to leave early.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good habit. So, your mornings seem pretty busy! Do you have any time to relax before work?  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes. If I have time, I read news or listen music. But not too much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice. It’s good to have a little moment for yourself. Thanks for sharing your routine!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No problem. You also have busy morning?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I do! I usually go for a run before breakfast. Anyway, I have to get going now. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, thank you! Have a nice day too!
