**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m looking for a new book to read. Do you have any recommendations?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, I have one. It is called... *The Kite Runner*. You know this book?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve heard of it, but I haven’t read it. What’s it about?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It is about... um, how to say... two boys in Afghanistan. Their friendship, and... ah, the difficult things they face.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting. Why do you think I should read it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Because the story is very... touching. It make you feel many emotion. I cry when I read it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, it must be powerful. Is it easy to read, or is the language a bit heavy?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, not so difficult. The words are clear, but the story is deep. I think you can understand it well.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to know. Did you learn anything from the book?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I learn about... how to say... the importance of friends and family. And also, how life can change very fast.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really meaningful. Thank you for recommending it!  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You’re welcome! I hope you like it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll definitely give it a try. Do you think I can find it in a bookstore, or should I buy it online?  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I think you can find in bookstore. But online also many people sell it. Maybe cheaper.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. I’ll check both options.  

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Good idea. Let me know if you read it, okay?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I will. Thanks again for the recommendation.
