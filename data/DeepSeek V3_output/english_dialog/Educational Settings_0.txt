**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Mr. Thompson, do you have a moment to chat about the history assignment?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Sure thing, Sarah. What’s on your mind?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m a little confused about the essay prompt. Could you clarify what you mean by “analyze the long-term effects of the Industrial Revolution”?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Ah, got it. So, I’m asking you to look beyond the immediate changes and focus on how it shaped society, economy, and technology over decades. Does that make sense?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sort of, but I’m not entirely sure where to start. Are there specific areas you’d like us to focus on?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Hmm, good question. You could explore urbanization, labor laws, or even how it influenced modern capitalism. It’s really up to you—choose something that interests you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That helps, thanks. I was a bit stuck on how narrow or broad I should go.  

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem. I’d say keep it focused but not too narrow. For example, you could look at how child labor laws evolved as a direct result.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. I think I’ll go with that. Also, how long should the essay be?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Around 1,000 words should do the trick. Just make sure it’s well-structured and supported by evidence.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. And can I use outside sources, or should I stick to the textbook?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Outside sources are fine, as long as they’re credible. Don’t forget to cite them properly.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Will do. Thanks so much for clearing that up—I was feeling a bit overwhelmed.  

**Speaker B (NS):** No worries at all, Sarah. That’s what I’m here for. Let me know if you hit any other snags.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I will. You’ve been a huge help. Have a great rest of your day!  

**Speaker B (NS):** You too, Sarah. Good luck with the essay—I’m sure you’ll do great!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks! See you in class.  

**Speaker B (NS):** See you then. Take care!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Mr. Thompson!  

**Speaker B (NS):** Goodbye, Sarah!
