**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sarah! Have you started studying for the biology test next week?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Ugh, not really. I keep putting it off, but I know I need to get my act together. How about you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve started, but I’m a bit all over the place. I feel like I’m trying to cram a mountain of information into a tiny backpack, you know?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Totally get that. Maybe we could study together? Two heads are better than one, right?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! I was actually going to suggest that. When are you free?  

**Speaker B (NS):** How about Saturday afternoon? I’m free after lunch.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. We can meet at the library—quiet and no distractions.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good. Do you have any specific study tips? I’m kind of lost on where to start.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I usually start by going through the lecture notes and highlighting the key points. Then, I make flashcards for the tricky terms. It’s a grind, but it works.  

**Speaker B (NS):** That makes sense. I’ve heard summarizing each chapter in your own words helps, too. Maybe we could try that together?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. And we could quiz each other on the material. Sometimes explaining it out loud helps it stick.  

**Speaker B (NS):** True. I always feel like I understand it better when I talk it through.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here. Oh, and don’t forget to take breaks. Cramming for hours on end is a recipe for burnout.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Good point. Maybe we could do the Pomodoro technique—25 minutes of studying, then a 5-minute break.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m all for that. Breaks are lifesavers. Alright, so Saturday at the library it is—what time?  

**Speaker B (NS):** How about 1 p.m.? That gives us plenty of time to cover everything without feeling rushed.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Works for me. I’ll bring my notes and we can dive right in.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Awesome. I’ll bring mine, too. I’m actually feeling less stressed about this test already.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Teamwork makes the dream work, as they say.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Couldn’t agree more. Thanks for the pep talk—I’ll see you Saturday!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Good luck with the rest of your week.  

**Speaker B (NS):** You, too. Bye for now!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, bye!
