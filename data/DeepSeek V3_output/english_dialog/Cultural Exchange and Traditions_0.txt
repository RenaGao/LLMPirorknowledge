**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask—what’s your favorite tradition or festival from your culture?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, that’s an easy one! I’d have to say Thanksgiving. There’s just something special about it, you know?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, absolutely! It’s such a heartwarming holiday. What makes it stand out for you?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, it’s all about family and gratitude. It’s the one time of year when everyone comes together, no matter how busy life gets.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so true. And the food—I mean, who can resist a good Thanksgiving feast?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Right? The turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes—it’s like a food coma waiting to happen. But honestly, it’s more about the memories for me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I get that. It’s not just the meal; it’s the whole vibe, the stories, and the laughter around the table.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Exactly! And you know what I love? The tradition of going around and saying what you’re thankful for. It’s such a simple but powerful moment.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s beautiful. It’s a great way to reflect and appreciate what you have. Do you have any other traditions tied to it?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, we always watch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in the morning. It’s kind of cheesy, but it’s become a staple for us.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I love that! It’s those little rituals that make holidays so memorable. Do you ever participate in Black Friday shopping too?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, I used to, but now I’m more about online deals. Fighting crowds isn’t really my thing anymore.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here. I’d rather stay cozy at home with leftovers.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely. Nothing beats a turkey sandwich the next day.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Totally. Hey, this has been such a nice chat about Thanksgiving. I feel like I got to experience it with you a bit.  

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m glad! It’s always fun to share traditions. What about you? Any festivals or traditions you’d recommend?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Maybe we can swap stories about those next time.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Let’s catch up soon!  

**Speaker A (NS):** For sure. Take care, and have a great day!  

**Speaker B (NS):** You too—bye for now!
