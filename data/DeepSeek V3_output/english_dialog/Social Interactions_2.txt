**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sarah! Long time no see. How’ve you been?  
**Speaker B (NS):** Hi, Aunt Linda! I’ve been good, just keeping busy with work and life, you know? How about you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Same here—busy but can’t complain. It’s been ages since we talked! What’s new with you?  
**Speaker B (NS):** Well, actually, I’ve got some exciting news. I’m moving to a new apartment next month!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s fantastic! Congratulations! Where’s the new place?  
**Speaker B (NS):** It’s in the city center, closer to work. It’s a bit pricier, but it’ll save me time commuting.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Time is money, as they say. How’s the packing going?  
**Speaker B (NS):** Ugh, it’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I didn’t realize how much stuff I’ve accumulated over the years.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I hear you. Moving is always a hassle, but it’ll be worth it once you’re settled in. Need any help?  
**Speaker B (NS):** That’s so sweet of you to offer! I think I’ve got it covered, but I’ll let you know if I need a hand.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Please do. You know I’m just a phone call away. So, how’s your mom doing?  
**Speaker B (NS):** She’s great, thanks for asking. She’s been gardening like crazy lately—her yard looks amazing.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. She’s always had such a green thumb. Say hi to her for me, will you?  
**Speaker B (NS):** Of course, I will. She’s always asking about you too.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so nice to hear. We really should plan a family get-together soon.  
**Speaker B (NS):** I’d love that! It’s been way too long since we all caught up.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. I’ll float the idea with everyone and see if we can find a date that works.  
**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Thanks for calling, Aunt Linda. It was so good to hear from you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** It was great catching up with you too, Sarah. Take care with the move, and let me know when you’re all settled in.  
**Speaker B (NS):** Will do. Have a wonderful day, Aunt Linda!   
**Speaker A (NS):** You too, sweetie. Talk soon—bye for now!
