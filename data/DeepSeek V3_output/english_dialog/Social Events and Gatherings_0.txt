**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m Sarah. I don’t think we’ve met before—what’s your name?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey, Sarah! I’m Jake. Nice to meet you. I just moved to the area, so I’m still getting to know people.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, welcome! That’s exciting. What brings you to town?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks! I got a new job in marketing over at the tech company downtown. It’s been a whirlwind so far, but I’m settling in.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a big change! How are you liking it so far?  

**Speaker B (NS):** It’s been pretty good, honestly. The team’s great, and the work is challenging in a good way. Still getting the hang of the commute, though.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I hear you. Traffic here can be a nightmare. Have you found any shortcuts yet?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Not yet, but I’m open to suggestions! I’ve been relying on Google Maps for now.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Fair enough. If you’re ever stuck, I know a couple of back roads that might help.  

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s awesome—I’ll definitely take you up on that. So, do you live around here?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, just a few blocks away. I’ve been here for about five years now. It’s a great neighborhood—lots of friendly people.  

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s good to hear. I’ve been exploring a bit, and it seems like there’s a lot to do. Any recommendations?  

**Speaker A (NS):** For sure! There’s a great little coffee shop on Maple Street, and the park nearby is perfect for a weekend stroll.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds lovely. I’ll have to check those out.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You should! Oh, and if you’re into live music, there’s a cool spot downtown that has bands on Fridays.  

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m all about live music. That’s right up my alley.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Maybe we could check it out together sometime.  

**Speaker B (NS):** I’d really like that. Thanks for being so welcoming—it’s nice to meet someone who knows the ropes.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! It’s great meeting you, Jake. Let’s definitely stay in touch and plan that outing.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely. It was really nice talking to you, Sarah.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here! Enjoy the rest of the party, and I’ll catch you soon.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Will do—thanks again. Take care and goodbye!
