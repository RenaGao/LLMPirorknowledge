**Speaker A (Teacher):** Hi, Sarah. How’s it going? Did you have a question about the homework?  

**Speaker B (Student):** Hey, yeah. I’m a bit confused about the last part of the assignment. Do you mind explaining it again?  

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Of course! Which part are you stuck on?  

**Speaker B (Student):** The section where we’re supposed to analyze the poem’s tone. I’m not entirely sure how to approach it.  

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Got it. So, for tone, think about the emotions or attitudes the poet is conveying. Does the poem feel joyful, sad, sarcastic, or something else?  

**Speaker B (Student):** Hmm, okay. I think it’s kind of bittersweet, but I’m not sure if that’s the right word.  

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Bittersweet is a great start! Why do you think that?  

**Speaker B (Student):** Well, there’s a lot of nostalgia in the poem, but also a sense of loss.  

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Exactly! So, you’d explain how the poet uses specific words or imagery to create that tone. Does that make sense?  

**Speaker B (Student):** Yeah, that helps a lot. I was overcomplicating it, I think.  

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Happens to the best of us! If you’re still unsure, you can always look for examples in the poem where the language or structure reinforces that tone.  

**Speaker B (Student):** Got it. Thanks for breaking it down—it’s a lot clearer now.  

**Speaker A (Teacher):** No problem at all. If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to ask.  

**Speaker B (Student):** Will do. Thanks again, I appreciate it.  

**Speaker A (Teacher):** You’re welcome, Sarah. Good luck with the assignment, and let me know how it goes!  

**Speaker B (Student):** Thanks, I will. Have a great day!  

**Speaker A (Teacher):** You too—goodbye!  

**Speaker B (Student):** Bye!
