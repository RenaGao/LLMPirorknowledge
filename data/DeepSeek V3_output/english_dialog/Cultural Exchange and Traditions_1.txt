**Speaker A:** Hey, Sarah! I’ve been thinking about the cultural differences in dining etiquette. Have you ever had an experience where something caught you off guard?  
**Speaker B:** Oh, for sure! When I was in Japan last year, I learned that slurping noodles is actually a sign of appreciation. Back home, that would’ve been a big no-no!  
**Speaker A:** Right? That’s so interesting. I had a similar moment in France—apparently, keeping your hands on the table during a meal is polite, whereas here, we’re taught to keep them in our laps.  
**Speaker B:** Oh, wow, I didn’t know that about France. It’s funny how these little things can vary so much. What about tipping? That’s another thing that trips people up.  
**Speaker A:** Absolutely! In the U.S., tipping is pretty much expected, but in some countries, like Japan or South Korea, it’s seen as unnecessary or even rude.  
**Speaker B:** Yeah, I always feel a bit awkward when I’m not sure about the tipping culture. Do they think I’m being cheap, or is it just custom?  
**Speaker A:** Exactly! And then there’s the whole utensil thing. I remember being in India and realizing that eating with your hands is completely normal and even preferred in some situations.  
**Speaker B:** Oh, yeah, that’s another good one. It’s kind of liberating once you get used to it, though. I think it makes you more mindful of the food.  
**Speaker A:** Totally. It’s fascinating how these practices reflect deeper cultural values. Like, in some cultures, sharing food from a communal plate is a sign of closeness.  
**Speaker B:** Definitely. It’s all about connection, isn’t it? Even if the practices are different, the intention is often the same—showing hospitality and respect.  
**Speaker A:** That’s such a great way to put it. I think it’s important to approach these differences with curiosity rather than judgment.  
**Speaker B:** Agreed. It’s a learning experience every time. Speaking of which, we should totally swap more stories like this—it’s been so interesting hearing your perspective.  
**Speaker A:** Absolutely! I’d love that. Let’s plan to grab a bite soon and continue this conversation.  
**Speaker B:** Sounds like a plan. Thanks for sharing your insights—it’s been really eye-opening!  
**Speaker A:** Same here, Sarah. Take care, and let’s stay in touch!  
**Speaker B:** Will do! Have a great day! Bye for now!  
**Speaker A:** Bye, take care!  

(The conversation ends within 20 turns with a polite farewell and a summary of the discussion.)
