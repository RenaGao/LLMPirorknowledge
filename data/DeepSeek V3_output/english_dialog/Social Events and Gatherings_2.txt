**Speaker A (NS):** Hey! Great to meet you. I’m Sarah. What’s your name?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Hi Sarah! I’m Jake. Nice to meet you too. How’s your day going so far?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Not bad, thanks! Just wrapped up a meeting, so I’m ready to unwind a bit. How about you?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Same here—been a busy morning, but I’m glad to be chatting now. So, what do you usually do to relax?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I love hiking or just curling up with a good book. You know, something to clear my head. What about you?  

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m into hiking too! There’s nothing like being out in nature, right? I also play guitar to chill out when I’m at home.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome! I’ve always wanted to learn guitar. How long have you been playing?  

**Speaker B (NS):** About five years now. It’s been a fun hobby, though I’m not exactly a pro or anything. Do you play any instruments?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Not really, but I’ve dabbled with the piano. I’m more into listening to music than playing it, honestly.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Nothing wrong with that! What kind of music are you into?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m a big fan of indie folk—artists like Fleet Foxes or Bon Iver. What about you?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, I love that genre too! I also listen to a lot of classic rock—bands like Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great taste! So, we’ve got hiking and music in common. Do you ever combine the two? Like, listen to music while you hike?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Sometimes, though I try to stay present and enjoy the sounds of nature too. But for longer hikes, a playlist definitely helps.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Totally makes sense. By the way, do you have any favorite hiking spots around here?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, there’s this trail about an hour away with an amazing view at the top. It’s a bit of a climb, but worth it. You should check it out sometime.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect! I’m always looking for new places to explore. Maybe we could hike it together sometime?  

**Speaker B (NS):** I’d love that! Let’s plan it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! It’s been great talking to you, Jake. I feel like we’ve got a lot in common.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Same here, Sarah. This was a fun conversation. Let’s definitely stay in touch and make that hike happen soon.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Looking forward to it! Take care, Jake.  

**Speaker B (NS):** You too, Sarah. Have a great day!
