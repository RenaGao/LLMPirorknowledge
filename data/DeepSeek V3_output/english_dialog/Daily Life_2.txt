**Speaker A:** Hey, I was thinking—since we’re roommates now, maybe I could teach you how to make my favorite meal. It’s this super simple pasta dish I absolutely swear by.  

**Speaker B:** Oh, that sounds awesome! I’m always up for learning something new, especially if it’s food-related. What’s the dish called?  

**Speaker A:** It’s just a basic creamy garlic parmesan pasta, but I’ve tweaked it over the years to make it super flavorful. It’s a real crowd-pleaser, if I do say so myself.  

**Speaker B:** Nice! I’m all ears. What do we need to get started?  

**Speaker A:** First, we’ll need some spaghetti, heavy cream, garlic, butter, parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Oh, and fresh parsley if you’ve got it—it really elevates the dish.  

**Speaker B:** Got it. I think I’ve got most of that in the pantry already. What’s the first step?  

**Speaker A:** Start by boiling the pasta—just follow the instructions on the box. While that’s cooking, melt some butter in a pan and sauté the garlic until it’s fragrant.  

**Speaker B:** Okay, so just toast the garlic a bit? Got it. How much garlic are we talking?  

**Speaker A:** I usually go for about three cloves, but you can adjust it depending on how much you love garlic.  

**Speaker B:** Perfect—I’m a garlic fan, so three cloves sound great. What’s next?  

**Speaker A:** Once the garlic’s ready, pour in the heavy cream and let it simmer for a couple of minutes. Then, add the parmesan cheese and stir until it’s all melted and creamy.  

**Speaker B:** That sounds delicious already. Do we add the pasta straight into the sauce?  

**Speaker A:** Yep! Once the pasta’s done, drain it and toss it into the sauce. Mix everything together, and if it’s looking a bit thick, you can add a splash of the pasta water to loosen it up.  

**Speaker B:** That makes sense. And I’m guessing the parsley goes on top for garnish?  

**Speaker A:** Exactly—just sprinkle it on before serving. It adds a nice fresh touch.  

**Speaker B:** This sounds so easy and so good. I can’t wait to try it!  

**Speaker A:** I’m glad you’re excited! It’s seriously a lifesaver on busy nights. Plus, it’s way better than takeout.  

**Speaker B:** For sure. Thanks for walking me through it—I’m definitely going to make this next week.  

**Speaker A:** Anytime! Let me know how it turns out. And hey, if you ever want to swap recipes, I’m all for it.  

**Speaker B:** That sounds like a plan. Thanks again for sharing your favorite meal with me—I’m already looking forward to it.  

**Speaker A:** No problem! Enjoy cooking, and let’s catch up later. See you around!  

**Speaker B:** See you later—have a great day!
