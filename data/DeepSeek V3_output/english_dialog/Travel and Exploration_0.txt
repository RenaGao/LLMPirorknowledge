**Speaker A:** Hey, Sarah! I’m so glad we’re finally getting around to planning this trip. How’s your schedule looking for next month?  

**Speaker B:** Totally free! I’ve been dying to get out of town, so I’m all ears. What’s the vibe you’re thinking for this trip?  

**Speaker A:** I was picturing something chill but fun—maybe a city with great food, some local shops, and a couple of landmarks to check out. Any ideas?  

**Speaker B:** Hmm, what about Nashville? I’ve heard the food scene is amazing, and there’s live music everywhere. Plus, it’s not too far to drive.  

**Speaker A:** Nashville’s a great call! I’ve always wanted to check out the honky-tonks. Do you think the others will be into it?  

**Speaker B:** I think so! Everyone loves good music and BBQ. I’ll float it by them and see what they say. How long are we thinking—a weekend?  

**Speaker A:** Yeah, a long weekend would be perfect. Maybe Friday to Monday? That way we don’t feel too rushed.  

**Speaker B:** Sounds good to me. Let’s aim for the second weekend of next month. Do you want to handle the accommodations, or should I?  

**Speaker A:** I can take care of it. I’ll look for an Airbnb or a hotel in the downtown area so we’re close to everything.  

**Speaker B:** Perfect. I’ll start researching some must-see spots and restaurants. I’ll make a shared list so we can all add ideas.  

**Speaker A:** That’s a great idea. Oh, and we should probably figure out transportation. Are we driving or flying?  

**Speaker B:** Driving would be cheaper, and it’s only about a six-hour trip. We could split the cost of gas and take turns behind the wheel.  

**Speaker A:** Works for me. I’ll check with the group to make sure everyone’s okay with that. What’s your budget looking like?  

**Speaker B:** I’m thinking around $300–$400 for the whole trip. That should cover food, activities, and my share of the lodging.  

**Speaker A:** Same here. I’ll let everyone know so we’re all on the same page. Anything else we need to nail down now?  

**Speaker B:** Not off the top of my head. Let’s touch base again once we’ve heard back from the group and have more details.  

**Speaker A:** Sounds good. I’m already excited—this is going to be such a fun getaway.  

**Speaker B:** Me too! I’ll text everyone tonight and get the ball rolling. Thanks for taking the lead on this, by the way.  

**Speaker A:** Happy to! Let’s chat soon. Have a great day, Sarah!  

**Speaker B:** You too—talk to you later!  

**Speaker A:** Bye for now! Let’s make this trip unforgettable.  

**Speaker B:** Absolutely—catch you later!
