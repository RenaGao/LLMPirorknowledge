**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m interested in this vase. How much are you asking for it?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, great choice! That one’s $45. It’s handmade, so it’s really unique.  

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s beautiful, but that’s a bit steep for me. Could you do $30?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Hmm, $30 is pretty low. I could go down to $40, but that’s my best offer.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I get that it’s handmade, but $40 still feels a little high. How about we meet in the middle—$35?  

**Speaker B (NS):** You drive a hard bargain! Tell you what, I’ll do $35 if you buy something else small with it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fair. I’ve been eyeing that little candle holder. How much is that?  

**Speaker B (NS):** That one’s $10, but I’ll throw it in for $5 if you take the vase.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Deal! So, $40 for the vase and the candle holder?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Exactly. You’re getting a steal, honestly.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll take them both.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Great choice! Let me wrap them up for you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you so much. I’m really happy with these.  

**Speaker B (NS):** My pleasure! Enjoy them, and thanks for shopping with me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks again. Have a great day!  

**Speaker B (NS):** You too—take care and come back anytime!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Will do. Goodbye!  

**Speaker B (NS):** Goodbye and happy decorating!
