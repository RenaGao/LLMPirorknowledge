**Speaker A:** Hey, thanks for calling me back. I’ve been having this issue with my internet service, and I’m at my wit’s end.  
**Speaker B:** No problem at all! I get how frustrating that can be. What’s been going on?  
**Speaker A:** Well, my connection keeps dropping randomly, and it’s driving me up the wall. I’ve rebooted the router a bunch of times, but no luck.  
**Speaker B:** Ugh, that sounds like a nightmare. Have you checked if it’s a problem on their end? Sometimes it’s not you, it’s them, you know?  
**Speaker A:** Yeah, I checked their service status page, and it says everything’s fine. But I’m not buying it.  
**Speaker B:** Hmm, okay. Maybe it’s worth giving their customer service a call. I know it’s a hassle, but sometimes you’ve gotta go straight to the source.  
**Speaker A:** True. I was dreading that because, honestly, their hold times are ridiculous. But I guess I don’t have much of a choice.  
**Speaker B:** Totally get that. If it helps, I’ve found calling early in the morning or late at night can sometimes cut down on the wait. You might catch them when it’s less busy.  
**Speaker A:** That’s a good tip. I’ll give it a shot tomorrow morning. Thanks for that!  
**Speaker B:** No worries. Also, if they try to fob you off with the usual “turn it off and on again” spiel, don’t let them. Be firm and ask for a technician if it’s not resolved.  
**Speaker A:** Yeah, I’ll make sure to stand my ground. I hate feeling brushed off.  
**Speaker B:** Exactly. You’re the customer—you deserve better. Let me know how it goes, alright?  
**Speaker A:** Will do. I really appreciate your advice. It’s nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of.  
**Speaker B:** Anytime! That’s what friends are for. Fingers crossed they sort it out quickly for you.  
**Speaker A:** Thanks, I’ll keep you posted. Talk soon!  
**Speaker B:** Sounds good. Take care and good luck sorting it out!  
**Speaker A:** You, too. Bye for now!  
**Speaker B:** Bye!
