**Speaker A:** Hey, I’m glad we could hop on this call to plan Jake’s surprise party. Let’s brainstorm some ideas—what do you think?

**Speaker B:** Totally! I’ve been thinking about this for a while. How about we throw it at his favorite park? He loves being outdoors, and it’s a great spot.

**Speaker A:** That’s a solid idea. I was also thinking about having it at his place—that way, we can decorate more easily and keep it low-key. But the park could be fun too. What do you think?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, I see your point. His place would definitely be easier to manage, and we could surprise him when he gets home. Plus, we wouldn’t have to worry about the weather. Let’s go with that.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. Now, what about the theme? Should we keep it casual or go all out?

**Speaker B:** I think casual works best for Jake. He’s not big on flashy stuff. Maybe we could do a “favorite memories” theme where everyone brings a small photo or story to share about him.

**Speaker A:** That’s such a thoughtful idea! He’d love that. And it wouldn’t cost much either. What about food? Should we cater or just ask everyone to bring something?

**Speaker B:** Let’s keep it potluck-style. It’s easier, and Jake always says he loves homemade food. We can assign dishes to people so we don’t end up with ten salads.

**Speaker A:** Good call. And drinks—should we go for a mix of alcoholic and non-alcoholic options? I know Jake likes craft beer, but not everyone drinks.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let’s cover all bases. We can grab some craft beers for Jake and have soda, water, and maybe a signature mocktail for everyone else.

**Speaker A:** Sounds like we’ve got the basics covered. What about decorations? We don’t want to overdo it, but a little something would be nice.

**Speaker B:** How about balloons, streamers, and a big banner that says, “Surprise, Jake!”? Simple but festive. I can take care of that if you want.

**Speaker A:** That’d be great. I’ll handle the invites and make sure everyone knows the plan. Oh, and we’ll need to time it perfectly—when’s the best time to surprise him?

**Speaker B:** Let’s aim for around 6 p.m. on Saturday. That gives us time to set up after he leaves for his afternoon jog. We can have someone keep him out of the house until we’re ready.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. I’ll ask Sarah to distract him—she’s great at keeping him busy without raising suspicion. Anything else we’re missing?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, not that I can think of. Oh, maybe a playlist? Jake loves 90s rock. We could throw together a Spotify playlist for the party.

**Speaker A:** Love that idea. I’ll take care of it. So, to summarize: his place, casual theme, potluck food, drinks, simple decorations, and a 90s rock playlist. Did I miss anything?

**Speaker B:** Nope, you nailed it. I think we’re all set. Excited to see his reaction—he’s going to be so surprised!

**Speaker A:** Me too. Thanks for jumping in on this—it’s going to be great. Let’s touch base later this week to finalize the details.

**Speaker B:** Sounds like a plan. Talk soon, and let’s make this the best surprise party ever. Bye for now!

**Speaker A:** Agreed! Bye, and let’s rock this.
