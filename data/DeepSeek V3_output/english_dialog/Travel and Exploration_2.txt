**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m a bit lost—could you help me find my way to the town square?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely, no problem! You’re actually pretty close. Just head straight down this street for about two blocks.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Straight down this street—any landmarks I should look out for?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, you’ll pass a big red clock tower on your left. You can’t miss it. After that, take a right at the intersection.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, red clock tower, then a right. Sounds straightforward. Is the square easy to spot once I’m there?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely. It’s a huge open space with a fountain in the middle. There’s usually a lot of people hanging around, so it’s hard to miss.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’m glad it’s not too complicated. By the way, is there parking nearby in case I need it?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh sure, there’s a parking garage just behind the square. It’s a bit tucked away, but there are signs pointing you to it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s super helpful. I’ll keep an eye out for those signs. Thanks so much—you’ve saved me a lot of time.  

**Speaker B (NS):** No worries at all! Happy to help. Are you visiting the square for something special?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Actually, I’m meeting a friend for lunch at one of the cafes there. I’ve heard the food is great.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, you’re in for a treat! The café by the fountain has the best pastries in town.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s exactly where we’re meeting! I’ll have to try one.  

**Speaker B (NS):** You won’t regret it. Enjoy your lunch and your time in town!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks again for the directions—you’ve been a lifesaver. Have a great day!  

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! Take care and enjoy the square. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
