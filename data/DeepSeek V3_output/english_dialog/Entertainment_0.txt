**Speaker A:** Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? I feel like I owe you an apology.  

**Speaker B:** Sure, what’s up? Everything okay?  

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it’s just... I realized I dropped the ball on that project deadline last week. I know it put you in a tough spot, and I’m really sorry about that.  

**Speaker B:** Oh, right. Yeah, it was a bit stressful trying to catch up, but I appreciate you acknowledging it.  

**Speaker A:** I feel terrible about it. I should’ve communicated better and stayed on top of things. It was totally on me.  

**Speaker B:** Thanks for saying that. I get it—things happen. But, you know, it’s all about how we handle it moving forward.  

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. I’ve already started reorganizing my workflow to make sure it doesn’t happen again. I’ll set reminders and keep you in the loop every step of the way.  

**Speaker B:** That sounds like a solid plan. I think that’ll help both of us stay aligned.  

**Speaker A:** For sure. And if there’s anything else I can do to make it right, just let me know. I’m happy to take on extra tasks or help out however I can.  

**Speaker B:** That means a lot. Honestly, just knowing you’re taking responsibility and being proactive is a big help.  

**Speaker A:** I’m glad to hear that. I really value our working relationship, and I don’t want to let something like this get in the way.  

**Speaker B:** Same here. I think we’re good—no hard feelings. Let’s just move forward and keep crushing it.  

**Speaker A:** Agreed. Thanks for being so understanding. I’ll make sure this doesn’t happen again.  

**Speaker B:** No problem at all. We’re a team, right? We’ve got each other’s backs.  

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. Thanks for the chat—I feel a lot better about this now.  

**Speaker B:** Me too. Let’s touch base later this week to make sure everything’s on track.  

**Speaker A:** Sounds like a plan. Talk to you then—have a great day!  

**Speaker B:** You too. Take care!  

**Speaker A:** See you later!  

**Speaker B:** Bye!
