**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sarah! How’s it going? Are you ready for the exam next week?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Hi! Honestly, I’m a bit nervous. I’ve been studying, but there’s just so much material to cover. How about you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I know what you mean. It’s like drinking from a firehose, isn’t it? I’ve been trying to focus on the key concepts, but I still feel like I’m missing something.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Totally. I’ve been using flashcards for the definitions, but some of the theories are really throwing me for a loop. Do you have any tips for that?  

**Speaker A (NS):** For sure! I’ve been explaining the theories out loud to myself—it sounds silly, but it helps me understand them better. Maybe we could go over them together sometime?  

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s a great idea! I think studying with someone else would be a huge help. How about we meet tomorrow after class?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let’s meet at the library around 3 PM. I’ll bring my notes, and we can go through the tricky parts together.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. I’ll bring my laptop too, in case we need to look anything up.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Good thinking. Oh, by the way, have you checked out the study guide the professor posted? It’s been a lifesaver for me.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, I’ve been using it, but some of the examples are still confusing. Maybe we can tackle those tomorrow too.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. We’ll figure it out together. It’s always easier when you’re not flying solo.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Agreed. Thanks for suggesting this—I already feel less stressed about it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! We’ve got this. Just remember to take breaks too. Burning yourself out won’t help.  

**Speaker B (NS):** True. I’ll try to balance it better. I’ve been staying up way too late cramming, and it’s not doing me any favors.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here. Let’s aim to wrap up by 8 PM tomorrow so we can get some rest.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Deal. I’m looking forward to it. Thanks again for organizing this.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! We’ll knock this exam out of the park. See you tomorrow at 3!  

**Speaker B (NS):** See you then. Good luck with the rest of your studying today!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You too—take care and goodbye!
