**Speaker A (NS):** Hey there! Excuse me, do you mind helping me out? I’m a bit lost and trying to find a nearby hotel.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, sure thing! No problem at all. Do you know the name of the hotel you’re looking for?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, it’s called The Riverside Inn. I think it’s supposed to be somewhere around here.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, right! The Riverside Inn. It’s actually not too far from here. You’re in luck—you’re pretty close.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a relief! Could you point me in the right direction?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Of course. So, you’ll want to head straight down this street for about three blocks. You’ll pass a big red brick building on your left—it’s hard to miss.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it—red brick building, three blocks.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Exactly. After that, turn right onto Maple Avenue. The hotel’s just a short walk down that road on your right.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Maple Avenue, turn right, and it’s on the right. Sounds straightforward.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Yep, you’ve got it! Oh, and there’s a little café next to the hotel if you’re looking for a quick bite.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Thanks so much for the tip—and for the directions. You’ve been a huge help.  

**Speaker B (NS):** No worries at all! Happy to help. Let me know if you need anything else while you’re in town.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Will do. Thanks again—and enjoy the rest of your day!  

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! Safe travels and enjoy your stay at The Riverside Inn.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, I will. Take care and goodbye!  

**Speaker B (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great one!
