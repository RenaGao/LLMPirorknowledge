**Speaker A:** Hey, thanks for jumping on this call. We really need to nail down the plans for Sam’s birthday surprise. You know how much it means to them.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, I’m all in! Sam’s been such a great friend, so we’ve got to make this special. What’s the game plan so far?

**Speaker A:** Well, I was thinking we could throw a surprise party at their place. We’d decorate while they’re out and have everyone hide. What do you think?

**Speaker B:** That sounds awesome! And Sam’s got that big living room, so it’s perfect for a crowd. We could theme it—maybe something nostalgic, like their favorite childhood cartoons?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I love that idea! Sam’s always talking about how much they loved *The Powerpuff Girls*. We could go all out with the decor and even some themed snacks.

**Speaker B:** Yes! And we could ask everyone to dress up as their favorite cartoon character. That would be a riot. Do you think we could pull that off in time?

**Speaker A:** I think so. The party’s two weeks away, so if we delegate tasks, it’s totally doable. I’ll handle the decorations if you can take care of the food. Sound good?

**Speaker B:** You’re on! I’ll whip up some snacks—maybe even a *Powerpuff Girls* cake. Should we loop in Jess and Chris to help with the invites and music?

**Speaker A:** Perfect. Jess is great with invites, and Chris always has killer playlists. I’ll shoot them a message tonight to get them on board.

**Speaker B:** Cool. Oh, and we’ll need to figure out a way to get Sam out of the house for a few hours. Any ideas?

**Speaker A:** I was thinking we could tell Sam we’re going out for lunch, but then “suddenly” remember we left something at their place. That’ll give us time to set up.

**Speaker B:** Genius! They’ll never see it coming. I’ll make sure to keep them distracted while we’re out.

**Speaker A:** Alright, so we’ve got the location, theme, food, and a way to get Sam out of the house. Anything else we’re missing?

**Speaker B:** Hmm... maybe a little something extra, like a photo album or video montage of all our memories with Sam? They’d love that.

**Speaker A:** That’s such a sweet idea. I’ll start collecting photos and put it together. You think we’re all set, then?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think we’ve got it covered. This is going to be amazing—Sam’s going to be over the moon!

**Speaker A:** I’m so excited! Thanks for all your input. Let’s touch base later this week to make sure we’re on track.

**Speaker B:** Sounds good. Catch you later, and let’s make this the best birthday ever for Sam!

**Speaker A:** Agreed. Talk soon—take care and goodbye!

**Speaker B:** Bye! Can’t wait to see how it all turns out.
