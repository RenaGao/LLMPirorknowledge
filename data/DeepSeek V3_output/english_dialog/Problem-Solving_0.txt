**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for meeting up. I felt like we needed to clear the air about what happened last week.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, absolutely. I’ve been thinking about it too, and I didn’t want things to get awkward between us.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here. I think there was just a misunderstanding, and I hate leaving things unresolved.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Totally. I think I overreacted a bit, and I’m sorry if I came off as harsh. That wasn’t my intention.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I appreciate that. I think I could’ve been clearer about what I meant. Sometimes I forget not everyone’s on the same page as me.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, I get that. I think I took it the wrong way because I was already stressed about other things. It’s not an excuse, but just context.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. I’ve been there—when you’re stressed, everything feels bigger than it is. I should’ve been more considerate.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Honestly, it’s on both of us. I could’ve taken a step back instead of jumping to conclusions.  

**Speaker A (NS):** True. But I’m really glad we’re talking it out. It’s not worth losing a good friendship over something small.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Exactly. I value our friendship too, and I’d hate for something like this to come between us.  

**Speaker A (NS):** For sure. I think we’ve both learned something from this, right?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely. Next time, I’ll try to communicate better instead of letting things simmer.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here. And I’ll make sure to think about how my words might come across.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. I’m really glad we sorted this out—it’s a weight off my shoulders.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Mine too. Let’s not let things fester next time, okay?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely not. Communication is key, as they say.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. Thanks for being so open about this. I really appreciate it.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Of course. Thanks for understanding and taking the time to talk it through.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I’ll let you get going. Let’s catch up again soon—this time without any drama!  

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good. Take care, and I’ll see you soon!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You too—bye for now!  

**Speaker B (NS):** Bye! Have a great day!
