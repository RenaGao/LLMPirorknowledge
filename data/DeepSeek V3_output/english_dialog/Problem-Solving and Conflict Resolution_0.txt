**Speaker A:** Hey, I just wanted to check in with you about what happened the other day. I feel like there might have been a misunderstanding between us.  

**Speaker B:** Oh, yeah? I was wondering if something was off. What’s on your mind?  

**Speaker A:** Well, I know we were talking about the project deadline, and I got the impression you were upset with me for bringing it up. Was I reading that wrong?  

**Speaker B:** Oh, no, I wasn’t upset with you at all! I think I was just stressed about it myself. I might’ve come across a bit snappy—totally my bad.  

**Speaker A:** Okay, that makes sense. I was worried I overstepped or something.  

**Speaker B:** Not at all! Honestly, I appreciate you bringing it up. I think I just needed to vent a little, and it wasn’t about you.  

**Speaker A:** Got it. I’m glad we’re on the same page. I just wanted to clear the air because I value our friendship and didn’t want anything hanging over us.  

**Speaker B:** Same here. Thanks for being upfront about it—it means a lot. You’re a good friend.  

**Speaker A:** You are too. I’m glad we could talk this out. It’s always better to hash things out instead of letting them fester, you know?  

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. Communication is key, and I’m glad we’re both on board with that.  

**Speaker A:** Me too. So, we’re good?  

**Speaker B:** Totally good. No hard feelings at all.  

**Speaker A:** Perfect. Let’s grab coffee soon and catch up properly.  

**Speaker B:** Sounds great. I’ll text you to figure out a day.  

**Speaker A:** Awesome. Thanks for hearing me out, and I’m glad we’re sorted.  

**Speaker B:** Same here. Have a great day, and I’ll talk to you soon!  

**Speaker A:** You too—take care!  

**Speaker B:** Bye!
