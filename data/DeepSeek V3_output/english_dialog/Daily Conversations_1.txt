**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sarah! What are you up to this weekend?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, not much planned yet. I’m thinking of taking it easy—maybe catch up on some reading. How about you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds relaxing! I’m actually heading to the farmers’ market on Saturday morning. I heard they’ve got some amazing fresh produce this time of year.  

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds fun! I’ve been meaning to check that out. What else is on your agenda?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, after the market, I might hit the gym. It’s been a while, and I need to get back into the swing of things.  

**Speaker B (NS):** I hear you. I’ve been slacking on that front too. Maybe I’ll join you sometime next week?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Totally! We could make it a thing—working out together keeps you motivated, you know?  

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely. Plus, it’s way more fun when you’ve got someone to chat with. So, any other plans?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, Sunday is wide open. I might just binge-watch that new show everyone’s been talking about.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, which one? Is it the crime drama?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, that’s the one! I’ve heard it’s a real nail-biter.  

**Speaker B (NS):** I’ve been meaning to check that out too. Maybe I’ll start it this weekend and we can compare notes.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Let me know what you think.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Will do! Oh, and if you’re up for it, we could grab coffee on Sunday afternoon.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’d be great! I’m always down for a good cup of coffee and some chit-chat.  

**Speaker B (NS):** Perfect. Let’s say 2 PM at our usual spot?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Works for me. I’ll see you then!  

**Speaker B (NS):** Looking forward to it. Have a fantastic weekend, and don’t forget to enjoy that farmers’ market haul!  

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Sarah! Take care and see you Sunday!  

**Speaker B (NS):** See you Sunday—bye for now!
