**Speaker A (Store Employee):** Hi there! How can I assist you today?  

**Speaker B (Customer):** Hi! I’ve got a bit of an issue. I bought this blender last week, but it’s not working properly. I was wondering about your return policy.  

**Speaker A:** Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. Let me walk you through our policy. Do you have your receipt with you?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I do. Here it is.  

**Speaker A:** Great! So, for faulty products, we offer a full refund or exchange within 30 days of purchase. You’re well within that window, so we can definitely help you out.  

**Speaker B:** That’s a relief! I’d actually like to exchange it for a different model if that’s okay.  

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. Do you have a specific one in mind?  

**Speaker B:** Yes, I was looking at the one with the stainless steel base. It seems more durable.  

**Speaker A:** Good choice—that’s a popular model. Let me grab it for you. *[Pauses briefly.]* Here it is. Would you like to test it before we finalize the exchange?  

**Speaker B:** That’s thoughtful, but I trust it’ll work fine. I’ll take it!  

**Speaker A:** Perfect. I’ll just need to process the exchange at the counter. *[Processes the transaction.]* All set! Here’s your new blender and an updated receipt.  

**Speaker B:** Thanks so much! You’ve been really helpful.  

**Speaker A:** No problem at all. I’m glad we could sort it out quickly. If you have any issues with this one, don’t hesitate to come back.  

**Speaker B:** Will do. Thanks again!  

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome. Have a great day, and enjoy your new blender!  

**Speaker B:** You too—goodbye!  

**Speaker A:** Goodbye!
