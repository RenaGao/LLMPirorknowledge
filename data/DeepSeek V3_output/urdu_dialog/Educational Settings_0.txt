**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ahmed! Do you have a minute to talk about the assignment?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes. I have confusion about the... um, task.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, what part is unclear to you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** The part where we need to... um, write about the theme of story. I don’t understand what is "theme" exactly.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. The theme is the main idea or message of the story. For example, if a story is about friendship, the theme could be "the importance of trust."  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, okay. So, I need to find main idea? Not the... um, summary?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Focus on the deeper meaning, not just what happens in the story.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, teacher. This makes more sense now. But also, how many pages we need to write?  
**Speaker A (NS):** It should be around two pages. Does that sound manageable?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, two pages is okay. But I worry about grammar. I don’t want to make many mistake.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry too much. Focus on expressing your ideas clearly. I’ll help you with grammar when I review it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, teacher. You are very kind.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Is there anything else you need help with?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think it’s enough. I will start to write now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let me know if you have more questions. Good luck with the assignment!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, teacher. I will try my best. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Ahmed! Have a great day.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You also have a good day, teacher. I will work on assignment now.
