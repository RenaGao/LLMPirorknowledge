**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Ali! How has your year been so far?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, hello! It is... um, good, but also busy. I have many thing to do.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Do you have any goals for the next year?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes. I want to improve my English. It is important for my job. And also, I want to... um, how to say... learn new skill?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Learning new skills is a great goal! What kind of skills are you thinking about?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe... programming? I hear it is useful. But I not know where to start.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. There are many online courses you could try. Do you have a specific plan?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I think... I will find course on internet. Maybe spend one hour every day? But sometimes I feel... how to say... lazy?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That happens to everyone! Setting small goals can help. Like starting with 15 minutes a day and increasing it slowly.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! This is good advice. I will try it. And for English, I think... um, I will read more books.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Reading is a great way to improve. Do you have any favorite genres?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like storybooks. And sometimes... um, articles about technology.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect! It will help with both English and your programming goal.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think so. But I worry... will I have time for all this?  

**Speaker A (NS):** You don’t have to do everything at once. Focus on one thing at a time.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, you are right. One thing at a time. This is... um, better plan.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! I’m sure you’ll do great. Is there anything else you’d like to achieve next year?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe... um, travel? I want to visit new place, but I not decide yet.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Traveling is always exciting. Where would you like to go?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe UK? I hear it is very beautiful. And I can practice English there.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! It’s a wonderful place to visit and improve your language skills.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, but first I need to save money.  

**Speaker A (NS):** True, traveling can be expensive. But planning ahead can help.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you for your advice. It is very helpful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I’m sure you’ll achieve all your goals if you stay focused.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I hope so. Thank you for talking with me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Ali! Good luck with everything, and let me know how it goes.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, and take care!
