**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Zara! Do you have any plans for the weekend?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! I think I will go to... um, how to say... the place where many books are?  

**Speaker A (NS):** The library?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, library! I need to take some books for my study.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good. Which books are you planning to read?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I want to read about history... and also maybe one storybook. I like stories very much.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice. Do you have a favorite author?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I don’t know English authors very well, but in Urdu, I like Allama Iqbal. He writes... how to say... poems?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, poetry! That’s wonderful. Do you write poetry too?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sometimes I try, but my English is not so good for poems.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry, practice makes perfect. What else are you planning to do this weekend?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe I will cook some food. I want to make biryani. It is very famous dish in Pakistan.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! I’ve heard biryani is really flavorful.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it has many spices. You should come and try it one day!  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to! Do you need any help with anything this weekend?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think I can manage. But maybe I will borrow your... um, thing for fixing paper?  

**Speaker A (NS):** A stapler? Sure, you can borrow it anytime.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! You are very helpful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Let me know if you need anything else. Have a great weekend, Zara!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! You too. We will talk later, okay?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Take care!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, take care. Bye-bye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
