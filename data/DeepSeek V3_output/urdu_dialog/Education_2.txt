**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ali! How’s it going? Do you have a moment?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, hello. I am good, thank you. How are you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I wanted to check—did you understand the homework assignment?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I think yes, but... how to say... I have some problem with the last question.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, sure, which part is confusing?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** The one about... um... the thing with numbers and graphs.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Are you talking about question 3, the one with the bar chart?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! Bar chart. I not understand what to write.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. You need to compare the data in the chart and explain the differences between the two years.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, ok. I see. But can you say again, what is... compare?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure. It means to look at the two years and write how they are different, like which year has more or less.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes, now I understand. Thank you, teacher.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Do you need help with anything else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, no, I think that is all. You explain very good. Thank you again.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Glad I could help. If you have more questions, just let me know.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will. Thank you, teacher. Have a good day!  
**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Ali. See you in class tomorrow!
