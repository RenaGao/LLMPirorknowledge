**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Welcome to the team. I wanted to go over the task for today.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, thank you. Yes, I am ready to learn. What is the... um, work for today?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! We need to organize the customer feedback forms. Can you help with that?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, feedback forms. Yes, but I don’t know... how to say... steps for doing?  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. First, you’ll sort the forms into categories—positive, negative, and neutral. Does that make sense?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, positive, negative, neutral. I understand. Then?  
**Speaker A (NS):** After that, you’ll count how many forms are in each category and write the numbers on this sheet.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, counting. Yes, I can do. But if I don’t understand some words, what I do?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay. Just ask me, or you can skip that form and move to the next one.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, thank you. I will try my best.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let me know if you have any questions. You can start now.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** One more thing. After counting, where I put the forms?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, right. You’ll put them in these folders—green for positive, red for negative, and blue for neutral.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, colors make easy. I will do carefully.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll check on you in a bit. Good luck!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I will start now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let me know if you need anything.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sure. I will.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I’ll leave you to it. Good luck, and welcome again!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you so much! I will do my best.
