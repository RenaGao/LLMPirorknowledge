**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for chatting with me today. I thought we could talk about dining customs in different cultures. What’s dining etiquette like in your culture?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. In my culture, Pakistan, we use hands for eating many food. Like roti or rice. But it is... um, important to use only right hand. Left hand is, uh, not polite.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Using only the right hand is considered polite. That’s interesting! Do you eat together as a family?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, family eat together. We sit on floor, and food is in one big plate. All people share food from same plate. It is... um, how to say... sign of closeness.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds very communal and welcoming. Here, we often use separate plates and utensils. Do you have any special gestures or words before eating?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we say “Bismillah”—means “In the name of God.” Before eating, it is respectful to say this. Also, we try to finish all food. Not waste is good.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a wonderful practice. It’s great to show gratitude and avoid waste. Here, some people say “Bon appétit” or just start eating. Do you drink tea after meals?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, chai is very important! After meal, we drink chai with family. Sometimes with cardamom or sugar. It is... um, how to say... relaxing time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. Here, coffee is more common, but tea is becoming popular too. Do you have any dining customs that might surprise someone from the U.S.?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, maybe... in my culture, it is polite to offer food again and again. Like, “Take more, take more!” Even if you say no, we insist. It is... how to say... showing care.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so kind! Here, we usually ask once, but insisting might feel too pushy. It’s good to know these differences.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is important to understand culture, I think. Also, in my home, elder people eat first. Younger must wait. It is... um, sign of respect.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a beautiful way to show respect for elders. Here, everyone usually starts together. Thank you for sharing—this has been fascinating!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You’re welcome! I also learn a lot. Maybe one day, I visit your country and try your food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great! Let’s wrap up here, but it was really nice talking to you. Take care!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, thank you! Goodbye and take care too. We will meet again, insha’Allah.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. See you next time!  

(The conversation ends with both speakers expressing farewell and a hopeful tone for future interaction.)
