**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ali! I noticed there’s been some confusion about the project deadlines. Can we talk about how to fix this?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes, I also think this problem. It is making... um, how to say... trouble for team.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Let’s figure out a plan. First, do you think we need to set clearer deadlines?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, clear deadline is important. But sometimes, team member not understand deadline. Maybe we can... um, tell them personally?  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. We could assign one person to remind everyone. Who do you think should do that?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Perhaps, I can do this. I can, um... send message to all team members.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And should we also have a weekly check-in meeting?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Weekly meeting? Yes, it is good idea. But not too long, because... um, people get busy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. We’ll keep it short—maybe 15 minutes. Just to update everyone on progress.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, this is better. And also, I think we need to, um... prioritize tasks. Some work is more important, right?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Let’s make a priority list and share it with the team. Do you want to help me create it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sure, I can help. We can, um... make list in Excel or Google Sheet?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Either works! Let’s start with Google Sheets so everyone can see it. When can we work on this?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Tomorrow morning is good for me. After, um... 10 AM?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll send you a calendar invite. Anything else we should add to our plan?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think this is enough for now. If more problem come, we can solve later.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Thanks for your help, Ali! I’m sure this will make things smoother.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You’re welcome. And thank you also for your guidance. We will fix this problem soon.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. Let’s touch base tomorrow morning then. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too! Goodbye for now.  

*The conversation ends with both speakers agreeing to work on the plan the next morning.*
