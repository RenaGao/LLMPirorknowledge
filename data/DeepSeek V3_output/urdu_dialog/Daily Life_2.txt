**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I’m so excited to have you as my new roommate. Can you tell me about your favorite meal and how you prepare it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, thank you! My favorite meal is biryani. It is very famous in Pakistan.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of biryani! It’s a rice dish, right?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is rice with... um, meat? Usually chicken. And many... how to say... masalas?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Spices?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, spices! Like turmeric, cumin, and garam masala. It is very tasty.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious. How do you start making it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** First, I... uh, take rice and boil it. Then I cook chicken with onion, garlic, and tomato. After that, I mix all the spices and... um, layer them.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You layer the rice and the chicken?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, layer rice, then chicken, then rice again. Last, I put some... uh, thing for color... uh, yellow.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Saffron?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, saffron! And then I cook it on low heat for... maybe twenty minutes.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that sounds like a lot of work, but it must be worth it!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is! And we eat it with... um, yogurt and salad.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing. Maybe you can teach me how to make it sometime?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Of course! I will teach you. It is very easy if you know the steps.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that. Thanks for sharing!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome. I think... um, we will enjoy cooking together.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Me too. And I think our food problem is solved now!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, definitely. Thanks again, and welcome to our home!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I am very happy to be here.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s catch up more later.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, later. Bye!
