**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Let’s plan for Friday evening. Do you have any ideas for where we could go?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! I think we can go to... um, restaurant. Or maybe some activity. What you prefer?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Both sound good! What kind of restaurant do you like?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like Indian food, but also... um, how to say... place with many foods?  
**Speaker A (NS):** A buffet, maybe?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, buffet! I like buffet because I can try many things.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great option. Do you know any good buffet places nearby?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, there is one called... um, “Spice & Taste.” It is near market. I go there one time, food is... how to say... very tasty.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect! What about after dinner? Would you like to do something fun?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, maybe we can go to... um, place where we watch movie?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The cinema?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, cinema! Or... um, another idea is bowling. I never try it, but it seems fun.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bowling is a lot of fun! We could do that if you’re interested.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I would like to try. So, first we eat at buffet, then go for bowling. Good plan?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect! What time should we meet?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe 6:30 at restaurant? Then we have enough time for bowling.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That works for me. Should I book a table at “Spice & Taste”?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, booking is good idea. Sometimes it is full, especially Friday.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I’ll take care of that. Looking forward to Friday!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Me too! Thank you for planning. I think it will be... um, very enjoyable evening.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed! I’ll text you the details once I book the table.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will wait for message. See you on Friday!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a great day.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, you also. Bye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
