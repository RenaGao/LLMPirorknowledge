**Speaker A (Native Speaker, Customer Service):**  
Hello, thank you for calling customer service. How can I help you today?  

**Speaker B (Second-Language Learner, Customer):**  
Hello, um... I have problem with my... purchase.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
I see. Could you tell me what the issue is?  

**Speaker B (L2):**  
Yes, I buy phone online, but it is not working properly.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
I’m sorry to hear that. Can you explain what’s wrong with the phone?  

**Speaker B (L2):**  
The screen is... um, not turning on. I try to charge, but nothing happen.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
That sounds frustrating. Did you check the charger or the cable to make sure they’re working?  

**Speaker B (L2):**  
Yes, I try other charger also, but still problem is same.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
Got it. Can you provide me with your order number so I can look into this?  

**Speaker B (L2):**  
Ah, yes. Order number is... um, 123456.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
Thank you. Let me check... Ah, I see your order here. Since the phone isn’t working, we can either replace it or process a refund. Which would you prefer?  

**Speaker B (L2):**  
I think... replacement is better.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
Alright. I’ll set up a replacement for you. You’ll receive an email with all the details. Do you have any questions?  

**Speaker B (L2):**  
How long it will take?  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
It usually takes about 3 to 5 business days.  

**Speaker B (L2):**  
Okay, that is fine. Thank you for help.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
You’re welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  

**Speaker B (L2):**  
No, that’s all. Thank you again.  

**Speaker A (NS):**  
Thank you for calling. Have a great day!  

**Speaker B (L2):**  
You also have a nice day. Goodbye!

Goodbye!
