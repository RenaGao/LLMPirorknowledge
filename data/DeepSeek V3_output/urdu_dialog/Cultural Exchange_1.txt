**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sara! How’s it going? I heard you moved here recently. How are you finding the food culture?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, thank you! It is... um, very different from my country. In Pakistan, we eat with hands mostly. Here, I see people use fork and knife always. It is... how to say... new for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Eating with hands is actually common in many cultures. Do you feel comfortable using cutlery now?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I am trying. But sometimes, I feel... um, not natural. Also, in my home, we share food from one plate. Here, everyone has own plate. It is different but okay.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting! Sharing food sounds lovely. What about mealtimes? Are they the same as back home?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, no. In Pakistan, we eat dinner late. Sometimes 9 or 10 pm. Here, people eat early, like 6 or 7. I feel hungry again before sleep!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I get that. Did you know in some cultures, lunch is the biggest meal? In others, it’s dinner.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! In Pakistan, lunch is heavy meal. Dinner is light. Here, dinner is big. It is... um... opposite.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fascinating! Have you tried any local dishes yet?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I try pizza and pasta. It is good, but... I miss my biryani and kebabs. Maybe one day I cook for you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Biryani sounds amazing. Let’s plan a dinner soon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, yes! I will cook and show you... um... how we eat in Pakistan. You will like it, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure I will! Thanks for sharing all this. It’s great to learn about different dining cultures.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you also. It is nice to talk about my culture. I feel... more comfortable now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful! Let’s catch up again soon. Take care, Sara!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, take care! See you next time. Goodbye!
