**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ali! I’m glad we’re planning this surprise party for Sara. Do you have any ideas for it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! I think we... um, we should make it in her flat. Her flat is big and nice.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. Should we invite her close friends only, or more people?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe only close friends? She like small group, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. What about food? Should we cook or order something?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I think order food is better. Like... pizza or biryani? Sara love biryani.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Biryani sounds great! Should we get a cake too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! Cake is good. Maybe chocolate... or, how to say, mango? She like mango cake.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Mango cake it is! What time should we plan the party?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe 7 o’clock? Sara finish work at 6, so she come... come home at 7.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That works. Should we decorate her flat?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! Balloons and... um, lights? Colourful lights?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll get the decorations. Do you want to be in charge of inviting everyone?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will do it. I send message to all friends.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And I’ll take care of the food and cake. Anything else we’re missing?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um... maybe music? Sara like... uh, old songs.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. I’ll make a playlist of her favorite old songs.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Good idea. I think she will be very happy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Let’s meet tomorrow to finalize everything, okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, okay. Tomorrow, same time, we meet. Thank you for your help!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you too, Ali! This is going to be a great party. See you tomorrow!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** See you tomorrow! Goodbye!
