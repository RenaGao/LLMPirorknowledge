**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can I help you with something? You look a bit lost.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes, thank you. I am trying to find... um, the big clock tower. How to say... the famous one?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you mean the Town Clock Tower? It’s a beautiful landmark!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, Town Clock Tower. I hear it is very nice. But I don’t know how to go there.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! It’s not too far. You’re on Main Street now, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I am here on Main Street. I walk from... um, the bus station.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, from here, go straight for two blocks. Then, turn left at the big bookstore. Do you see it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Bookstore... yes, I see. Go straight, left at bookstore. Then?

**Speaker A (NS):** After turning left, walk for about five minutes. You’ll see a park on your right. The clock tower is just past the park.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Park on right, then tower. Okay, I understand. Thank you so much!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Do you want me to repeat the directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, no, it’s fine. I will try. If I am lost again, I will ask someone.

**Speaker A (NS):** That works. Enjoy your visit to the clock tower! It’s really worth seeing.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I am excited. Thank you again for your help!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, you too! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
