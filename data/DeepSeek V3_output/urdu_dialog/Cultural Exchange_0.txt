**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I’ve heard Pakistan has some amazing festivals. Can you tell me about one?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, of course! One big festival is Eid-ul-Fitr. It comes after Ramadan, the month of fasting.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of Ramadan. How do people celebrate Eid?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** On Eid, we start with special namaz, um... prayer. Then, we wear new clothes and go to meet family and friends.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. Is there any special food?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes! We make sweets like... um... sewaiyan, it is like vermicelli with milk and sugar. Also, we give money to children, called "Eidi."  
**Speaker A (NS):** Eidi? That sounds fun. Is it like a gift?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is gift, but usually cash. Children are very happy for it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Do people decorate their homes for Eid?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, some people decorate with lights and, um... colorful things. But mostly, we focus on food and family.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful celebration. Is there a special meaning behind Eid?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is thanks to Allah for giving us strength during Ramadan. Also, it is time for forgiveness and... um... being kind to others.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really beautiful. Thank you for explaining!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome. I’m happy to tell you about Eid.  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s great to learn about different cultures. Maybe one day I can experience Eid in Pakistan.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, you must come! You will like it very much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to. Thanks again for sharing!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you for listening. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Let’s talk again soon.
