**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal! I heard you and your friends are planning a trip. Where are you thinking of going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! We are thinking to go... um, how to say... new city. Maybe... Lahore. It is very beautiful place.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Lahore sounds great! It’s known for its rich history and food. Do you know which places you want to visit?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we want to see... um, Badshahi Mosque. And also, how to say... Fort?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the Lahore Fort? That’s a must-see. It’s huge and full of history.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, exactly! And we also want to eat... um, famous food. Like... Nihari and Paratha.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great plan. Nihari is delicious! Have you thought about where to stay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Not yet. We are... um, thinking about hotel. But I don’t know which is best.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe you can check online reviews. There are many good hotels near the main attractions.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. I will do that. Thank you for... uh, giving idea.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! How are you planning to travel around the city?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We will use... um, how to say... car. One friend has car.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s convenient. Just be careful with the traffic in Lahore—it can get pretty busy.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I know. We will be careful. Um, how to say... take time, not hurry.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. Do you have any other activities planned?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we want to see... Anarkali Bazaar. For shopping. And maybe... uh, Gol Market.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great choices! You’ll find lots of interesting things there.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I hope so. Thank you for... um, helping me with plan.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! It sounds like you’ll have a lot of fun. Let me know if you need more advice.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will. Thank you so much. Now we feel more... um, ready for trip.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Have a wonderful time in Lahore.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! We will enjoy it a lot. See you soon!  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you! Take care and safe travels.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, I will. Goodbye!
