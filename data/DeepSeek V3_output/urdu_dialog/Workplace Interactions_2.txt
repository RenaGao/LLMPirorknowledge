**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ali! We need to plan the team meeting for next week. Do you have some time to discuss the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, of course. I can discuss. But, um... what is... agenda? I mean, what we need to talk in meeting?

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries. The agenda is just the list of topics we’ll discuss during the meeting. For example, project updates or new ideas. 

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I see. So, we can talk about... um, project update first? Then, maybe... new ideas from team?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that sounds good. Do we have any specific updates to share?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think. My team is... um, how to say... almost finish the report. We need to... uh, check it one more time. Maybe we can discuss in meeting?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s add that to the agenda. Should we also discuss deadlines for the next phase of the project?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is important. Also, maybe we can talk about... um, training for new software?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. We’ll add training to the list. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um... no, I think that is enough. Too many thing will make meeting long.

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. Let’s keep it focused. So, the agenda will be: project updates, deadlines, and training. Does that sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is very good. I will make notes and prepare for my part.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome. Thank you for your input, Ali. I’ll send you the final agenda tomorrow for your review.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you too. I will check it and tell you if I have any... uh, suggestion.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let me know if you need any help. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You also have a great day. See you in the meeting next week!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then. Take care!
