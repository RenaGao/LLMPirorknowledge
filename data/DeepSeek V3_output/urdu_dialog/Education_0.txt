**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Raza! How's your preparation going for the upcoming exam?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Ah, yes, preparation... it is, um, going okay. But I feel little nervous.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s understandable. What subjects are you focusing on?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I focus on, uh, mathematics and science. Science is... difficult for me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Science can be tricky. Do you need help with any specific topic?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, biology... the thing about cells and... how to say... their work?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, cell functions and processes?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! Cell functions. I read book, but not understand everything.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I can explain it to you. Maybe we can study together tomorrow?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That will be very helpful, thank you. What time you are free?  

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 3 PM? We can meet at the library.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, 3 PM is good. I will come to library.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any other questions about the exam?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. For mathematics, the... um, thing with shapes and angles...  

**Speaker A (NS):** Geometry?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, geometry. I find it... complicated.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, we can cover that too tomorrow.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you so much. You are very kind.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! It’s always good to study with a friend.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I agree. Studying alone is... boring.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, true. Alright, see you tomorrow at 3 PM then?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, see you tomorrow at library. Thank you again!  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Good luck with your studies, Raza!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I will try my best. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Take care.  

*The conversation ends with a clear plan to meet at the library the next day.*
