**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me about your favorite hobby?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, of course. My favorite hobby is... um, painting. I like to make art with colors.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! How long have you been painting?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think... about three year. I start in school, but now I do it in my free time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s impressive. What kind of things do you like to paint?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I paint... um, nature. Like trees, flowers, and sometimes river. It makes me feel calm.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s lovely. Do you paint from pictures or from real life?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Mostly from real life. But sometimes, if no time, I use... uh, how to say... photos? Yes, photos from my phone.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Do you have a favorite painting you’ve done?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I have one. It is... um, a sunset near my home. I use many colors like orange, pink, and yellow. It is my best work.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds beautiful! Do you share your paintings with others?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sometimes I show to my family and friends. They like it. But I feel shy to show... um, everyone.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s great that you share it with people you trust. Do you ever plan to do something more with your art?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe one day. I think about joining... art class, but I have no time now.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. Even small steps can help you grow. What do you enjoy most about painting?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I enjoy... how to say... it makes me forget problems. When I paint, I feel happy and relaxed.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s amazing. It’s a great way to express yourself. Thank you for sharing!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you for listening. It is good to talk about my hobby.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Maybe one day I’ll see your paintings in person. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, inshallah. Thank you, you also have a nice day!
