**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Ali! I’ve been meaning to talk to you about something. Is now a good time?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes, of course. What is the matter?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I feel like you’ve been avoiding me lately. Did I do something wrong?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, no, not at all! I just... um, was busy with my studies and family things. Sorry if I make you feel this way.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. I thought maybe I said something that upset you.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, no, you are always kind. I... uh, I was thinking you might be upset with me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Why did you think that?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Because, um, last time we meet, you seem... how to say... not happy. Maybe I talk too much about my problems.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, no! I wasn’t unhappy. I might have been tired that day, but I’m always happy to listen to you.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I see. I was worried I make you... uh, bored or something.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Not at all! I’m sorry if I gave you that impression. We’re good, right?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, of course! I feel much better now. Thank you for talking about this.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. I think it’s important to clear things up.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is. I’m glad we talk.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. By the way, do you want to grab coffee this weekend?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That sounds nice. Yes, let’s do it!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll text you the details.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will wait for your message. Thank you again for understanding.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! Talk to you soon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, talk soon. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Ali!
