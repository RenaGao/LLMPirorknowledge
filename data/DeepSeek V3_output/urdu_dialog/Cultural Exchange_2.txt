**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ali! I was wondering, what’s your favorite holiday in Pakistan?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, my favorite holiday is... Eid. Eid-ul-Fitr. It is very important in our culture.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds wonderful! What do you usually do on Eid?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We wear new clothes, go to mosque for prayer, and then... um, how to say... we visit family and friends. Also, we eat special food, like biryani and sweets.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! Do you give or receive gifts during Eid?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we give money... um, it’s called *Eidi*. Mostly, elders give to children. It is like... a blessing.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting! What makes Eid-ul-Fitr so special for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It is very happy time because... um, after fasting in Ramadan, we celebrate. Everyone is together, and people also help poor and needy. It is... how to say... a time of joy and sharing.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really beautiful. Do you also decorate your home for Eid?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we clean house and put lights, and sometimes... um, decorate with colorful things. It looks very nice.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to experience Eid in Pakistan someday. What would you recommend for someone visiting during that time?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, you must visit bazaars and see the... um, traditional clothes and food. Also, people are very friendly, so you will feel welcome.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing, Ali. Thank you for sharing!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You’re welcome. It was nice talking about Eid. Maybe one day you will come to Pakistan?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! I’ll let you know if I plan a trip. Thanks again, Ali. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, you too. Bye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
