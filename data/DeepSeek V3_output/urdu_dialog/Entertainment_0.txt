**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sana! How’s it going? I was wondering, what’s your favorite movie?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Ah, I like... um, how to say, a movie with action and emotion. I think it is called... *Dangal*. You know it?  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, *Dangal*! Yes, I’ve heard about it. It’s about wrestling, right?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! It is story of father who train his daughters for... um, sport wrestling. Very inspiring.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing. I love movies with strong messages. Do you watch TV shows too?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I watch TV shows. My favorite is... um, *Friends*. It is comedy, very funny.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, *Friends* is a classic! I’ve watched it too. Who’s your favorite character?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like Ross. He is... how to say... very smart, but sometimes too much funny.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I agree. Ross can be a little awkward. Do you watch any Pakistani dramas?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I watch some. *Zindagi Gulzar Hai* is one I like. It is about family and... um, life problems.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting. I’ll have to check it out. Do you prefer dramas or comedies?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, I like both. But dramas make me think more. Comedy is for relax.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Do you have a favorite actor or actress?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I like Mahira Khan. She is... um, very good actress. Her acting feels real.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve heard of her! She’s really talented. Do you watch movies in English too?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, but sometimes I need, um, subtitle. It helps me understand better.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great way to learn. Do you have a favorite English movie?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I like *The Pursuit of Happyness*. It is very... um, motivational.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great choice. It’s such a powerful story. Well, it’s been great talking about movies with you!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, thank you! I enjoy this talk. Maybe we can watch a movie together someday.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Let’s plan it soon. Take care, Sana!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, you too. Goodbye!
