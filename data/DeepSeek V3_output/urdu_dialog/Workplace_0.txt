**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal. How’s the progress on the client presentation?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello, sir. Yes, I am working on it. But, um... I need some more time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. What’s the issue? Is everything okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, mostly okay. But I have problem with one part. Graphs... how to say... they are not coming out good.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the graphs. Are they not aligning with the data?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes. The data is correct, but the graphs look... messy. I try to fix, but it take time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Do you need help with that? Maybe someone from the design team can assist?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Actually, yes. If someone can help, it will be very good.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’ll ask Sarah to check in with you. How much more time do you think you’ll need?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um... maybe two days? If Sarah help, I can finish fast.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I’ll adjust the deadline to Thursday. Does that work for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, Thursday is okay. Thank you, sir.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Just keep me updated if anything else comes up.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sure, I will update you. And thank you for understanding.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. You’re doing great, Bilal. Let’s wrap this up by Thursday.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will try my best. See you on Thursday.  
**Speaker A (NS):** See you then. Have a good day!  

**Conversation ends with a clear summary and expression of agreement.**
