**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Asim! How’s it going? I heard we have a test next week. Are you ready for it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Ah, yes, the test. I am... um, not fully ready yet. I have some problem with... how to say... the part of physics.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, which part of physics? Mechanics?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, mechanics. It is very... um, difficult for me. Equations, you know?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I get it. Mechanics can be tricky. Have you tried practicing problems from the textbook?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I try, but sometimes I cannot understand the... uh, process. Maybe I need more practice.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Why don’t we study together? We can go over the problems step by step.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That is very good idea! I think it will help me. When you are free?  

**Speaker A (NS):** How about tomorrow afternoon? We can meet in the library.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, okay. Tomorrow afternoon is fine. I will come to library after lunch.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any other topics you want to review?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe... chemistry also. The formula for, um... reactions. I forget them sometimes.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. We’ll go over those too. Just bring your notes and the textbook.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will bring everything. Thank you for helping me.  

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Remember, practice is key. Break the problems into smaller steps, and it’ll get easier.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will try. I feel more... um, confident now.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear. Good luck, and see you tomorrow at the library!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! See you tomorrow. We will study together and do well in test.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We’ve got this. Take care!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too! Bye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Asim. Good luck with your studies.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, I will do my best. See you tomorrow!  

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then. Have a good day!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too. Bye!
