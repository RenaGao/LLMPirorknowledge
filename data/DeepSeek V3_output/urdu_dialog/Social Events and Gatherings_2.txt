**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Nice to meet you. I’m Sarah. What’s your name?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello, my name is Ali. Nice meeting you also.  

**Speaker A (NS):** So, Ali, what do you like to do in your free time?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I like... um, reading books and sometimes watching films.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s great! What kind of books do you enjoy?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like, um, history and also Urdu poetry. It is very beautiful.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Urdu poetry? That sounds interesting. Do you write poems too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, no, I don’t write. But I... um, enjoy to read and understand meaning.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. And what about films? Do you have a favorite genre?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I like drama films. They are... uh, how to say... showing real life in Pakistan.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fascinating. I’ve actually never watched a Pakistani film. Do you have any recommendations?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes! You can watch *Khuda Kay Liye*. It is very good film.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll make sure to check it out! I’ve been looking for new films to watch. Do you like any other hobbies?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sometimes I play cricket. In Pakistan, it is very popular.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, cricket! I’ve heard it’s a huge sport there. Do you play often?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Not now, but I played many times in school. It was fun.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun. It’s great to find someone who enjoys reading and films as much as I do.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is nice to talk with you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here! I think we’ll get along well. Let’s stay in touch, Ali.
