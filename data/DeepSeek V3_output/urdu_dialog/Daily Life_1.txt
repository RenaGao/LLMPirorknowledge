**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Sana! How are you today?  
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Urdu):** Hello! I am fine, thank you. How are you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good, thanks. So, I heard you’re planning a picnic this weekend. That’s exciting!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I want to make picnic with my family. But I have some... um, how to say... confusion.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, sure. What are you confused about?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I not sure where is good place for picnic. Maybe park, but also I think about... um, near river.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Both sound nice. Do you want something quiet or more active?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Quiet, yes. My family like quiet place, with trees and... uh, open space.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Then the park might be better. You can sit under the trees and enjoy the shade.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is good idea. But what we take for food? I want to make it special.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Hmm, sandwiches are easy. Or maybe you could bring some traditional dishes?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! My mom make biryani very well. And maybe some... um, fried things? Like samosas.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Don’t forget drinks and snacks, too.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes. My brother like chips. And we can take... uh, cold drinks.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. What about games or activities?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think... it good to take ball for playing. And maybe cards game. We like to play cards.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fun. You’ll have a great time!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I hope so. Thank you for helping me. Now I feel more... um, confident about planning.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. I’m sure it’ll be wonderful. Have a great picnic!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! Now I go to make list for picnic. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Sana! Enjoy your weekend!
