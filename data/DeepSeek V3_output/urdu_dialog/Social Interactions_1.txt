**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Zain! I heard it’s Ali’s birthday next week. Have you thought about planning a surprise for him?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! I think we must do something special. Maybe... um, a party? But how to make it surprise?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! We could plan a small gathering at his favorite café. Do you know if that’s a place he’d like?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, café is good! Ali always go there for coffee. But I worry, um, how to bring him there without he suspect?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Hmm, good point. We could tell him we’re meeting for a group project or something. Would that work?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is clever. I will say... um, "Let’s meet for study." Then he will not know it is party.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Should we invite a few more friends? Maybe Sara and Ahmed? They’re close to Ali too.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, Sara and Ahmed must come. They are... um, his *yaar*—his close friends.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great, I’ll text them. And for the party, do you want to bring a cake or something else?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Cake is very good. I will bring chocolate cake. Ali like chocolate very much.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! I’ll handle decorations and balloons. Do you think we should do anything else, like a gift?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, gift. Maybe something for his hobby? He love... um, how to say... books about history?  
**Speaker A (NS):** History books, got it. I’ll find one. And I’ll also bring a card for everyone to sign.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That is very nice. I think Ali will be very happy. He will not expect this!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Let’s keep it a secret until the day. I’ll confirm the time and place with everyone tomorrow.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will also help. Thank you for planning with me. This will be a very good birthday for Ali.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! It’s going to be a lot of fun. Let’s keep in touch and make sure it all goes smoothly.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will talk to Sara and Ahmed too. We will make it great. Bye-bye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Zain! See you soon, and let’s make Ali’s birthday unforgettable.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, together we will make it the best surprise for him. See you tomorrow!
