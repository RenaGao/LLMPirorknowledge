**Conversation: Learning a New Skill**

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Nice to meet you. Could you tell me about a skill you’d like to learn and why it’s important to you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. I want to learn... um, how to say... the skill for making food, like professional.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, cooking?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, cooking. I like to eat good food, but... um, I not know to make it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting. Why do you think it’s important to learn cooking?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Because... um, in my culture, food is very important. When I can cook, I can make food for my family and friends. It is like... showing love.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a very nice reason. Do you have a specific type of food you’d like to cook?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I want to learn to make... um, traditional food from my country. Like biryani.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, biryani is delicious! What’s stopping you from learning now?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think... um, I not have time. And maybe... I feel it is difficult.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. But if you start small, like learning one recipe, it can be less overwhelming.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, you are right. I can try one dish, like biryani. Maybe I watch video on YouTube.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! Videos are really helpful. Do you have anyone who can help you cook?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** My mother is very good cook. She can teach me, but... um, she live far.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Maybe you could call her while you cook?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes! That is good idea. I will call her.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. I’m sure you’ll do great. Cooking is such a useful skill.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I think... it will make me happy to cook for others.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure it will. Good luck with your cooking journey!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! I will try my best.  

**Speaker A (NS):** It was great talking to you. Take care!  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, thank you. You also take care. Goodbye!  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
