**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m interested in this scarf. How much is it?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, hello! It is... um, very nice scarf. Special price for you, 20 dollar.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Twenty dollars? Seems a bit high. Can you lower the price?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm... okay. Maybe, 18 dollar? It is good quality, very soft.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I like it, but I’m thinking more like 15 dollars. Is that okay?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Fifteen? It is... um, very less price. How about 16 dollar? Final offer.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sixteen dollars? Alright, I can do that. Do you take cash?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, cash is okay. Thank you, sir. You need bag also?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, please. That would be great. Here’s the money.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you so much. Here is your scarf and bag. Come again, okay?  
**Speaker A (NS):** I will. Thanks for a good deal. Have a great day!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You also have good day, sir. Bye-bye!  

The conversation ends with both speakers agreeing on the price and bidding each other farewell politely.
