**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Hassan! How have you been?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! I am... um, fine, but feeling little tired. Always busy with work.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Are you taking care of yourself?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Not much. I think I am, how to say, not eating good food and no exercise.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s not good. Staying healthy is important for work and life.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I know. But... um, I don’t have time for this.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You can start small. Like eating fruits or walking for 10 minutes.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, walking is good. In my city, my friend also say to walk. But I... um, I feel lazy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** It’s okay to feel lazy sometimes. But try to make it a habit. You’ll feel better.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will try. First, I will eat fruits. Like apple and orange.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great start! And don’t forget to drink water.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, water is important. I forget to drink it, but now I will remember.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Good! Also, try to sleep on time. It helps a lot.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. I sleep late because of work. But I will try to sleep early.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s the spirit! Small changes make a big difference.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you for advice. I will follow it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let me know how it goes.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will tell you. Okay, I must go now. See you later!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Hassan! Goodbye!  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Goodbye! Stay healthy too!
