**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sarah! I noticed you seemed upset during our last conversation. Is everything okay?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, I... um, I think there was misunderstanding. I not want to make you feel bad.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Can you tell me what happened?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes. When you say I must be on time, I feel like... how to say... you say I am always late. But I try to be on time always.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’m sorry if it came across that way. I didn’t mean to imply you’re always late. I was just reminding everyone about the meeting time.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, I understand now. I think I... um, take it personal. But you mean for everyone.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. I’m glad we cleared that up. I value your effort and wouldn’t want you to feel singled out.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is good we talk. I feel better now. Thank you for explaining.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Sarah. I’m glad we could resolve this. Shall we move on and have a great day?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, let’s have good day. I feel happy we fix this misunderstanding.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! See you later, Sarah.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** See you later! Take care.
