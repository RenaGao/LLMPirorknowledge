**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sana! Do you have a moment to talk about the project deadlines?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes, I have time. Please, tell me what is... um, deadline for this?  
**Speaker A (NS):** The project is due next Friday. Have you started working on your part?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I start already. But I have some... problem. How to say... some tasks are difficult for me.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Which tasks are giving you trouble? Maybe I can help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, the report writing. I am not good in English, so it is taking... much time.  
**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! I can review your draft and help if needed. Do you have the outline ready?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Outline? Um, yes, I make structure. I will send it to you?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Send it over, and I’ll check it by tomorrow. How about the data analysis part? Is that going well?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Data analysis is... okay. I finish half. But I need more time for conclusion.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good progress. Let me know if you need help with the conclusion.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you so much! You are very kind.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! We’re a team, after all. Anything else you’re concerned about?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, no, I think everything is okay now. I will send you outline today.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s meet again on Thursday to finalize everything. Does that work for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, Thursday is okay. I will be ready then.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome. Thanks for working hard on this, Sana. I appreciate it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you for helping me. I am... um, very happy to work with you.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Same here! See you on Thursday, and let’s finish this project strong.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, see you Thursday. We will finish it together!
