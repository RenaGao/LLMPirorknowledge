**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It’s great to meet you. Can you tell me about your favorite place to visit?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, my favorite place is... um, how to say... a hill station. It is called Murree.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Murree? I’ve heard of it. Is it in Pakistan?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is in north of Pakistan. The view is very... very beautiful. You can see the snowy mountains and trees.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! What do you like to do there?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like to... um, walk on Mall Road. And sometimes, I take photos. The air is clean and fresh.  

**Speaker A (NS):** It must be very peaceful. Do you go there often?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Not so much now. Before, I go with my family every year. Now, I am busy with work and... um, other things.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. What makes Murree so special to you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It is special because... uh, it makes me feel peaceful. Also, I have many good memories with my family there.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s lovely. It sounds like a meaningful place for you.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is. I hope one day I can visit again.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you will! Maybe you could plan a trip soon.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will try. Thank you for asking about it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for sharing! It was really nice to hear about Murree.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome. It is nice to talk with you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Let’s catch up again sometime.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sure, that would be good.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, and I hope you get to visit Murree soon!  

**The conversation ends with Speaker A expressing a hopeful wish for Speaker B’s future visit to Murree.**
