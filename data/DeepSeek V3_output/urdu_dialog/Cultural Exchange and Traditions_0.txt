**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’ve heard that your culture has some beautiful traditions. Could you tell me about one?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, sure! In my country, we have... um, Eid. It is very big festival. We celebrate after Ramadan.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Eid! I’ve heard about it. What do you usually do during Eid?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We wake up early, wear new clothes, and go mosque for special prayer. After that, we meet family and eat... um, how to say... delicious food.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! What kind of food do you eat?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We have biryani, kebabs, and sweet... um, what is word? Sweet... like milk and sugar...  
**Speaker A (NS):** Are you thinking of desserts like kheer or sheer khurma?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! Sheer khurma. It is very traditional for Eid.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! Do you exchange gifts too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we give Eidi. It is... um, money given to children and young people. They feel very happy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s such a nice tradition. Do you also visit friends and neighbors?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we visit everyone. We say "Eid Mubarak" and share sweets and... um, how to say... happiness.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. It sounds like a very joyous time. How long does Eid last?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It is for three days, but first day is most important. Everyone is very excited for it.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! Thank you for sharing. It sounds like a beautiful festival.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome. Maybe one day you can come and see it. You will like it, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to! Thanks again for explaining it so well. Let’s catch up again soon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, sure. Thank you for listening. Okay, I will see you later!
