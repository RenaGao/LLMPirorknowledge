**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thanks for meeting with me today! I’d love to hear your ideas for the cultural event. What traditions would you like to share?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, yes. I want to share... um, how to say... our food and music. Pakistani food is very tasty. And music is... um, traditional.  
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! Any specific dishes or instruments?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, like biryani and qorma. And music, uh, we use tabla and sitar. Very nice, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve heard of biryani. It’s delicious! How about activities? Should we include a cooking demo or a music performance?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, cooking demo is good. People can see how to make food. And also, maybe... um, dance? We have traditional dance like bhangra.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Bhangra? That sounds fun! Do you think you can teach some basic steps?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I can try. It is easy but very... um, lively. People will enjoy, I think.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Should we include a little presentation about the culture too?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, good idea. I can tell about festivals like Eid and... um, how we celebrate with family and friends.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. How about decorations? Should we use traditional things?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we can use... um, lanterns and colorful cloth. It makes place look happy.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I love that! What’s the best day to hold this event?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe weekend? Saturday is good. People are not working.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Saturday works for me. Let’s set it for two weeks from now.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is good. I will prepare and tell my friends also.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! I’ll handle the invitations and venue. Anything else you’d like to add?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe we can have... um, small gift for people? Like bracelet or... um, how to say... something to remember.  
**Speaker A (NS):** A souvenir? That’s a nice touch. Let’s include that.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, souvenir. Thank you for your help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! This is going to be a fantastic event. Let’s meet again next week to finalize the details.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, okay. I will see you next week. Goodbye!  
**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Looking forward to it!  

The conversation ends with a plan to meet again and a friendly farewell.
