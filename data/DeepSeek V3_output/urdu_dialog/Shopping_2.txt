**Speaker A (NS, Store Employee):** Hello! How can I help you today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello, um... I have this thing... thing I buy from here. I want to... return it.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Do you have the receipt with you?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I have it. It is... in my bag. One moment, please. *[Pause]* Here.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thank you. Can I ask why you’re returning it?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It is... not working. When I take home, it doesn’t do the... uh, the work it should do.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Is it defective or damaged?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, defective. It is not broken, but it doesn’t... function.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Let me check this for you. [Pause to examine the item] Alright, since it’s defective and you have the receipt, I can process a full refund.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, thank you. How I get the money back?  

**Speaker A (NS):** It’ll go back to the card you used for the purchase. Is that okay?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is fine.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let me just scan this... [Pause] Alright, it’s done. You should see the refund in 3-5 business days.  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, good. Thank you for help.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Is there anything else I can help you with today?  

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, that is all. Thank you again. Goodbye.  

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Have a great day, and take care.
