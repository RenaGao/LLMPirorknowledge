**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sarah! It’s been so long since we last talked. How are you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Yes, it is... um, very long time. I am fine, thank you. How are you?  

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. How’s everything going back home?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Everything is good. Uh, my family is fine. But... how to say... work is very busy now.  

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! Are you still working at the same place?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, same place. But now I have more... um, responsibility. It is little difficult.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s great, though! It shows they trust you. How’s your little one doing?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, my son? He is very good. He started school now. He is... um, learning ABC and... numbers?  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful! I’m sure he’s enjoying it. Are you helping him with his studies?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I try. But sometimes I... um, how to say... forget English words. It is... funny.  

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) I’m sure you’re doing a great job. Kids pick up things so fast.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! He learn very fast. I am happy.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so nice to hear. We should plan to meet up soon. It’s been too long.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I like this idea. Um, maybe next month? I can visit you.  

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect! Let’s check the dates and finalize it.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will... um, message you later. We can decide.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! It was so good catching up with you, Sarah. Take care, and give my love to the family.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! I will. You also take care. Goodbye for now.  

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Sarah! Looking forward to meeting you soon.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, me too. Goodbye!  

The conversation ends with a clear plan to reconnect and expressions of care and goodbye.
