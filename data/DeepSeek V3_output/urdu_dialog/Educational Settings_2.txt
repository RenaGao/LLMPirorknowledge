**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ali! How’s the preparation for the exam going?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, hi! It is... um, a bit difficult. I try to understand... uh, how to say, the topic of... um, chemistry reaction?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Chemical reactions?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! Chemical reactions. I read about it, but still not fully clear.  
**Speaker A (NS):** I get it. What part is confusing for you?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** The thing... uh, how the elements... um, change their form. I mean, how they become different after reaction.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean how reactants turn into products?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Exactly! This is the point. How to explain it?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Well, think of it like baking a cake. You mix ingredients, and after heating, it becomes a cake. The ingredients change into something new.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I see! So, the... um, elements mix and make new thing. Like, hydrogen and oxygen make water.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly! That’s a great example.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** So, it is like... um, the atoms rearrange themselves?  
**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! They rearrange to form new substances. Does that make more sense now?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! Now I can understand better. Thank you so much!  
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Do you want to go over another topic?  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, not now. I think I need some time to... um, to practice this one first.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, take your time. Let me know if you need more help.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! You explain very well. I will, um, meet you again if I have more questions.  
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! See you later, Ali.  
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** See you later! Thank you for your help.  
**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Good luck with your studies!
