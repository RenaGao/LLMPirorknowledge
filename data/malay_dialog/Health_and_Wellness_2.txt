peaker A (NS):** Hi there! Welcome to the gym. How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, hello. I want to start exercise. I not sure... where to begin?

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! Do you have any specific fitness goals in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to... how to say... be more strong and... um, lose some weight.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great goals! We can create a routine to help you with that. How often are you thinking of coming to the gym?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe... three time a week?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good. Have you done any workouts before?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, not much... sometimes jogging in park, but not regular.

**Speaker A (NS):** Jogging is a good start! Do you prefer working out alone or in a group?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think... alone is better. I can think more... uh, focus?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, solo workouts can be very focused. Would you like to include weight training?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, but I not know how to use... um, machine.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay, I can show you how to use them safely. What about cardio exercises?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, I like. Maybe cycling? It is... fun for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Cycling is excellent for cardio. We can include it in your routine. Do you have any dietary preferences or restrictions?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I try to eat... more vegetable and fruit. Less fried food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a healthy start. Balancing your diet with your workouts will help you achieve your goals faster.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I not know much about food for exercise.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. We can also discuss meal planning later if you're interested.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, please. I want to learn more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let's set up your schedule and get started with some basic exercises today.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I ready! Thank you for helping me.

**Speaker A (NS):** My pleasure! Let's make sure you enjoy the proce
