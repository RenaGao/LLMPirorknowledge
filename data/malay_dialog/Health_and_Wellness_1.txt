peaker A (NS):** Hey, Farah! It's been a while. How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi, Aiman! Um, I am good, but... how to say... a bit tired these days.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you getting enough rest?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not really. I sleep late. Uh, I watch too many series at night.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. Maybe try to set a bedtime routine? It can help you sleep better.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That's good idea. I should... um, close my phone early, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly! And maybe read a book instead. Itâ€™s more relaxing.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think I will try that. Any other tips for... um, health?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Are you drinking enough water? Staying hydrated is important.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, sometimes I forget. How much should I drink again?

**Speaker A (NS):** Generally, about eight glasses a day. But it can depend on activities.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will try to remember. What about, um, exercise?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exercise is great! Do you manage to fit in any workouts?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I walk... sometimes. But not much else.

**Speaker A (NS):** Walking is good! Maybe try some light stretches or yoga at home?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yoga... sounds nice. I can... um, watch online videos?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, definitely. There are many beginner-friendly videos online.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, Aiman. I feel... how to say... motivated now!

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to hear that, Farah! Small changes can make a big difference.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will start today. Thank you for your advice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Farah! Let me know how it goes, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I will. See you soon, Aiman! Thank you aga
