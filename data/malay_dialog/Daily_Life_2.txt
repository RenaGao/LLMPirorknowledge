peaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for helping with dinner tonight! I heard you have a favorite meal you like to prepare. Can you tell me about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, my favorite meal is nasi lemak. It is, um, rice with coconut... coconut, uh, flavor. Very popular in Malaysia.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! How do you start preparing it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** First, I cook rice with coconut milk. Need to, um, wash rice and then add coconut milk and water. A bit of salt also.

**Speaker A (NS):** So, the coconut milk makes the rice taste different, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, very creamy and... um, rich taste. You must try!

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to! What comes next after the rice?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Next, I prepare sambal. It's... uh, spicy chili sauce. Very... um, how to say... important for nasi lemak.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. How do you make the sambal?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Use chili, onion, garlic, and some... um, shrimp paste. Blend it and then cook with oil and... sugar, maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, it sounds flavorful. Do you add anything else to the dish?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I add fried anchovies, peanuts, and boiled egg. Sometimes cucumber too, for fresh taste.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a complete meal. Do you cook this often?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, not every day. Maybe... once a week. It is special, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It sounds like a lot of care goes into making it. How long does it usually take?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe one hour? Depends how fast I cook. But worth the time!

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely sounds worth it! Do you think I could help next time?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, of course. I can show you how to cook sambal. It's... um, fun when cooking together.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Maybe we can make it for dinner tomorrow?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, sure. We can go shopping for ingredients first.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great plan! I’m excited to try cooking nasi lemak with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I hope you will like it. It is very... um, how to say... meaningful to share this food with y
