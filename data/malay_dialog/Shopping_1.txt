peaker A (NS):** Hi there! How's your day going?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! Um, it's good. Just looking around market, see what is... uh, interesting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Are you looking for something specific today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to buy... how you say... basket for fruit, lah?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, a fruit basket. I see. Have you found one you like?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I see one very nice. But, um, the price is... a bit high, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you want to try negotiating the price? I can give you some tips if you’d like.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, please! I not so good at this, often too shy.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! Start by asking if they can offer a better price. Maybe say, "Is there a discount for this?"

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, let me try. Um... is there discount for this basket?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good start! Did they say anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, he say, uh, only small discount. So I ask more?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, you can say, "Can you give a larger discount if I buy more items?"

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Alright. Can you give... larger discount if I buy more things?

**Speaker A (NS):** How did that go?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** He say okay, can give... bigger discount, but only if I buy three items.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice! Do you think you can find two more items you like?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think so. Maybe I look for... uh, more kitchen things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! Once you choose, just confirm the total price before you pay.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will do that. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Let me know if you need more help. Good luck with your shopping!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thanks again. I will try my best. Have nice day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Enjoy the mark
