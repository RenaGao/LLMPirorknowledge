peaker A (NS):** Hi Maria, I heard you wanted to discuss something with me. Is everything okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi, um... yes, I want to talk about the report. I make mistake in data.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. What happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I, um, use wrong numbers for the sales... figures. I, how to say... I sorry for this.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's alright, Maria. Mistakes happen. How did you realize there was an error?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I check again, and my colleague also say something not... match. So, I find the mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad you caught it. Do you know how we can fix it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think I can correct numbers and, um, update report. But it take... some time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good plan. How much time do you think you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe, um, two days? I want to be sure it is correct this time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Two days sounds reasonable. Do you need any help with it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Uh, maybe I need help to check again after I finish? Just to be sure all is right.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I can review it once you're done. Anything else we should consider?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think I will also add note in report about mistake and correction, so all know.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. Transparency is important. Is there a way to prevent this in the future?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I will make checklist, so I not miss... um, step next time. And double-check numbers.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a proactive approach. It shows you’re learning from this.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to do better. Thank you for understanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Maria. Everyone makes mistakes, but learning from them is key.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I agree. Thank you for your support.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime. Let’s meet again in two days to go over the updated report.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, see you then. Thank you aga
