peaker A (NS):** Hey, Farah, thanks for meeting. We need to plan the surprise birthday for Aiman. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, yes, I think we can, uh, do party at his house. But, uh, not sure how to ask his family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea. We can maybe talk to his sister. Sheâ€™s usually very helpful. Do you think you can contact her?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I can try. I will, um, message her later. What about, uh, food? He like spicy food, kan?

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, he loves spicy food. How about we order from that new restaurant he wanted to try?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! The one with, um, spicy chicken. I think he will like that.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. What about decorations? Should we keep it simple or go all out?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe simple but nice. We can, uh, use balloons and... um, banner?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, balloons and a banner sound good. Do you have any idea for the theme?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, maybe... oh, he like sports. We can do something with... um, football theme?

**Speaker A (NS):** Football theme sounds fun! We could get some mini footballs as decorations too.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, good idea! We also need, um, music. He like what type of music?

**Speaker A (NS):** He usually enjoys pop music. We can make a playlist with his favorite songs.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I can help with that. Maybe I can ask a few friends for song ideas.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What about the time? When should we start the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe, um, start at 5 p.m.? So, we have time for, uh, eat and talk before he come.

**Speaker A (NS):** 5 p.m. sounds good. Do you think we need any games or activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe some games. If we have... um, football theme, we can play like... small game outside?

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent idea! A friendly match would be fun. Maybe we can even organize a little tournament.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is good. I think Aiman will be happy. I will, uh, start planning the message to his sister now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let me know what she says. Thanks for all your help, Far
