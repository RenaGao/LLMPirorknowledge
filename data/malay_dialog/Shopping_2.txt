**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, hi. I buy... a shirt last week. But problem, it is too small.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. You’d like to return it, then?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, can return? I not sure about the rule.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! Do you have the receipt with you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I have. Here it is.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you. Let me check it for you. Did you wear the shirt, or is it still in new condition?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I try only. Just try in home. Still new, yes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! As long as it’s unworn and with tags, you can return it. Did you want to exchange it for a different size?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, yes, I want bigger size. Maybe one size up.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright. Let me see if we have the size you need. Do you remember the size you wanted?
