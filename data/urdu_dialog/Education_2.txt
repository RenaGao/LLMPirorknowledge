**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What part of the assignment do you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It's, uh, the math problem. I not understand how to, um, solve it.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Which math problem is it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It is the one with, um, triangles and angles. I think number five.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the geometry problem. Have you tried using the Pythagorean theorem?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Pythagorean... um, I not sure what it mean.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s a formula to find the length of sides in a right triangle. Do you want me to explain it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, please. I not remember how it work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, the theorem says that a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse. Do you see it in your problem?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, but I confuse about which is hypotenuse.

**Speaker A (NS):** The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. It’s the longest one.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, I see now. So, I put numbers in this formula?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Do you want to try solving it with me?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, please. I have side a is 3 and side b is 4.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, 3² + 4² equals what?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, 9 plus 16. That is 25.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! So, what is the square root of 25?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** The square root... uh, it is 5?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s right! So, the hypotenuse c is 5.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! Now I understand better.
