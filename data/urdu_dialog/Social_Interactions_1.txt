peaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you ready to talk about the birthday surprise for our friend?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I am ready. Um, how we start this plan?

**Speaker A (NS):** First, let's decide on the place. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hm, maybe we use the park? It is big and open place.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! Which park were you thinking of?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think, um... the one near the library. It is nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the Central Park? I think our friend would love that.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, Central Park! What about, um, food? We should have food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Do you think we should order pizza or go for something homemade?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Pizza is good, but maybe we, uh, make some food also? Like biryani?

**Speaker A (NS):** Biryani is a great choice! It's always a hit. Who will help with cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I can cook biryani! Maybe others can bring drinks and, um, cake?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I'll check with everyone about drinks and the cake. What about decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Decorations, yes. We need balloons and some lights, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good idea. I can get balloons. Do you have lights?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I have some lights from last festival. We can use them.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, we have the place, food, and decorations. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, what about music? We need music, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, music is essential! Do you have a playlist in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I can make playlist. But, um, need speaker for sound.

**Speaker A (NS):** I have a portable speaker we can use. Iâ€™ll bring it along.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! This will be fun, I hope friend is surprised.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure they'll love it. Let's finalize everything and meet again soon to prep!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, let's meet soon. Thank you for helping with pl
