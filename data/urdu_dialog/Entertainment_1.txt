peaker A (NS):** Hi Ahmed! How's it going? Any plans for this evening?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Um, I am good, thank you. I was thinking... maybe we go out to eat?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! Do you have any particular restaurant in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, I like the... uh, the place with spicy food. How to say... like biryani?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you're thinking of that new Indian restaurant on Main Street?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! That the one. I hear they have very good... uh, how to say... flavors?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, they do have great flavors. Should we make a reservation?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe not need? We can just go and see if place is busy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, that works. What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** How about, um, 7 o'clock? Is it good for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. And after dinner, do you want to do anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe we can... um, see movie? Or go for... uh, sweet things?

**Speaker A (NS):** A movie sounds fun. Any particular one you want to watch?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I not sure of names. But something... how to say, with action?

**Speaker A (NS):** An action movie it is, then. I can check the listings for us.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! And, um, if it late, we can just have dessert nearby?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. There's a nice dessert caf√© right next to the theater.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I know that place! They have very nice... uh, cakes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, dinner at 7, followed by a movie and dessert. Sounds like a plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, very good plan! I will see you at restaurant.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you there, Ahmed! Looking forward to it.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Me too! Thank you for help with plan.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! Bye for now.
