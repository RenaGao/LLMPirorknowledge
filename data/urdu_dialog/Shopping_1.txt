peaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you looking to buy something today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, uh, hello. I want to buy this, um, how to say... vase?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, yes, the vase. It's quite beautiful, isn't it? Do you know how much it costs?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I see price, but I think it is... um, too high? Maybe I can... talk about price?

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean you’d like to negotiate the price? Sure, that’s common in markets.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, negotiate. This word. How much can I, um, offer?

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe start a bit lower than the price they ask. Have you done this before?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** In Pakistan, yes, we do a lot. Here, um, not much experience.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay. Just be polite and state your offer confidently. Have you tried asking the seller yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I, um, not yet. Bit nervous maybe.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! Let's practice. What would you like to say?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I say, “Can you give this for lesser price?” Is it right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start! You might say, “Could you offer a discount on this?”

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, “offer a discount.” Thank you. I will try now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Remember to smile; it helps. What did the seller say?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, he say price can be, um, reduced a little. Like five percent.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start. You could ask if they can go a bit lower, maybe ten percent?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I ask again. He say, uh, okay, but final price.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful! You’ve done well. Are you happy with the price now?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, happy now. Thank you for help. I learn new, um, way today.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Enjoy your new vase. You handled it really well.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I feel more, um, confident now. Have a good day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Take care and happy shoppi
