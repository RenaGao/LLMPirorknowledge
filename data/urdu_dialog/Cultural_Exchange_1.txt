**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. Uh, I was thinking about, um, dining... dining way? In different countries.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean dining etiquette? That's interesting! What brought that to mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, etiquette! I watch a show, and it show how people eat in, um, places like France and Japan. Very different!

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, it's fascinating! What differences stood out to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** In France, they use many, um, forks and knives. And in Japan, they use chopsticks, no forks. It is... how to say... elegant.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right. The French dining set-up is quite elaborate. Have you tried using chopsticks before?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I try once, very difficult! I drop food many times. But it is fun to try.

**Speaker A (NS):** It takes practice! What about in Pakistan? How do dining customs compare?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, in Pakistan, we eat with hands sometimes, right hand. It is, um, more... how you say... personal? Like connecting with food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, using hands can make the experience more intimate. Are there specific rules you follow?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we not use left hand, it is seen not proper. And we share food, like family style, big plates in middle.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's wonderful. Sharing food seems to create a sense of community. Do you find it important?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is like bonding, talking with family. Um, you have same in your family?

**Speaker A (NS):** In my family, we do a mix. Sometimes we share, other times individual plates. It depends on the occasion.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I see. And, um, tipping? It is different too, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, tipping customs vary greatly. In the US, it's almost expected, but not so much in other countries.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** In Pakistan, we give tip, but it is not always. More like thank you for good service.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. It's a gesture of appreciation. Do you think these experiences change when you travel?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, when travel, I try follow local way. It is, um, respectful? And I learn a lot.
