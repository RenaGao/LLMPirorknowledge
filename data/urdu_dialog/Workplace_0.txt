peaker A (NS):** Hi Ahmed, do you have a moment to discuss the project deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, yes, sure. I wanted to talk about that. The deadline, it's, um, very close, no?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it is. We’re aiming to finish by next Friday. Do you think that’s feasible?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I think maybe it's bit difficult. The team is working hard, but, uh, there are... how to say... some issues?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Could you tell me more about the issues you're facing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, so, uh, the first is with the, um, software. It have some bugs we not, uh, expected.

**Speaker A (NS):** Bugs can be troublesome. Have you been able to identify their source?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, some bugs from the new update. We, uh, fixing them now, but it take time.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Is there anything I can do to help speed up the process?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, maybe, um, extra support? Like, another person to assist with testing.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. I’ll see if someone can join the team temporarily. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, and, uh, the data for analysis. We still waiting for, um, some files.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, right. Have you reached out to the data team about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I send them email, but, uh, no reply yet. Maybe you can, um, follow up?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I’ll contact them today. Do you feel there are other risks to the timeline?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, I think not big risks. Just need more, um, focus and time.
