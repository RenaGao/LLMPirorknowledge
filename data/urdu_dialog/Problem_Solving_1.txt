peaker A (NS):** Hello! Thank you for reaching out to customer service. How can I assist you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes. I am having a problem with my, uh, computer. It is not, um, starting.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Can you describe what happens when you try to turn it on?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** When I push the button, it is only, um, light blink and then nothing. No screen showing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's see if we can troubleshoot this. Have you checked if the power cable is properly connected?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I check. It is all fine. Plug in the wall and in the computer.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Next, have you tried using a different power outlet?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, no. I not try that. Should I change it now?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, please try that. Sometimes the issue can be with the outlet itself.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, one moment... Um, still same problem. Light blink again, no start.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for checking. It could be a battery issue if it’s a laptop. Is it plugged in directly, or is the battery removable?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It is laptop, but battery is inside. Not able to take out.

**Speaker A (NS):** Understood. Let's try a power reset. Turn off the laptop, disconnect the power cable, then press and hold the power button for about 15 seconds.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I do this... Press and hold... Um, now what?

**Speaker A (NS):** Now reconnect the power cable and try turning it on again.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Let me see... Ah, okay, it start! I see the logo now.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great to hear! It looks like the power reset helped. Is the screen working fine now?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, screen is showing. Thank you very much for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! If you have any more issues, feel free to contact us anytime.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes. I will do. Thank you for patience and help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Have a great day ahead!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, you t
