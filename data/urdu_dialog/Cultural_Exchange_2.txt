peaker A (NS):** Hi! I'm curious about cultural traditions. What's your favorite holiday in your country?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, hello! Yes, my favorite holiday... it is Eid. You know Eid?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I’ve heard about it. Can you tell me more about what you do during Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sure, sure. On Eid, we... um, we meet family. We eat much food! Sweet dishes, like... like sheer khurma.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Is there a special tradition or activity you do with your family?
