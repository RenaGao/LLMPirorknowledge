Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. How you are?
Yes, yes. What is it? You look little worried.
Oh, I am so sorry! I forget about it. I have very busy day. Um, my... how to say... my grandmother was not feeling well.
Yes, she is better now. I should tell you before, I know. I feel very bad about it.
I really sorry. Can we meet this weekend instead? I promise I will not forget.
Yes, picnic sound nice. I bring Korean food, okay?
Um, how about... one o'clock?
Me too. Thank you for understanding. I will not forget this time.
Yes, see you then. Goodbye!
