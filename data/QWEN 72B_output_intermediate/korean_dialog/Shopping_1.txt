Yes, um... hi. I want to buy this... um, how to say... this thing. It is nice. [Pointing to a handmade lamp]
Yes, it is very... um, beautiful. I like it. But, um, I think... the price is a little... how to say... high.
Fifty... um, dollars. I see. Can you... um, make it a little lower? Maybe... um, thirty-five dollars?
Um, forty dollars... I... I can... how to say... I can agree to that. It is fair.
Yes, please. Can I have... um... one bag?
No, I think... um, this is all. Thank you... um... very much.
You too. Goodbye!
