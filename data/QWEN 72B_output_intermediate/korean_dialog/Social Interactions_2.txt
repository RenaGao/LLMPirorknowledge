Hi, Sarah! Um, I am good. How you are?
Life is... um, very busy. I have many work to do. But also, very nice. How about you?
Oh, um, that sound good! I have some free time this weekend. How we meet?
Video call, that good idea. I like. Um, what time we call?
Yes, 2 p.m. is fine. I can... how to say... adjust my schedule.
Um, no big plan. Maybe I go to Han River with my friend. We like to ride... how to say... bicycle.
Yes, weather is very nice. We plan to eat chicken while we ride. Um, like picnic.
We usually buy from... um, restaurant. It is more easy and tasty.
Um, yes, there is one place near Han River. Name is... how to say... "Chicken Paradise." Very good!
Yes, you should. It will be very nice experience.
Yes, me too. I look forward to talk with you. Um, see you then!
You too, Sarah. Bye!
