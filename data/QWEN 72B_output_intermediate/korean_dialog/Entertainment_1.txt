Um, hi! Not much, just thinking about... um, how to say... chilling at home. How about you?
Oh, sure! Where you want to go?
Italian? I love Italian food! But, um, I heard they also have good Korean food at the market. Maybe we can go there?
Fusion place? That sounds interesting! But are they expensive?
Happy hour? What is that?
Oh, I see. That’s good. What time happy hour start?
Like what? We can go to karaoke or, um, how to say... bowling?
Yes, let’s do karaoke first and then bowling. That will be so much fun!
Sounds good! I’ll be there. See you then!
Thank you! See you then!
