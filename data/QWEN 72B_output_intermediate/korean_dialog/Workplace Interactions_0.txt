Hi, I am good. Thanks for asking. Um, how to say... today is little bit busy, but good.
Yes, I have time. Sure, what you want to talk about?
Yes, that is correct. We need to finish it by Friday.
It is going good. I finish most of it. I just need to check some detail... um, how to say... some details.
Okay, I will. Um, I have question about the format. Should we use APA or MLA?
Got it. APA. Thank you. And what about the references?
Yes, I will do that. I also want to add some chart... um, how to say... some charts and graphs.
Yes, I will. Um, how to say... one more thing. Can we meet tomorrow to go over the draft together?
How about afternoon? Two o'clock?
Okay, I will be there. Thanks.
You too. Bye!
