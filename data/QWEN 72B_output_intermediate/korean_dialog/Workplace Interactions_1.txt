Hi! I am good. Thank you. How are you?
Um, yes, I have. I use... uh, how to say... Trello?
Yes, um, how to start? What I need to do first?
Okay, I understand. Then, what is next step?
Ah, I see. So, I wait for your email with link?
Yes, I understand. Tasks have... um, description and due date. How to update task?

Thank you. I will try my best to learn and use it well.
Yes, that sounds good. Thank you for your help.
You too. Goodbye!
