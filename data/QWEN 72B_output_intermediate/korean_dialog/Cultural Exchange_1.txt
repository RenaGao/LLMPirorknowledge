Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, that sounds good! Um, how to say... dining etiquette is very important in Korea, you know.
Sure! Um, in Korea, we usually wait for the oldest person to start eating. Also, we should not put our chopsticks standing up in the rice bowl. It is, um, how to say... not good.
Right, we also, um, do not pour our own drink. We should pour for others and let them pour for us. And, we use both hands when giving or receiving something, especially from elders.
Oh, I see. In Korea, we also place the spoon and chopsticks neatly on the table when weâ€™re finished. And, um, we say "Thank you for the meal" to show appreciation.
Yes, um, in Korea, we often eat communal dishes, so we use, um, common spoons and chopsticks to serve food. This is, how to say... more hygienic and respectful.
Yes, I agree. It is, um, make the meal more enjoyable and friendly. By the way, maybe we can try Korean dining etiquette together sometime?
Yes, that sounds great! I will bring some Korean dishes.
Thank you, too. It was nice talking to you. Have a good day!
