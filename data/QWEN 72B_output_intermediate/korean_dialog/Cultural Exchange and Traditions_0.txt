Hi, I am good. Um, just studying for exam. You?
Oh, yes! There is one I really like. It is called Seollal. It is Korean New Year.
Sure. Seollal is in January or February. It depend on lunar calendar. We have big family gathering, you know.
Um, we do many thing. First, we perform ancestral ritual. It is, how to say... pay respect to our ancestors.
We wear special clothes called hanbok. It is very colorful and pretty. And, we eat special food. One is tteokguk. It is soup with rice cake.
Yes, I very like tteokguk. It is, um, have a good meaning. Eat tteokguk, you become one year older.
We play traditional game like yutnori. It is, um, board game. And, we do some, how to say... fun thing, like singing and dancing.
Yes, we play it. Everyone join. It very good time.
Um, we do, how to say... gift giving. We give money to children. It is called seo money.
Yes, sebae money. Children bow to elder and receive money.
Yes, sometimes. But, I try to do some thing same. Like wear hanbok and eat tteokguk.
Um, yes. I would like that. We can, um, try some Korean food and maybe wear hanbok.
That sound good. I look forward to it.
You welcome. I glad you like it. See you next weekend!
