Hi! I am good, thank you. Um, let me think... Ah, yes! Last weekend, I go to Han River with my friend Jisoo. We have very nice time.
We eat chicken and ride bike. Weather is so good, very warm but not too hot. We talk and laugh a lot.
Yes, we also take many pictures. I post some on Instagram. My friends like it. They say they want to go too.
I feel very happy and relaxed. It is good to spend time with friend. We talk about many things, and I forget about stress from school and work.
Yes, we plan to go again next weekend. Maybe we try different place in Han River.
Um, how to say... there is park with big grass area. We can have picnic there. I think it is called Seonyudo Park.
Thank you! I sure will. It is always nice to have someone to share good time with.
You welcome! It is my pleasure. Talk to you later, okay?
Bye! Have a good day!
