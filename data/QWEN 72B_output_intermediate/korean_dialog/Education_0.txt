Ah, hi! Um, I am little nervous. Exam is... um... how to say... important.
Yes, I start yesterday. I read textbook and make note. But, um... I have trouble with some part.
Um... the, the... chapter about... um... chemical reactions. It is hard for me.
Yes, please. That would be very help. When we can meet?
3 p.m. is good. Where we meet?
Um, library is okay. But, um... how to say... little far from my house. Can we meet at caf√© near school?
Bean and Leaf? I know place. Yes, that is good.
Yes, thank you. I will bring my textbook and note. See you tomorrow!
Thank you! Good luck to you too. Bye!
