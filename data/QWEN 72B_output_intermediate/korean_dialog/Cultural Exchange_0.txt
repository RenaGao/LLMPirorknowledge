Hi! Sure, um... I want tell about... how to say... Chuseok. It is Korean thanksgiving.
It is... um, August... no, September. Usually, it on 15th of August by lunar calendar.
People go to hometown and visit family. We make special food, like songpyeon. It is... um, small, rice cake. And we give gift to family and friend.
Sure! Songpyeon, it is, um, sweet rice cake. We fill it with, um, honey or bean paste. And we cook it on steamer. It is very tasty.
Yes, we also visit grave of ancestor. We clean grave and give offering. It is important to remember our ancestors.
Um, yes, people play... how to say... tug of war. And we also play traditional music and dance.
