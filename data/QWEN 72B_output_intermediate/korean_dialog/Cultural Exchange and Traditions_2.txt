Hi, I'm good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, um... I want to have festival, like... like Korean food and music.
I think we can have... um... bibimbap, kimchi, and... and maybe some makgeolli.
Yes, that right. It is very popular. And also, we can have Korean bbq.
For music, we can have... um, traditional Korean instrument, like gayageum and... and drum.
Yes, we can have... um... traditional game, like yutnori, and also, people can try on hanbok, Korean traditional dress.
We can use... um... colorful paper lanterns and... and traditional fans.
I think we can do it... um... in the park, like... like on a sunny day, maybe next month.
Yes, that would be very helpful. Can you help with... um... setting up and preparing food?
Thank you so much! I can't wait.
Yes, see you! Thank you!
