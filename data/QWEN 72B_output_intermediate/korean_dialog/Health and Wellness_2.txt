Hi, Alex! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, I want to start. I... um, I want to get healthier and lose some weight.
I like... um, how to say... running and maybe swimming.
Um, I can do three time... three times a week, maybe?
I think I can do... um, one hour each time.
Um, I am not sure about strength training. I think it is good, but I am not familiar.
Okay, I can try. How many times I do each exercise?
I see. And for swimming, how long I should swim?
Sounds good. I will try my best.
Yes, I want to eat more vegetables and less sugary food. Um, I think I can do this.
Thank you, Alex. I am excited to start.
Thank you! You too. Bye!
