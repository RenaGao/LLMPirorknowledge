Ah, hello. Yes, thank you. My internet is... um, very slow. It usually fast, but now it is very slow.
Um, yesterday. I try to do video call, but it keep... um, dis-connecting.
Um, I check my phone and my laptop. Both are slow. Maybe... um, all devices?
Yes, I restart it. But it not help.
Um, how to do speed test?
Okay, I will do. *pauses* It say my speed is 10 Mbps. That is... um, low?
Sure, my zip code is 12345.
Okay, what next?
Um, I find it. I press it now. *pauses* It is rebooting.
Okay, I will do. *pauses* It say my speed is 50 Mbps now. That is much better!
Thank you so much. I feel much better now.
Goodbye! Thank you!
