Hi, Minji! Um, I good. Thanks for asking. How about you?
Oh, favorite meal... um, I like Korean food. You know, bulgogi. It is... beef with sweet and spicy sauce.
Um, first, I buy... how to say... thin slice of beef. And also, I need... um, vegetables. Onion, garlic, and a little bit of carrot.
For sauce, I use soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil. And... um, pepper and ginger. Mix them together.
Yes, I marinate beef for, um, one hour. It make beef more tasty.
After marinate, I cook beef in pan. I put little oil, then add beef and vegetables. Stir them together.
Yes, always serve with rice. And sometimes, um, kimchi on side.
Um, yes! It will be fun. I cook, and you help me.
Let’s say, um, five o’clock. Is that okay?
See you then. Thank you!
