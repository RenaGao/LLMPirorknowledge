Yes, of course! What you need help with?
Ah, yes. The Grand Hotel is not far from here. Um, how to say... go straight this road, then turn right at first corner.
After you turn right, you walk about three blocks. Then, um, look for big building on left side. It is red and white, you cannot miss it.
Yes, it is tall. It is the tallest building on that street.
Yes, it is very safe. You can walk there without worry. But, um, it is good idea to be careful with your belongings, like always.
Yes, there is small park on your left side after you turn right. You can see it, and it is good place to rest if you need.
You are welcome! I hope you enjoy your stay at Grand Hotel. If you need more help, please come back and ask me.
You too! Goodbye!
