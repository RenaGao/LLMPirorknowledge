Hi! I am good, thank you. How you are?
Um... my goal is... I want to improve my English, and also, I want to travel... more places.
Because, um... I think it is very important for my job. And also, I want to read more books and watch movies without subtitle.
I am taking English class... um, online class. And I try to practice with... how to say... language partner.
I meet... um, once week. We talk about... um, different topics. It is very helpful.
Yes, I want to go to Japan and... um, maybe Thailand. I like to explore new culture and try new food.
I want to go... um, during summer. When the weather is nice.
I am researching... um, places to stay and things to do. I think I will book my ticket soon.
Thank you! I will. Um... how to say... it is nice talking with you.
You too! Bye!
