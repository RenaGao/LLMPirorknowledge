Hi! I am good, thank you. Um, no plans yet. Why you ask?
Oh, that sounds fun! Um, any idea where we can go?
Busan? I heard it is nice. When we can go?
Two day trip? Yes, I think that good. What we do there?
Um, shopping and beach... I like. And... how to say... seafood is good too.
Yes, I can ask Minji and Seung. They also like beach and food. I will send them message.
Train, I think. It is easy and... um, cheap. And we not worry about parking.
Yes, we check together. And um, when we meet to start our trip?
Nine a.m.? Yes, that is good. I will tell Minji and Seung.
Okay, I will send message now. Um, see you later!
You too! Bye!
