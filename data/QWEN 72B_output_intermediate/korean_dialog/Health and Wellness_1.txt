Hi, I am doing good, thank you. And you?
Yes, I want to be more... more healthy. You know, eat good food and do exercise.
Oh, I see. Um, how much... how much fruits and vegetables?
Okay, I will try. And exercise, what kind of exercise you recommend?
Jogging sounds good. I like to run. And maybe... um, how to say... yoga?
Perfect. I will start with jogging and yoga. Um, how often I need to exercise?
Okay, I will do it. Also, I want to drink more water. Is that good?
Eight glasses, got it. And, um, I will try to go to bed early. I hear sleep is important too.
Good to know. Thank you so much for advice.
I think they will. Thank you again. Um, I will talk to you later.
Bye!
