Hi! Thank you for inviting me. Um, I start reading about it, but it is... um, very hard to understand. I have many question.
Um, I think... it is about particle can be in two place at same time?
Oh, so it is like... um, how to say... it is not decided until we see it?
Yes, I read about. It is when particle connect, even if far apart?
I see. So, if I change one, other one change too?
Yes, it is more clear now. Thank you for explaining. I will study more to understand better.
Sure. I will send you message if I have question. Thank you very much.
Thank you. See you next time! Bye!
