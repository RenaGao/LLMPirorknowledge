Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?
Um, not really. I usually read Korean books, but I want to try something new. Do you have any recommendation?
Oh, I heard about it. Why you recommend this book?
That sounds interesting. I like book about... um, how to say... society and people.
I see. Can I ask, is it easy to understand? I am not very good at reading English literature.
Okay, that sounds good. I will try to read it. Thank you for recommendation.
Yes, I will. Um, do you have other books you can recommend for practice?
Oh, I heard about that one too. Maybe I will try that one next. Thank you so much!
Thank you, I hope so too. Take care, and see you later!
