Ah, hello! Everything is good. I have a little problem with one topic in our class. Can you help me?
It is... um, how to say... photosynthesis? I not understand it very well.
Yes, but I not sure about... um, how the light... light thing... light energy is used.
Ah, I see. So, the water molecules... they... break?
Glucose? That is the sugar, right?
Uh-huh. So, the light energy help to make... um, sugar and oxygen?
I think I understand now. Can you... um, give me an example of how this works in real life?
Ah, I get it now. The tree makes its own food and gives us oxygen. That is very cool.
No, I think I good now. Thank you so much for helping me.
Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
