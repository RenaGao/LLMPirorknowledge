Good afternoon. Um, thank you for having me. My name is Jisoo. I am from Seoul, Korea. I studied computer science in university for four years. I like coding and um, creating new things.
Um, I always interested in technology. When I was in high school, I start to learn programming. I found it very interesting and challenging. I want to make something that can help people in their daily life.
Yes, in my last internship, I worked on a project to develop a mobile app for booking restaurant reservations. Um, how to say... it was a team project, and I was responsible for the back-end development.
I used Python for the main programming and SQLite for the database. We also used some API to get information about restaurants.
Well, um, the biggest challenge was to make sure the app runs smoothly and quickly. We had to optimize the code and the database queries. I also worked with the front-end team to ensure all the data was displayed correctly.
Um, in my university, I was part of a group project to develop a website for a local charity. We had to communicate and coordinate with each other to complete different parts of the project. It was, um, challenging but very rewarding.
I read a lot of tech blogs and articles. I also attend online webinars and sometimes take online courses to learn new programming languages and tools.
Um, when I was working on a project to develop a web application, we encountered an issue with the server. It was slow and sometimes crashed. I had to debug the code and optimize the server configuration. It took some time, but we finally fixed it.
No, I think I covered everything. Um, can you tell me more about the team and the work environment?
That sounds great. Thank you for the information.
Thank you very much. I look forward to hearing from you. Goodbye!
