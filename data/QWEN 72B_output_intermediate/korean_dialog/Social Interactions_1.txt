Oh, hi! No, nothing special. You?
Yes, I think good idea. She will be very happy. What we can do?
Um, sounds good. But, how to say... do you think she like that?
How about... um, pizza and some Korean food? Maybe bulgogi or japchae?
How about... um, 7 o'clock? So we have time to prepare everything.
Yes, a few more. But not too many. Maybe 5 or 6?
We can use balloons and maybe some streamers. And, um, how to say... confetti?
Yes, I can bring some board games. We can play Uno or Monopoly.
How about... um, a book or a nice notebook? She likes reading and writing.
How about... um, tomorrow afternoon? After class?
You welcome. I am happy to help. See you tomorrow!
