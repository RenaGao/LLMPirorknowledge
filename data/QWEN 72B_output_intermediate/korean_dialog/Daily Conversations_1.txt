Hi, um... I am fine. Thanks. You?
Um, not really. I... think I am free. Why?
Oh, that sounds nice. Park is good. Um, how about we go to Han River? I hear the weather is really nice now.
We can... um, eat something and maybe ride bicycles. How to say... bike ride?
I think there is a place near the park. Hmm, how to say... bike rental shop?
Um, how about eleven o'clock? Eleven...
We can meet at the park entrance. You know, um, the big sign?
Yes, see you then! Thanks for asking me.
You too! Bye!
