Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, yes, I think we need to divide work. Can we... how to say... separate tasks?
I can do, um, data collection and some, how to say... data analysis. I am good at that.
How about we start tomorrow? We need to finish by this Friday, right?
Yes, 10 a.m. is fine. Um, should we also, how to say... check progress every day?
Yes, 3 p.m. is good. We can, um, send updates and discuss any problems.
Yes, Thursday afternoon. We can finalize everything then.
I think that is all. We have clear plan, so we should be good.
Yes, I am excited. Thank you for working with me.
See you then. Goodbye!
