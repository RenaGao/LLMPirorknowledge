Hi! Iâ€™m good, thank you. How are you?
Oh, that sounds nice! Jisoo will be happy. When we do it?
Um, Saturday... that good. Where we have the party?
Yes, that sounds good. What time we start?
7 PM, okay. Um... what we need to do? Food, decorations, and...?
Ah, yes, card. I can make one. And who we invite?
Yes, that good. I can help with the invitations. What we tell Jisoo?
Yes, that smart. Um, what about music?
Yes, playlist, that good. I will help with that too.
Yes, Friday... how about 5 PM?
See you then. Thanks for planning this! Jisoo will be so happy.
You too! Bye!
