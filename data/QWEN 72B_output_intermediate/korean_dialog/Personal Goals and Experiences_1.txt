Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um... I want to learn cooking. How to say... cook more variety of food. It is important for me because I like to eat different kinds of food.
I like... um, Italian food and Korean food. I want to make... how to say... pasta and bibimbap.
Yes, I try make pasta, but not very good. Bibimbap is... um, I can make little bit, but not perfect.
Yes, I want to start with spaghetti carbonara. It look easy, but good taste.
I will watch video on YouTube and read cookbooks. Maybe... how to say... take cooking class?
Yes, I want to... um, make food for my family and friends. It is... how to say... bond with them.
Yes, I want to... how to say... cook dinner for my family every week. And also, I want to make one new dish every month.
Yes, I like hiking and photography. Hiking is good for health, and photography... um, it is fun to capture beautiful moments.
Yes, thank you for listening. I will work hard to achieve my goals. Goodbye!
