Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Ah, yes. Um, in Korea, we have many rules for eating. For example, we wait until oldest person start eating.
Yes, we use chopsticks and spoon. But we not put them together on table. It is, how to say... bad luck.
Um, when pour drink, we use two hand. And we not pour own drink. We pour for other and they pour for you.
Yes, we sit oldest person at head of table. And we not put feet on chair or table. It is not polite.
Oh, I know. We also use fork in Korea, but not as much as spoon and chopsticks.
Ah, yes. In Korea, we also think it is not good. But we more relaxed about it in family.
In Korea, we try to finish all food on plate. It show respect for food and person who cook.
Yes, I agree. It is good to learn and respect other cultureâ€™s customs.
You are welcome! I happy to talk about it. See you next time!
