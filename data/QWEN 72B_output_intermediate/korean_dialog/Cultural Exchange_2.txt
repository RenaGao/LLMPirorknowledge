Hi, I am good. Thank you. How you are?
Oh, my favorite holiday... that is Seollal. Seollal is Korean New Year. It is very important holiday.
Sure. Um... Seollal, we go to our family house. We wear traditional clothes, hanbok. We do many things, like praying for ancestors and playing games.
Yes, we eat tteokguk. Tteokguk is rice cake soup. It is very tasty. And also, we have jeon, which is like pancake.
Yes, we give money called sebaetdon to children. It is tradition. Children say special blessing words to get money.
We usually have big family gathering. We cook together, eat, and talk. It is very warm and nice time.
