Hello. I want to return this thing... um, this product. It is... uh, not working properly.
Um, it not turn on. I plug it in, but nothing happen.
Yes, sure. Here is the receipt. It from last week.
Good. But, um... I want to ask, can I get money back or... how to say... exchange for different product?
I think exchange. I want different model, better one.
Um, I see... how to say... in the store, there is better one. Can you show me?
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Yes, I think this one looks good. How much is it?
Okay, that is fine. I want this one.
Thank you very much. It is very helpful.
