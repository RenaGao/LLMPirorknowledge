Hi! I am good, thank you. How you are?
Oh, yes. We plan to go to Han River, right?
Oh, no problem. It happen. What time you have commitment?
I see. How about afternoon? We can meet later?
3 p.m. is fine. We can still go to Han River, yes?
Yes, I like that plan. We can rent bikes from park, right?
Right, I will bring my ID. Is there anything else we need?
Good idea. I will bring. I am looking forward to it.
No problem. It is okay. I see you on Saturday at 3 p.m.!
You too! Bye-bye!
