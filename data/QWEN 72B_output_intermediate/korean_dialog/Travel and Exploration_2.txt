Yes, of course. What do you need help with?
Sure! Han River Park is... um, it is not far from here. You can take... how to say... the bus or the subway.
You can take the subway. Take line 2 and get off at... um, Hangangjin Station. It is... it is easy to find.
When you get off, you need to go to exit 4. Then, you walk straight for about... ah, 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, you will see... um, the park entrance on your right side. It is... it is very big and you cannot miss it.
Um, you should... you should check the weather before you go. It is... it is very nice these days, but it can change quickly.
Youâ€™re welcome! If you need more help, um, you can ask me. I am... I am happy to help.
Thank you! You too. Bye-bye!
