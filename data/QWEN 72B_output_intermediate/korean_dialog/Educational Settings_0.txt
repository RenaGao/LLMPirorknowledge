Hi, um, I am good. Thank you. And you?
Yes, um, I have question about... how to say... the essay we need to write.
Well, the prompt says we need to write about the impact of technology on society. But, um, I am not sure how to start.
Um, I think about... how technology make life easier, and also, um, the problem with privacy.
Oh, I see. So, I write introduction first, and then, um, one paragraph for each point?
Yes, that make sense. I also have question about the word count. How many words we need to write?
Okay, 1,500 words. And um, do we need to use outside sources?
Ah, I understand. Thank you so much for help. I feel much better now.
Thank you, really. I will try my best. Have a good day!
