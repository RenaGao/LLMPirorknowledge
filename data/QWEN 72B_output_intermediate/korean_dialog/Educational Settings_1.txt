Hey, I am good. Um, yes, I start little bit. How about you?
Not really. I think I need more practice. What do you usually do when you study?
That sound good. I try to read the textbook, but sometimes it hard to understand. Any other tips?
Oh, yes. Practice problems. I forget about that. Where can I find them?
Good idea. I will check those out. Do you want to study together sometime this week?
Um, I am free on Wednesday afternoon. How about three o’clock?
Let’s meet at the library. It is quiet and good for studying.
Great. Thank you for your help. See you on Wednesday!
You too. Bye!
