Hello, Dr. Smith. I am Minji. Nice to meet you. I not feel good today.
Um, I have... uh... head... headache. And I have fever, I think.
I have it for three day. And my body is... um... how to say... very achy.
Yes, I have little cough. But no sore throat. I just feel... um... tired all time.
Um, I not sleep good. And I not eat much. I have no appetite.
I take aspirin for headache. But it not help much.
Okay, thank you, Dr. Smith. I hope I feel better soon.
No, I think thatâ€™s all. Thank you for your help.
Thank you. Goodbye, Dr. Smith.
