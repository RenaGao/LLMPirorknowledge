Hello. Um, I want to buy... um, gift for my friend. Can you help me?
Um, how to say... I think something nice for their home. My friend love to cook and eat.
Oh, knives sound good. But, um, I not sure which one is best. Can you show me?
They look very nice. Um, how much is this set?
Oh, that is bit expensive. Do you have any cheaper option?
This one look good too. Um, can I hold it?
It feels very good. I think my friend will like it. I will take this one.
No, I think that is all. Thank you so much for help.
Thank you. You too. Goodbye!
