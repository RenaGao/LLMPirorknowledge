**Scene: A project deadline discussion between a native English speaker (NS) and a Thai speaker (L2, Thai).**
Good morning! I am good, thank you. How to say... um, how are you?
Um, I think I almost finish. But some part still need more time.
The part for... um, how to say... data entry and the report, they are not complete yet.
I need, um, maybe two or three days more. Is it okay?
Um, I try my best. I think it is possible, but I need work extra hours.
Yes, it is very good. I can finish on Monday for sure.
Yes, I will finish it. No problem.
Um, I think I am okay. But if I have problem, I will, how to say... ask for help?
Yes, I will send update. No problem.
No, I think this is all. Thank you very much for understanding.
You too! Goodbye, and see you on Monday.
