Hi, I am good. Thank you. How are you?
Sure, um... one of the most famous festival in Thailand is Songkran. It is Thai New Year.
It happen in April. Usually, um, 13th to 15th of April.
People celebrate by, um, throwing water at each other. It is fun. We also, um, clean house and, uh, visit temple.
Water is for, um, washing away bad thing from last year. It is like, um, fresh start.
Yes, we eat, um, special food like, um, mango sticky rice. And, uh, we have parade and, um, music.
Yes, um, I remember one time, my family and I go to, um, um, Chiang Mai. It is very, very fun. Everyone join in, um, water fight.
Um, yes. Songkran is, uh, important for family and, um, community to come together. It is, um, very special time.
You are welcome. I happy to tell you about Songkran.
Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
