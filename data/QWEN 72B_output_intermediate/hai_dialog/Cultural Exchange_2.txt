Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Sure! My favorite holiday is Songkran. It is Thai New Year, celebrate in April.
People go to temple, pour water on Buddha statue for good luck. Also, we have big water fight in street. Is very fun!
Yes, we go to my grandparent's house. We pay respect to them, and they give us blessing. We also cook traditional food together.
We cook Kanom Jeen, it is noodle with green curry. And also, we make Mango Sticky Rice. It is very delicious!
We cook sticky rice, mix it with coconut milk and sugar. Then, we put fresh mango on top. It is sweet and cool, perfect for Songkran.
Yes, we have Songkran festival in many cities. Even in other countries, people celebrate. But it is not same as in Thailand, of course.
Maybe we will have small party at home. We invite some friends, and we can have water fight in backyard.
You are welcome! I happy to share. Maybe next year, you come to Thailand for Songkran?
Bye! See you!
