Hi! I am good, thank you. Teacher, I have question about homework.
Um, the math homework. I not understand this problem, number five.
It is about... um, finding the area of a triangle. But I not sure how to start.
Yes, base is 10 cm and height is 8 cm.
Ah, I see. So, 10 times 8 is 80, and then 80 divided by 2 is 40.
Yes, I think I understand now. But, one more thing. How to know when use this formula?
Ah, okay. Thank you, Teacher. I will practice more.
I will. Thank you very much, Teacher. Goodbye.
