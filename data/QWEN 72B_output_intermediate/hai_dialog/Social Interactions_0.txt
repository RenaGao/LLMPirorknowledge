Hello! My name is Nuch. Nice to meet you.
I from Bangkok, Thailand. It is very... how to say... lively city.
My friend, Lek, invite me. He say it is good party.
Not many. I usually... um, stay at home. But I like to meet new people.
I like to read book, watch movie, and cook. Cooking is fun, you know.
My favorite is... um, green curry. It is very... how to say... spicy and delicious.
Yes, I try pizza and hamburger. They are good, but not like Thai food.
I like to draw and paint. I think it is very creative and relaxing.
Yes, I have one painting of... um, sunset on the beach. It is very... how to say... peaceful.
Sure! I will bring some pictures next time we meet.
Thank you, Emily. You too. See you later!
