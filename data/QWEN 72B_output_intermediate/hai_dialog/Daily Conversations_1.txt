Hi! I am free, yes. What do you want to do?
Oh, that sound good! The weather is nice now. We can go early morning, no hot.
Um... 8:30, is it okay?
Yes, I bring some snacks. We can eat there, no?
I like to bring... um, how you say... sticky rice and mango. It is delicious, yes?
You will like it, I think. It is very Thai food.
Yes, at the entrance. I will be there early.
Thank you! You too. See you Saturday morning!
Bye!
