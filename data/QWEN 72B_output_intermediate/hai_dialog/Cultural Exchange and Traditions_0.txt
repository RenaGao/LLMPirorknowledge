Hi Alex, I am good, thank you. And you?
I am good too. Thank you.
Sure, I love Loy Krathong. It is... um, how to say... very beautiful festival. We celebrate it every year in November.
People make krathongs, which is a... um... small basket made from banana leaves. We put flower, candle, and incense in it.
Most people make them by hand, but you can buy them too. After, we go to river or lake and float krathongs.
We float krathongs to pay respect to the water spirits and to ask for forgiveness. Also, it is way to get rid of bad luck.
Yes, I have. My family and I make krathongs together. It is fun and happy time.
Yes, we eat many traditional Thai foods. For example, tom yum soup and mango sticky rice. And we also have sweets like kanom krok.
Yes, there are often fireworks and light shows. It is very pretty and everyone feels happy.
No problem! Thank you for asking. We enjoy telling about our culture.
Yes, thank you. Talk to you soon!
