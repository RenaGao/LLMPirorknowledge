Hello, thank you. My name is Nuch. Um, I have problem with my recent purchase.
Sure. I buy new... uh, blender from your store last week. But when I use it, um, it not work properly.
Yes. When I turn it on, it make strange noise. And, um, sometimes it stop working.
I notice it, um, two days after I buy it. It work fine at first, but then, uh, problem start.
Yes, I have it. It is... um, 12345678.
It is... uh, how to say... it is Model B1200.
Um, I think replacement is better. Because I need it soon.
No, that is all. Thank you so much for your help.
Yes, thank you. Have a good day, too.
