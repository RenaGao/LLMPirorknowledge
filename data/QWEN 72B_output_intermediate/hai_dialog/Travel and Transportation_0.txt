Oh, hi! Yes, Chiang Mai is very beautiful. Um, how to say... really nice place. I go there last week with my family.
We visit many temple. Um, and also go to night market. It is very fun. Many thing to buy and eat.
Yes, I try many food. Um, like... how to say... Khao Soi. It is noodle with curry. Very delicious. And also, um, mango sticky rice. Very sweet.
Yes, I take many photo. I show you later, okay?
My favorite part is visit Wat Phra That Doi Suthep. It is very big temple on the mountain. The view is amazing. You can see all Chiang Mai city.
Yes, it is busy, but not too much. We go early in the morning, so it is nice and not hot yet.
Yes, we also go to a elephant camp. It is very interesting to see elephant and learn about them.
Yes, we can feed them and touch them. It is very gentle. They are big, but not scary.
We stay for four day. It is not long, but we do many thing.
Yes, I want to go back. There are many place I want to see. Maybe next year.
Thank you! I will tell you more when I go back. See you soon!
