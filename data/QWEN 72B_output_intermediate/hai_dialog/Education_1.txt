Hi, I am good. Thank you. You how are?
Yes, I am ready. Um... the topic is about... um, how to say... conservation of energy. I think it is very tricky.
Sure. I know... um, energy cannot create or destroy, only change form. But, how to apply in problem, I not sure.
Yes, I follow. Potential become kinetic. But, how to calculate, still confuse.
Yes, I know. But, when I do problem, I not sure which one use.
Um, so PE... mgh... 2 kg times 9.8 times 5... that is 98 joules.
Yes, I think... KE... ½mv²... 2 kg times... um, square of... 9.8 times square root of 10... is... 98 joules.
Yes, I understand. Potential become kinetic, total energy same.
No, I think I get it now. Thank you for explaining.
Yes, that would be good. Thank you very much.
You too. Bye-bye.
