Hello. Um, I have problem with my... my... internet. It not work.
It start yesterday. I try to use internet, but it not connect. I check everything, but it still not work.
Yes, I try. I unplug it, wait for ten minute, and plug it back. But still, no connection.

Of course. I live at 123/45 Sukhumvit Soi 13, Bangkok.
Oh, I see. How long it take to fix?
Okay, thank you. What I can do in meantime?
No, that is all. Thank you very much for your help.
Thank you, you too. Bye-bye.
