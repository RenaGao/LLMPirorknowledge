Hi! I am good. How are you, um, how to say... today?
Oh, that sound nice. I like picnic. When you want to go?
Saturday, that good. Where you want to go?
No, I no know. But, um, how to say... I can look it up. Itâ€™s okay?
How about, um, ten o'clock? That okay?
Yes, I will bring some Thai food. Um, like... sandwiches and fruit. What you bring?
Yes, I like chips and, um, chocolate. How to say... chocolate cookies?
Yes, I think we can bring, um, Frisbee and, how to say... board games?
No, I no have. But we can borrow from, um, the store near my house.
Yes, that good. I think we will have fun.
Yes, that right. I will, um, tell my family too.
See you Saturday! Bye!
