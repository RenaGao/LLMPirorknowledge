Yes, of course! What you need?
Ah, Royal Garden Hotel. It is not far. Um, how to say... You go straight this road, and then you turn right at third street.
Not really. It is only... maybe five minute walk. You will see big sign say "Royal Garden Hotel."
Yes, you pass small market. It is red building. After market, you turn right, and hotel is on left side.
You welcome. Um, do you need anything else?
Yes, it is safe. There are many street lights and people walk there even late.
No problem. I hope you enjoy your stay. If you need help again, just ask someone. They are friendly here.
You too. Goodbye!
