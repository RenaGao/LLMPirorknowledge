Hi! I am fine, thank you. How are you?
Yes. Um, we should talk about... um, how to say... project update, yes?
Maybe, um, team goals for next month. And also, um, any problem we have, we can discuss it.
I think, um, Thursday morning is good. Not too early, maybe 10 o'clock?
In the conference room? It is big enough for everyone.
Yes, that is a good idea. I can, um, write the email if you want.
Sure. I will write it and send it to everyone. Is there anything else we need to do?
You are welcome. I will, um, make sure everything is ready. See you Thursday!
Bye!
