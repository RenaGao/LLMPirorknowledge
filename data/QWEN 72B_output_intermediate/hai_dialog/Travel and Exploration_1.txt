Hi! I am good. Thank you. And you?
Oh, my favorite place is Chiang Mai. Um, it very beautiful and relaxing. How to say... many temples and nice nature.
I like visit temple, especially Wat Phra That Doi Suthep. It very old and have beautiful view. Also, I like walk in night market. So many food and thing to buy.
My favorite is khao soi. It is noodle soup with coconut milk. Very delicious. And also, sticky rice with mango. It sweet and fresh.
Yes, I try elephant riding and trekking. It fun, but also, um, how to say... very tiring. Elephant very big and move slow. But, I like it because see nature close.
People very friendly and kind. They always smile and help visitor. I feel like home.
Yes, one time I go with my family to Doi Inthanon. We hike and see waterfall. It very beautiful and we take many picture. It special because we all together.
I think because it mix of old and new. You can see traditional temple and modern thing. Also, weather is nice, not too hot. People very friendly and food very good. I always want go back.
You welcome! I happy to talk about Chiang Mai. Maybe you can visit sometime!
Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
