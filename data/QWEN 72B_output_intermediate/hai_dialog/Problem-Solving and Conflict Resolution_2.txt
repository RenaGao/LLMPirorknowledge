Hi Alex, I fine. What we talk about today?
Yes, I agree. Um... we have problem with communication and tracking progress.
That good idea. Maybe we can use... how to say... software for project management?
I know Trello. It is easy to use. We can try it.
Yes, clear goals are important. And, um, how to say... follow-up with each other?
Good. And we should, um, review our progress at the end of each month.
Yes, that sounds good. We can start this week, yes?
You welcome, Alex. I look forward to work with you.
Thank you. Bye, Alex!
