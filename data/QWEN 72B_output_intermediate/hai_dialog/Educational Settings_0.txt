Hello, I am good, thank you. How to say... I have question about homework.
I not understand, um, the essay question. It say, "Discuss the impact of social media on communication." I not know what they mean by "impact."
Oh, I see. So, I need to write about good and bad things of social media on communication?
Yes, understand. And how many words should I write?
Okay, I will do that. And, um, should I use books or internet for research?
Right, I will check. And, how to write introduction?
I see. I will start with statistic. Did you know, 3.8 billion people use social media? This is more than half of world population.
Yes, thank you. I feel more confident now.
Okay, I will. Thank you very much for helping me.
Thank you, see you!
