Hi, I am Nuch. Nice to meet you, Alex. How are you?
I am good, thank you. Um, how to say... What do you like to do in your free time?
I... I like to go to the park and... um... play with my dog. And I like to cook traditional Thai food.
My favorite is Pad Thai. It is... um... how to say... very tasty. And I like to make green curry too.
Yes, I like to... um... draw. I draw pictures of... um... nature and animals.
Um, not yet. But I want to try sometime. How about you? Do you have any other hobbies besides hiking and reading?
No, I have not. But I think it is... um... interesting. I want to learn how to take good pictures.
Yes, that would be... um... very nice. When can we do that?
That sounds good. I am free... um... on Saturday.
10 a.m. is... um... good. I will be there.
Yes, me too. Thank you, Alex. See you Saturday.
