Hi, itâ€™s good. Thank you. How about you?
Um, yes, I can. Old town square, it is... how to say... very famous place here.
You can start from the bus station. It is near here.
You go straight, and then turn left at the big tree. Big tree, you will see.
After big tree, you go straight again. You will see the market. Then, you turn right at the market.
Yes, that right. You will see the old town square after market. It is very beautiful.
It is not far. Maybe, um, 15 minute walk.
No, not really. Just follow the direction I tell. You will find it easy.
You welcome. I hope you enjoy old town square. It is very nice place.
See you! Have good day!
