Hi! Yes, I free. What do you need to explain?
Okay, I see. Then, what I need to do after that?
Ah, I understand. How to add team member?
Got it. And then, we need to assign task?
Okay, I think I understand. How we make sure everyone know their task?
Ah, that make sense. And, um, how to do the check-in?
Yes, I see. I will try to follow this step. Is there anything else I need to know?
Thank you! I really appreciate it. I think I can manage it now.
Yes, that very good. Thank you again.
You too! Goodbye!
