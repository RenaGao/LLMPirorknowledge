Hi, um, I am good. Thank you. And you?
Yes, I am better now. But, um, still a little... how to say... tired?
Yes, I try. I drink water a lot and, um, I eat... what is it... healthy food.
I try to sleep more, but sometimes it is hard. I have much work.
Okay, I will try. And, um, what about exercise? I think I need to start doing more.
Yes, I want to go jogging. But, um, I donâ€™t know where to start.
That sound good. Um, how to say... a little scared about going alone.
Yes, maybe I ask Lek to go with me. He like exercise.
And, um, I think I need to, how to say... relax more.
Yes, I heard about it. I will, um, try yoga. Thank you for advice.
Yes, that would be nice. Um, what time you want to meet?
Okay, I can do that. See you Saturday morning!
Thank you. Take care! Bye!
