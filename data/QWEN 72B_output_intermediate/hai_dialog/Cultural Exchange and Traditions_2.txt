Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, yes, I want to organize a Thai food festival. We can share our traditional food and culture with everyone.
We can have pad thai, green curry, and som tum. Also, we can have dessert like mango sticky rice. People love it.
Yes, we can have Thai dance performance. And also, we can teach people how to make some simple Thai dishes.
Um, how to say... yes, we can have games like tuk tuk. It is fun and easy to play.
It is a game where we use a small ball and try to hit it with a stick. The one who hits it farthest win.
We can have it at the community center next month. Maybe on a Saturday?
Yes, that would be very nice. Thank you!
That is good. Next Wednesday, is it okay?
Letâ€™s say 2:00 p.m.?
Thank you! See you Wednesday. Bye!
