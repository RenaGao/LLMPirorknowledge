Hi! I good, thank you. How about you?
Um, yeah. I think we can go to park, like Chatuchak. We can have picnic there.
Oh, we can use... um, colorful balloons and banners. And we can bring snacks and drinks for picnic.
Yes, I can do that. I will buy some snacks and drinks. And maybe some small gift for Nuch.
Sure, I write message in Thai. It will be nice surprise for her.
Um, how about Friday after work? We can meet at 6 p.m.
Letâ€™s meet at the entrance of Chatuchak Park. It easy to find.
Yes, of course. We keep it secret until we surprise her.
I think we cover everything. We just need to make sure everyone is on time.
No problem. I excited for the surprise.
See you then! Bye!
