Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, yes. I... finish my exam for English. It is very important for me.
I study every day. I read book, um... how to say... book for practice test. I also listen to English podcast.
I am very happy! My teacher tell me I pass with good score. I feel very... how to say... proud.
It mean I can speak English better now. I can apply for job in big company. Also, I can travel and talk with people from other country.
Um, next, I want to improve my speaking more. I want to practice more and maybe take another exam.
I will join English club. And also, I will talk with my friend who speak English. Maybe we can practice together.
Not yet, but I will look for one soon. I think it will be very helpful.
Thank you. I am very excited to improve more.
Yes, I will talk to you soon. Goodbye!
