Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
My goal is to... um, lose some weight and get more fit. I want to feel healthy and strong.
I like to run and do some... um, yoga. But I also want to try new things. How to say... strength training?
I go to gym... um, two time per week. Sometimes I run in the park on Saturday.
Okay, I can try. What is interval training?
Ah, I see. That sounds challenging but good. Can we start with that next week?
How about... Tuesday and Thursday? And maybe Saturday?
Yes, that sound good to me. I will try my best.
Sure, I want to see my progress. Thank you so much for help.
See you Tuesday. Bye!
