Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, how to say... now is good. I have time now.
Yes, I start. I do some research and um... make plan.
Sure. I find many sources about the topic. And I make outline for the report. It is not finish, but I think it is good start.
Yes, I need to write introduction and background. Also, I have to collect data for the analysis.
I think... yes, I can. But, um, I have some question about the format. Can you help me?
I not sure how to organize the data. And the citation style, I am not familiar with it.
That is very helpful. Thank you so much.
No, I think that is all. I will work on it and send you update soon.
Yes, that is good. I will be ready.
Thank you! Goodbye, see you later.
