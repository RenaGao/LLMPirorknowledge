Hi! I am good, thank you. Yes, I think about trip with friends. We want go to new city, maybe somewhere not too far.
Um, I think about Chiang Mai. It is nice and have many things to see. Also, my friend Lek, she like Chiang Mai very much.
We want go next month, maybe in October. Weather is good, not too hot.
I want visit temples, like Wat Phra That Doi Suthep. And also, we can go to night market, eat street food. Lek, she love street food.
Um, we not decide yet. Maybe guesthouse near city center? It is easy for go everywhere.
Yes, we want keep it low. Maybe each person pay around 5000 baht for trip. It is enough, right?
Yes, I talk to them. Everyone excited. Lek, she say she will prepare some snack for trip.
Um, yes, maybe you can give advice for best places to visit in Chiang Mai?
Thank you so much! You help is very useful.
Thank you! See you soon. Bye!
