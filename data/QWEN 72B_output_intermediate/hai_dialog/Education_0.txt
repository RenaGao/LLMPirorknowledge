Oh, hi! I am fine, thank you. I have time. What do you want to talk about?
Yes, I start. But I have problem with some part. It is difficult.
Um, the... how to say... the section about... um, the ecosystem. It is very complex.
Yes, I do not understand how to... um... how to identify the primary producer in the food chain.
Plants, yes. I get it now. But how we know which plant is primary producer?
Ah, I see. It makes sense. Thank you. How about you? You understand everything in the ecosystem section?
That sounds great! When can we meet?
Saturday morning? Yes, that is good. What time?
Ten o'clock is fine. I will bring my notes and books.
See you Saturday! Thank you for helping me.
You too! Bye!
