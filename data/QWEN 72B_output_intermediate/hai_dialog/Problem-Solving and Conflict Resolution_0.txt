Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Oh, yes. I also want to talk about it. I think... um... communication, it not good.
Um, when we plan to go to Chatuchak Park, I think you not want to go. You say, "Maybe," but I feel you not happy.
Oh, I see. You have many work to do?
I understand. Next time, can you tell me if you not feel good?
No problem. I also sorry if I make you feel bad. We friends, we can talk about this.
Yes, that is good idea! I will bring some snacks and drinks.
Yes, 8:30 is good. I will be there.
Me too. Thank you. See you Saturday!
