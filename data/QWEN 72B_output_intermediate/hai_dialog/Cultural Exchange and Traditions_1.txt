Yes, spoon is main. Fork help to push food to spoon. But, in Western, fork is main.
In Thailand, we eat all dish together. Not separate course. We mix different flavor in one meal.
I like it, but sometimes, I miss mix all food together. It is fun to mix flavor.
In Thailand, we often pay together. If one person pay, it is very generous. But, usually, we share cost.
Yes, tipping, but not as much as Western. In some restaurant, we give small tip. But, it is not necessary always.
Yes, it is good. Thank you for talk about this. It is very interesting.
