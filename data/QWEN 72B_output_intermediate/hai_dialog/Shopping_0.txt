Oh, hello. Yes, I need help. I want to find... um, something to fix my wall.
Um, I think I need a... how to say... thing for hanging pictures?
Yes, that’s right! Picture hanging strips. Where can I find them?
Ok, thank you. How... how to say... how many do I need for big picture?
I see. And... um, do you have something to measure the wall?
Great. And... how to say... glue for small things, like decorations?
Oh, yes. Adhesive dots. That’s what I need. Thank you so much for your help.
I will. Thank you again. Goodbye!
