Hi! Um, my favorite meal... is green curry. It is very delicious. I like to prepare it, but it is a little... how to say... complicated.
I need chicken, coconut milk, green curry paste, vegetables like bamboo shoot and eggplant, Thai basil, and fish sauce.
Yes, I... um, first, I put coconut milk in pan and heat it. Then I add green curry paste and stir until is mix well.
Next, I add chicken and cook until is... um... not pink. Then I add vegetables and stir for a few minutes.
I usually cook them until they are soft, but not too soft. Maybe five minutes.
I add Thai basil at the end and fish sauce for taste. I stir for one more minute and then it is ready to eat.
Yes, um... I think you should... how to say... taste and adjust the seasoning. Sometimes need more fish sauce or sugar.
Sure! I would be happy to cook with you. It is fun, and you can learn.
Yes, I am free. What day is good for you?
Saturday afternoon is good. We can start around two oâ€™clock?
Great! I will help you when we cook.
See you Saturday at two! Bye!
