Oh, yes, of course! I like cameras. What kind you want? For photo or video?
Um, I think mirrorless camera good. It have many feature and not too heavy. You can try Sony or Canon.
Yes, battery life important. Sony have good battery, but Canon also good. Maybe check review online first?
Sony and Canon have many lens. You can find different type, like wide angle or telephoto. It depend what you like to shoot.
Price also important. Sony sometimes expensive, but Canon have good price. You can find good deal if you wait for sale.
Both brand have good interface. Maybe try both in store first? You can see which one feel better for you.
You welcome! I hope you find good camera. Um, if you have question, you can ask me again.
sounds good! I wait to hear from you. Bye!
