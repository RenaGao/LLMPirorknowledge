Yes, I am free. What is it about?
Yes, I am. The weather is good these days.
Eight thirty is good for me.
Yes, I will bring some food. You can bring drinks, okay?
Yes, that is correct.
Sure, I can help. What do we need to bring?
Yes, um... we should bring an umbrella, just in case. And maybe a small bag for shopping.
Yes, a map is good. We can find the best spots to visit.
Yes, that sounds good. We have everything we need.
Thanks! See you Saturday. Bye!
