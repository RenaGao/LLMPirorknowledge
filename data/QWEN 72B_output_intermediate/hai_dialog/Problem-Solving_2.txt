Hi, I good, thank you. How you are?
Oh, what kind of mistake?
Ah, I see. This is... how to say... not good. We need more time to finish, yes?
No problem, I understand. Mistake can happen. What we can do now?
That is good solution. Team will be happy. We will work hard to finish by new date.
I think is good now. We just need to tell everyone new date, right?
That is fine. Thank you for tell me and fix problem.
Yes, me too. Thank you, see you next meeting.
You too, take care! Bye!
