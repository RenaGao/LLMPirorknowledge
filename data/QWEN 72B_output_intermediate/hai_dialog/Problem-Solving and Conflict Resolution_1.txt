Yes, um... my internet very slow. It is very slow when I try to... uh, watch movie or do work.
Yes, I check my router and my computer. Both are okay. I think it is problem with the service.
Not yet. I donâ€™t know what to say. How to contact them?
Yes, I look, but I not sure what to say. They speak fast English.
Yes, that is helpful. I will say, "Hi, my internet connection is very slow. I need help to fix it."
Okay, and how to say that part?
Thank you! I will try that. I hope they can fix it soon.
Thank you so much! Goodbye!
