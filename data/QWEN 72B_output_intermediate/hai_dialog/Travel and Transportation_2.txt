Hi! It good, thank you. How about you, Nuch?
Yes, I think about it. How about we go to... um, how to say... beach town?
Yes, Hua Hin. It is nice place, have beautiful beach and good food.
I want to... um, go to beach and... uh, play some games. Maybe volleyball?
Oh, yes! That is good idea. And we can go for walk in town, see the market.
I am free next weekend. What about you?
Yes, good idea. We can leave... um, eight oâ€™clock?
Sure, I will come to your place at eight. I will bring some food too.
Okay, thank you. See you next Saturday!
Bye, Nuch! Have a good day!
