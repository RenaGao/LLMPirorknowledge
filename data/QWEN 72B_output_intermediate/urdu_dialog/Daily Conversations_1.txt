Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. Weekend... um, I think I go to the library. Yes, the new library. I hear it is very nice.
Yes, I went yesterday. Environment is very good, you know, quiet and clean.
I take some history books and one new storybook. And you? What do you want to read?
Oh, I like poetry too. In Urdu, we have many good poets. But, um, how to say... time is a problem sometimes.
Yes, that is a good idea. I will come. We can meet in the afternoon, maybe around two?
Definitely! I will bring my books. See you tomorrow, insha'Allah.
Bye-bye!
