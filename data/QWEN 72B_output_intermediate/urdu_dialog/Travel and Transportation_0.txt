Ah, yes! Hello, I am fine. I went to... um, how to say... the new city. It is called Lahore. Lahore is very... um, beautiful and... and full of history.
Um, I visit many places. I go to... to the Badshahi Mosque. It is very big and very beautiful. And I also go to the food street. The food there is... um, delicious.
I try... um, how to say... some kebabs and... and sweets. The kebabs are very tasty. And the sweets, they have many kinds, like jalebi and gulab jamun.
Yes, I go to the Lahore Fort. It is very old and... um, have many beautiful paintings and buildings inside. And I also visit the Liberty Market. There are many shops and... um, things to buy.
My favorite moment is... um, when I visit the food street. The people there are very friendly, and the atmosphere is... um, very lively.
Yes, I think you should... um, try to visit all the historical places. And also, try the local food. It is very... um, very good.
I stay there for... um, five days. It is enough time to see many things, but there are still more places I want to visit.
Yes, sometimes it is... um, hot. And the traffic is... um, very busy. But the people are very helpful, so it is not a big problem.
You are welcome! I hope you can visit Lahore one day. It is a very nice city.
