Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?
My goals... um, I want to improve my English and also, I want to read more books. Especially, um, books about history.
History is very important. It tells us about... how to say... our past. And it helps us understand many things.
I plan to join a language program. And also, um, go to the library often. I heard the new library is very good.
Yes, I went yesterday. The environment is very nice. And they have many books.
I took some history books and one, um... storybook. I like reading stories too.
Yes, I am interested in, um, ancient history and also, the history of my country.
Yes, I try to read one chapter every day. And I, um, join a study group. We discuss books and articles.
Sometimes, it is challenging. But I believe if I, um, manage my time well, it is possible.
Yes, that would be nice. Thank you for talking with me.
Thank you! You too. Bye!
