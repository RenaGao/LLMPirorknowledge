Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?
Yes, I have a lot of work, but I trying to manage. Um, how to say... I feeling a little tired.
Not really. I think I will just stay at home and rest. Maybe read some book.
Hmm, not really. I sleep maybe five or six hour a night. It is not enough, I know.
I try to eat healthy, but sometimes I just eat fast food because I am busy. It is not good, I know.
Yes, that is a good idea. How to say... meal prep?
Yes, I will try to drink more water. And also, I think I will go for a walk. It is good for health, no?
Yes, I will do that. I think it will help me feel better. Thank you for your advice, it is very helpful.
Yes, that would be nice. Take care, and I hope you have a good day.
Goodbye! Take care.
