Hi, I am good, thank you. And you, how are you?
Oh, yes, I have one. Um... recently, I go to wedding of my cousin.
It is very, very nice. There are many people, and everyone wear beautiful clothes. The decoration is also very pretty.
I like the music and dancing. And, uh, the food is, how to say, delicious. We have many different dishes, and I try almost all.
Yes, I like the biryani very much. It is, um, very tasty and spicy.
I feel very happy and, um, excited. It is, you know, not just party, but also family time. I meet many relatives and friends.
Ah, yes, there is one. My uncle, he... um, how to say... he do funny dance. Everyone laugh and clap.
It last for three days. Each day have different events, like mehndi, baraatis, and actual wedding.
Yes, it is tiring, but also very enjoyable. I am very happy I go.
Thank you, it is nice talking to you too. I hope you also have happy time soon.
You too, goodbye!
