Hi! I am fine, thank you. How you are?
Yes, um, we can... how to say... we can make party at my house. I have big room, and it is very nice.
Oh, um, we can make colorful balloons and streamers. And for food, I can cook some traditional Pakistani dishes. Um, like biryani and samosas.
Yes, please! It will be good if you help me. We can also ask others to bring some snacks and drinks.
I can buy cake, yes. Maybe chocolate cake, because Bilal loves chocolate.
We can send messages on WhatsApp. It is easy, and everyone will get it quickly.
Hmm, we can make it a movie night. Everyone can come dressed as their favorite movie character.
He likes action movies, so maybe we can watch something like ‘The Avengers’ or ‘Mission: Impossible.’
Yes, that will be very fun! Um, I think we should also make a playlist with his favorite songs.
Yes, he likes old Bollywood songs and some English songs by Ed Sheeran.
You are welcome! I am excited. It will be a great surprise for Bilal.
Yes, talk to you soon. Goodbye!
