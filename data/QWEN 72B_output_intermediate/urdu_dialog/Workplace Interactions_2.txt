Hello, I am good, thank you. And you?
Um, how to say... I think tomorrow afternoon is good. But, if team is busy, maybe we can meet in the evening.
How about three oâ€™clock?
We can meet in the conference room, right?
We should talk about the new project, and also, um, how to say... the progress of current tasks.
Yes, definitely. And, how to say... any support we need from management.
Maybe, um, how to say... some team building activities. It is good for morale.
Thank you. I think this is good plan.
Yes, I will be there. Thanks a lot.
You too. Goodbye!
