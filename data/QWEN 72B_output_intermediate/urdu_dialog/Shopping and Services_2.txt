Hello, Sarah. My name is Ayesha. Um... I have a problem with my recent purchase.
Yes, I bought a... how to say... a bookshelf from your online store. But when I received it, it was... broken.
Yes, the shelves... they are cracked. And the legs... um, they are not stable. They are loose.
I received it... um, two days ago.
No, this is my first time. I thought maybe it was just a small problem, but it is not.
Yes, I have them. The order number is... let me check... it is 123456.
I would like to exchange it, if possible. I still need the bookshelf.
Thank you, Sarah. That is very kind.
No, I think that is all. Thank you very much for your help.
You too. Goodbye, Sarah.
