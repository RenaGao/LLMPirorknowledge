Hi! Yes, of course. I am here to learn. How we start?
Ah, yes. We put fiction here, and non-fiction... um, here. Children's books, they go... here. Right?
Yes, we check for... um, torn pages, missing covers... things like that. If problem, we put aside?
Ah, the barcode scanner. I remember. We scan, and it goes in... um, the computer?
Yes, we put sticker... um, label on the book. With number or... um, section name?
Yes, we put them in right place. Then, they ready for people to borrow.
Um, just one. How we know if book already in the library?
Ah, I see. We check database, and if have, we thank donor. Got it.
No, I think I understand. Thank you for explaining everything clearly.
Yes, tomorrow. I will be ready. Thank you!
You too! Bye!
