Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?
Um, yes. I recently, um, complete one course. It is online course about digital marketing.
Well, I want to, um, learn new skill. And also, how to say... I want to improve my chances for better job.
I learn many things. Like, how to use social media for marketing. And also, um, how to create, how to say... digital ads.
I plan to, um, start small project. Maybe, um, help local business to, um, promote their products online.
Yes, I think about, um, small shop. It is, how to say, handicrafts shop. They make, um, beautiful things but, um, not many people know about them.
I am excited to, um, help them grow. And also, learn more about, um, marketing in real life.
I think it will, um, open many doors. And also, I will, um, gain more confidence. I want to, um, do more such projects in future.
You are welcome. Thank you for listening. It is, um, make me feel good.
You too! Goodbye.
