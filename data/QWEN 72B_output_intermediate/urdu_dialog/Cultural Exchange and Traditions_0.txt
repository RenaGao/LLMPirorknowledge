Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?
Oh, yes! Um, how to say... it is called Eid-ul-Fitr. It is a big festival in Islam.
It celebrates the end of Ramadan, which is a month of fasting. During Ramadan, we do not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset.
Yes, it is challenging, but also very rewarding. Um, on Eid, we wake up early and go to mosque for special prayer. Then we wear new clothes and meet family and friends.
Yes, we have... um, special foods. We eat sweet things like sheer khurma, which is a dessert made with vermicelli and milk. And we also distribute sweets to neighbors and relatives.
Yes, we give gifts to children and exchange greetings. We say "Eid Mubarak" to each other, which means "Happy Eid."
Yes, my favorite memory is when I was young, and my family and I went to my grandparents' house. We played games, and my grandparents gave us new clothes and toys.
Um, I hope to celebrate with my friends here. We plan to cook some traditional dishes and maybe visit a local mosque if possible.
You are welcome. It was nice to tell you about it.
Yes, talk to you soon. Goodbye!
