Yes, Ayesha. Of course, what is it?
Oh no, that sound very bad. What happen next?
That good, to act quick. But the client, they understand?
What kind of steps, you mean?
That very smart solution. I think, if you do this, the problem not happen again.
Yes, that good idea. Offer something they value, like free consultation or discount.
That show you really sorry and want to fix the mistake. I think client will appreciate.
You welcome. Mistake happen, but how you handle, that important.
Sure, Ayesha. Take care.
Bye!
