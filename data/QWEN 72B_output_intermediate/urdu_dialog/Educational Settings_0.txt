Hi! I am good, thank you. And you?
Yes, thank you. I am a bit confuse about the... um, the research paper topic. The professor say we should choose something from the last few lecture, but I am not sure what to pick.
Um, we talk about... um, the industrial revolution, and also, um, the impact of technology on society.
Yes, I like the idea about the impact of smartphones. But, um, how to narrow down the topic? It is very big.
I think, um, how they change the way we communicate. It is very interesting.
Yes, I see. It is good idea. But, um, how to start the research?
Okay, I will try. And, um, the professor mention we should use at least five sources. Is it enough?
Thank you very much. I feel more clear now. I will start my research today.
Thank you, I appreciate it. Have a nice day!
