Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, yes, I think we can go to a restaurant. Maybe an Italian place? They have very nice food.
Yes, I heard about a new place near the park. It is called... how to say... ‘La Bella Vita.’ They have good reviews.
I think we can go around seven. That is good time for dinner, yes?
Um, I like the walk in the park. It is very peaceful in the evening. Or we can go to a café for coffee.
Yes, after the walk, we can go to a café. There is a nice one near the park. They have good coffee and cakes.
Yes, that is perfect. I am looking forward to it.
Yes, I will be there. Thank you for planning this, Ayesha.
You too, Ayesha. Bye!
