Hello, Ayesha. I am good, thank you. How you are?
Yes, it is important. We have many work to do.
Okay, um... I need to finish the report for the market analysis. And also, I have to prepare the presentation slides.
Um, if I work hard, maybe by Thursday. But I need some data from you for the financial part.
I think I can start those on Friday. But how to say... I need your input on the key points to highlight.
Yes, that is good plan. I will send you the draft slides by Sunday evening.
Yes, we should keep in touch. It is important for good teamwork.
Good idea. I will set reminder on my phone.
Thank you, Ayesha. I am also confident. We make good team.
You too, have a good day! Goodbye.
