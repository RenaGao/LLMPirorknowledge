Ah, hello Ayesha. I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, I have started a little bit. But I not sure how to study effectively. How about you?
Practice questions, that sound good. But I think I need more. Maybe I can read some extra books.
Yes, I went yesterday. The environment there is very nice. I took some history books and a new storybook.
Yes, time is big problem. But if we make time, everything is possible, right?
That is a good idea. I would like to come with you. What time you want to meet?
Yes, 2 PM is perfect. I will see you at the library then.
See you tomorrow. Thank you, Ayesha.
