Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, I have. Um, I read it, but some parts are not clear to me.
I am not sure about the deadline for the first phase. Is it next week or the week after?
Okay, I understand. And what are the main tasks for this phase?
I think I can work on gathering data. And, um, how to say... conducting some interviews.
Yes, that is a good idea. When do you suggest we meet?
Yes, that works for me. I will make sure I am prepared by then.
Definitely. I will keep you updated and send you the data I collect.
Yes, I agree. It is important we finish on time. Thank you for the support.
You too. Bye for now.
