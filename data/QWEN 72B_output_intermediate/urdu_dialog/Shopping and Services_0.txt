Hi, good afternoon. I am looking for... um, new... new laptop. My old one, it is... it is not working properly.
Mostly for work. I do some... coding and design. And sometimes, I watch movies.
Um, I heard about... how to say... Apple and HP. But I am not sure which one to choose.
My budget is... um, around... 1000 dollars.
Yes, I would like to see it. Can you... show me?
( following ) Thank you. This one looks good. What is the... um, warranty?
That sounds good. I think I will take it. ( pauses ) One more thing, how long does it take to... deliver?
In-store pickup sounds good. I will come to pick it up tomorrow. ( smiles )
No, I think thatâ€™s all. Thank you so much for your help. You are very kind.
Thank you! Goodbye!
