Hi Ayesha! Yes, okay, my morning routine... um, I wake up early, around six o'clock. Then I, um... how to say... fresh up.
Yes, then I, um... drink water and do... some exercise. Like, um, stretching and... some, how to say... push-ups.
After that, I make breakfast. I usually eat... eggs and toast. Sometimes, um, paratha.
Yes, I think breakfast is important. It give me energy for whole day. And, um, I read newspaper while eating.
Your turn.
Oh, coffee, that must be nice. And what do you do after breakfast?
Meditation, that sounds good. I should try that sometime. Um, you do meditation every day?
Maybe I start with one day a week. It canâ€™t hurt, right?
My favorite part is... um, the quiet time in the morning. It is, um... peaceful. I like that.
You are welcome. Thank you for sharing yours, Ayesha. We should do this again sometime.
You too, Ayesha. Bye!
