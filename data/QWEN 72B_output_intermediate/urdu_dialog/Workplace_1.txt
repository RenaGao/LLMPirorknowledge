Good morning! My name is Bilal. I am from Islamabad. I... um, I study... how to say... history and literature at the university.
Yes, I have studied many different topics. For example, I have read books about ancient civilizations and modern history. Also, I like to read Urdu poetry and novels.
I am very interested in this position because I like to help people find information and books. Also, I want to learn more about library management and cataloging.
Yes, I have volunteered at my university library. I helped students find books and organized bookshelves. Also, I worked on a project to create a digital catalog for rare books.
I enjoy working in a team. I think communication is very important. I always try to listen to others and share my ideas. Um, teamwork makes... how to say... work easier.
I try to stay calm and organize my thoughts. I make a plan and focus on one task at a time. Um, I also talk to my colleagues for help if needed.
Yes, when I was organizing a book fair at the university, we had some technical issues with the computer system. I worked with my team to find a solution and we fixed the problem. It was a challenging but rewarding experience.
I want to become a librarian and help people access information. I also want to continue learning about new technologies and how they can improve library services.
Yes, I want to know more about the training program for new librarians. Also, how can I contribute to the libraryâ€™s community outreach programs?
Thank you very much. I am excited about this opportunity.
Thank you, it was a pleasure. Have a nice day!
