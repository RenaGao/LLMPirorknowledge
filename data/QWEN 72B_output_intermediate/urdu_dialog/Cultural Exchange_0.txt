Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Oh, sure! I want to tell you about Eid-ul-Fitr. It is very, um, important festival for Muslims in Pakistan.
Eid-ul-Fitr is at the end of Ramadan. Ramadan is... um, month of fasting. We, we donâ€™t eat or drink from sunrise to sunset.
Yes, exactly. And when Eid comes, it is like, big celebration. People, um, they wear new clothes, go to mosque for prayer...
We, um, visit family and friends. Children get, um, gifts and money from elders. And, we prepare special food, like, um, how to say... sweets and desserts.
We make sevaiyan, it is a sweet vermicelli pudding. And, um, barfi, it is a milk-based sweet.
We, um, have big, um, gatherings. People exchange, um, greetings and, um, they, they often cook together. It is, um, very, very joyful time.
Yes, we, um, clean our houses and, um, make, um, special decorations. And, we, um, buy new clothes for family.
Yes, it is. It brings, um, people together and, um, spreads, um, happiness.
You are welcome! I am happy to share. Maybe, um, you can visit Pakistan one day and, um, experience it yourself.
Thank you! You too, take care!
