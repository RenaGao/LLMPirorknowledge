Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?
Um, favorite holiday? I think it is Eid-ul-Fitr. Yes, Eid-ul-Fitr.
Um, it is special because it marks the end of Ramadan. We do... um... fasting for one month, and then we celebrate with family and friends.
We wear new clothes, and we go to mosque for prayers. Then, we visit relatives and exchange gifts. We also... um... how to say... we give money to children, called Eidi.
We eat many special dishes. Um, biryani, which is rice and meat. And also, we eat sweets like sheer khurma. It is very delicious.
I like the morning, when we go to mosque and pray together. It is very peaceful, and I feel very close to my community.
We clean our houses, and we decorate them. We also, um, how to say... we buy new clothes and gifts. And we cook a lot of food to share with family and friends.
Yes, I remember one year when I was a child. My whole family gathered, and we played traditional games. We also, um, how to say... we sang songs and danced. It was very joyful.
Thank you! I hope so too. And thank you for asking about my favorite holiday.
Yes, talk to you later. Goodbye!
