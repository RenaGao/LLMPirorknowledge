Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?
Um, not really. Just some reading, maybe. Why, do you have idea?
Oh, that is good idea! I think he will like that. When we do this?
Saturday sound good. Where we have party?
Yes, your place is nice. We need to invite people. Who we tell?
Okay, I will help with messages. What about food and drinks?
Yes, cake is good. And we can also make some homemade things, like pakoras or samosas.
Sure, I can do that. And we need decorations?
Okay, I will check online. And we need to be very careful so Bilal does not find out.
Yes, good plan. We can invite him to dinner somewhere and then bring him back to your place.
You are welcome. I am excited! See you this weekend.
Take care! Bye!
