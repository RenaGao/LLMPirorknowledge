Yes, of course. My name is Bilal. What can I help you with?
Sure, I can help you. The main library is not far from here. Um, how to say... you need to go straight for about two blocks.
Then, you have to turn left at the big tree. You will see a big tree, yes?
After the big tree, you go straight again for one more block. Then, you will see the library on your right side.
Yes, that is correct. The library is a big building with a lot of glass windows.
No, I think that is everything. The library opens at 9:00 AM and closes at 7:00 PM. They have a good collection of books and a quiet reading area.
You are welcome, Alex. If you need any more help, feel free to ask. Hope you enjoy the library!
You too, Alex. Goodbye!
