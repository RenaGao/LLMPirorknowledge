Oh, hello Ayesha! I am fine, how about you? What you want to talk about?
Ah, I see. I did not mean to give that impression. Um, I was just busy with my studies, you know.
Yes, I know. I feel bad about that. I have been working on my project and had a lot of reading to do.
Yes, I can do that. I will try to find more time. I miss our talks too.
Library? Yes, that’s a good idea. I need to get some books on history, and you can read what you like.
Um, let’s say afternoon? One o’clock?
Ok, I will be there. Thank you for understanding, Ayesha.
Yes, see you on Saturday. Take care!
Bye, Ayesha.
