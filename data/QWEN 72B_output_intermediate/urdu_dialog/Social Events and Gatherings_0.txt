Hello, Alex. My name is Ayesha. Nice to meet you, too.
I am from Pakistan. I live in Islamabad. How about you, Alex?
I am here for six month for my studies. I like it very much.
I am studying... um, how to say... international relations. Yes, international relations.
I like learning about different culture and, um, how countries work together. It is very important for peace.
Yes, I like to study... um, Japan. They have very beautiful culture and, um, history.
No, but I hope to travel soon. Maybe I will visit Japan one day.
