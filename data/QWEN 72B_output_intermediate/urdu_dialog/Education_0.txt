Hi! I am good, thank you. You?
Yes, I start preparing last week. Um, how to say... I read some chapters and make notes.
I finish chapter one and two. They are about... um, the history of the topic and basic concepts.
Yes, some of the theories in chapter two are... um, difficult. I not understand them fully.
Yes, that would be very helpful. When you are free?
Yes, library is good. What time?
2 PM is fine. Is it okay if I bring my notes?
Thank you. I really appreciate your help.
Yes, see you tomorrow. Thank you again. Goodbye!
