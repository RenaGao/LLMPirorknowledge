Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, I like reading books very much. My favorite is a book about Urdu poetry. Um... how to say... it is very beautiful and emotional.
I am reading a book called “Ghalib: Life and Times.” It is about Mirza Ghalib, a famous Urdu poet. He write very powerful poems.
Oh, I have heard about it. Is it difficult to read?
That sounds interesting. Why do you think I should read it?
Thank you for the recommendation. I will definitely try to read it. Do you have any other suggestions?
That sounds good too. I will look into it. Thank you for the suggestions.
Yes, that would be great. Thank you so much. Goodbye!
