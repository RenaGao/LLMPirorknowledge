Hi, Ayesha. I am good, how are you?
Yes, I look at it. But, um, I have some questions. It is not very clear to me.
Well, the, um, how to say... the part about the essay. I do not understand what teacher want us to write.
Yes, I know what is social media, but I am not sure what teacher mean by "impact." It is good or bad?
Oh, I see. So, I need to write about good things and bad things about social media.
Yes, I think I can use, um, how social media help people in disaster time. And also, how it spread fake news.
The assignment say it should be about three to four pages.
Yes, I feel better. But I think I still need to ask teacher some more questions to be sure.
It is due next Friday.
Yes, I will do that. Thank you for helping me, Ayesha.
Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
