Hi, thanks! Yes, it’s very nice. I like it a lot. How are you?
Oh, that sounds good. Um, my favorite dish is... how to say... karahi gosht. It’s a Pakistani dish with meat and tomatoes and spices. You’ll like it, I think.
Okay, so first, you need to cut the meat into small pieces. You can use chicken or mutton. Then, you put oil in a pan and fry onions and ginger and garlic. You have to stir it.
After that, you add tomatoes. They should be chopped. And then you put in the meat and mix it all together. You have to cook it for a while.
Yes, you add garam masala, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. And a little bit of salt. You have to mix it well and let it cook for about half an hour.
Yes, we usually serve it with naan bread or rice. It goes very well with that.
We can go tomorrow if you want. It’s not a problem.
Yes, 3 PM is fine. I will be ready.
Me too. Thanks for inviting me. I’m excited to cook with you.
You too, have a good evening! Bye!
