Hi, Bilal! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Yes, I have. Um, I watched this movie... how to say... "The Shawshank Redemption." It is very good movie, you know?
I like, um, the story. It is... how to say... very inspiring. And the acting is also very good.
Yes, I watched "Stranger Things." It is, um, very interesting. It is about, uh, some kids and, um, mystery things.
I like, um, "Friends." It is very funny, and the characters are, um, very nice.
"Game of Thrones"? I watched a few episodes, but it is, um, very... how to say... complicated. I did not finish it.
Yes, I recommend "The Crown." It is, um, about the British royal family. It is very, um, beautiful and, um, interesting.
I think I will watch, um, "Breaking Bad." My friend told me it is very good.
Yes, it was nice talking to you too. Take care, Bilal! Bye!
