Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, I think... the most important is... how to say... picture quality?
And also, it should have... good... um, battery life. Because we want to use it for long time.
Yes, zoom is also important. We should check if it has... um, optical zoom, not just digital zoom.
Hmm, it should be... not too heavy. I prefer something portable, so we can carry it easily.
Wi-Fi is good for sharing photos quickly. GPS can be useful... for... um, geotagging. So, yes, both are nice to have.
I heard good things about Canon and Sony. They are both reliable, I think.
I want to stay... um, under... 500 dollars, if possible.
Yes, that would be great. We can compare different models.
Thank you! I am excited to find a good camera.
Yes, have a good day! Bye!
