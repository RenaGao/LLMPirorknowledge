Ah, Ayesha! I am good, thank you. And how are you?
Um, I am busy with... how to say... my studies. I also go to library often. What about you?
I like history books and stories. Um, I read some history books and one new storybook recently. How about you?
Yes, I like it very much. But, um, sometimes I don't have time. You know, studies and all.
Not yet. I have some work to do, but maybe I will go to library again. You should come with me sometime. It is very quiet there, good for study.
Yes, that would be nice. We can meet in afternoon, see each other there.
No, I think that's it. Thank you for calling, Ayesha. It was nice talking to you.
Yes, take care. Bye bye!
