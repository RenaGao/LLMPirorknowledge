Hi, my name is Bilal. Nice to meet you, Alex. How you doing?
I am from Pakistan. I live in Karachi. How about you?
I am studying... um, business management in a university here. I like the program very much.
The professors are very nice, and the courses are interesting. I learn a lot. What about you? What do you do?
Oh, that is cool. I like technology too. Do you work on apps?
I use social media a lot, and also some educational apps for my studies. Do you like reading?
I like reading history books and Urdu poetry. I find them very interesting. What about you?
Oh, that sounds interesting. I have read some articles about AI, but I want to read more. Do you have any book recommendations?
Yes, I will check it out. Thank you! Do you like to go to the library?
Yes, I went there yesterday. The environment is very good, and they have a lot of resources.
Yes, I would like that. It sounds like a good idea.
Yes, that works for me. Letâ€™s meet on Wednesday at 2 PM.
You too, Alex. Bye!
