Hi, my name is Bilal. Nice to meet you.
Um, my favorite place to visit is... how to say... the new library in my city.
The environment there is very good. It is very quiet, and I can study a lot.
I usually read history books. And sometimes, I read storybooks.
Yes, I read a book about the Mughal Empire. It was very interesting.
I learn about the emperors, their architecture, and their culture. It is very rich history.
Yes, I try to go every week. It helps me to focus on my studies.
Yes, I want to improve my English. And also, I want to read more books on Urdu poetry.
My favorite poet is Allama Iqbal. His poetry is very deep and meaningful.
I enjoy the way he talks about freedom and the spirit of the people. It is very inspiring.
Thank you. It was nice talking to you.
Yes, that would be great. Goodbye!
