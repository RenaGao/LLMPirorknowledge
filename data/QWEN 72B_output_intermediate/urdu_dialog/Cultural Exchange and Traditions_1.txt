Hi, I am good. Thank you for asking. And you?
Yes, very interesting. In Pakistan, um, we have some different... how to say... rules and customs.
Um, in many homes, we eat on the floor. We spread a cloth, it is called a... dastarkhwan. And we sit on cushions.
We mostly eat with our hands, especially for... um, biryani and curries. But we do use spoons for soup and sometimes forks.
Um, we sit in a circle, how to say... everyone faces each other. It is very, um, social.
Yes, um, the eldest person usually sits at the head of the circle. And the youngest, they sit closer to the door.
Oh, yes, very important. We only use our right hand for eating. The left hand is considered... um, unclean.
Yes, in Pakistan, it is, um, a bit more relaxed, but still, we try to be clean and, um, respectful.
Yes, we say, um, "Bismillah" before eating. And after the meal, we say... um, "Alhamdulillah." It is, um, a way to show gratitude.
Yes, I understand. It is, um, similar in, um, showing good wishes.
Um, we try to, um, finish all the food on our plate. It is, um, disrespectful to waste food. And, um, we always, um, say thank you to the person who cooked the meal.
Yes, I think, um, both cultures value, um, gratitude and, um, respect.
You are welcome. It was, um, a pleasure to talk to you. Goodbye!
