Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?
Um, I am preparing to explain the concept of, um... photosynthesis, you know, how plants make their food.
Yes, some parts are tricky. I think the, um... the chemical reactions, they are a little confusing.
Yes, so, plants have this, um, green thing in their cells, called... chlorophyll. Chlorophyll, it um... it captures the sunlight.
Then, the sunlight, it, um... helps to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen, it is used to make glucose, and oxygen is released as, um, waste.
Yes, that is right. So, the chemical reaction is, um... 6 CO2 plus 6 H2O plus light energy, it makes, um... C6H12O6 plus 6 O2.
I will practice more. I think if I keep saying it, I will remember it better.
Um, I think, the, um... stages of photosynthesis. There are two main stages, right?
Oh, I see. So, in the light-dependent reactions, um... the light energy is used to make ATP and NADPH. And in the light-independent reactions, um... the, the, how to say... the cycle, it uses ATP and NADPH to make glucose.
Thank you, I think I understand now. It is much clearer.
Thanks a lot. See you in the group. Bye!
