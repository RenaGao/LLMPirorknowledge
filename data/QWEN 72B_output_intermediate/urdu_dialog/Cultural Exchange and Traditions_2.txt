Hi, I am good, thank you. How you are?
Yes, um, I want to have event where people can come and learn about Pakistani culture. Maybe have some music, food, and dances.
I want to make biryani, and samosas, and maybe some sweet dishes like kulfi. And we can have tea with cardamom.
For music, we can have qawwali and some classical Pakistani songs. And for dances, maybe we can have some folk dances like Bhangra and Luddi.
I was thinking maybe a community center or a park. Somewhere where people can gather and enjoy the atmosphere.
Hmm, I think weekend would be good. Saturday or Sunday, in the evening, around six or seven.
People can help by bringing dishes, or volunteering to set up or clean up. And also, they can bring their family and friends to enjoy.
Yes, it would be nice if you can help with promotion, maybe share on social media and help with decorations.
Thank you so much. I am excited to see it all come together.
Thank you, you too. Talk to you soon!
