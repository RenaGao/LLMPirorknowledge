Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, of course. I am happy to help. Um, what exactly is... how to say... this task about?
Yes, I can help. Can you tell me more about the categories we need to sort the books into?
That sounds good. I can take care of the Urdu books. And, um, how to say... the children’s books too, if you want.
I think I can manage. But if I have any question, can I ask you?
Um, maybe tomorrow in the afternoon? We can meet at the office and then go to the library together.
Two o’clock is good for me.
Yes, that is fine. I will be there. Thank you for asking me to help.
Yes, see you tomorrow. Goodbye!
