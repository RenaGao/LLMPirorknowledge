Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, I want to learn... how to say... cooking.
Because, um... I like to make food for my family. And also, it is fun to try new recipe.
I want to make, um... Pakistani food, like biryani and karahi. And also, maybe some Italian food, like pizza.
Yes, I start. I watch, um... how to say... cooking video on YouTube.
Yes, I try to make, um... biryani. But it is, um... hard. The spices are confusing.
Yes, I find, um... recipe that use less spice. It is easier to follow.
