Hello, I am fine, thank you. How are you?
Um, yes. The deadline is next week, right? I think we should finish... um, how to say... the main parts of the project by Thursday.
The, um... the report and the presentation. I will also work on the data analysis part.
For the report, maybe two days. And for the presentation, one day. The data analysis, um, one and a half days.
Yes, I think so. But, um, I need some help with the data analysis. It is… complicated.
The, um… the statistical models. I am not very… how to say… confident in this area.
Yes, that is good. I will prepare some questions for Tuesday.
Yes, that is a good plan. I will, um, start working on the report today.
Thank you. I will, um, keep you updated. Goodbye.
