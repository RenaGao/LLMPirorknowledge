Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. And you?
Yes, um, there are many differences. In Pakistan, we usually eat... um, how to say... with hands.
Yes, it is very common, especially for, um, traditional food. But in restaurants, we use cutlery.
In Pakistan, we often sit on floor, um, on cushions. It is more, um, comfortable and, how to say, family-style.
Usually, the oldest person sits at the head of the table, and, um, guests are given the best seats.
In formal settings, we, um, follow more Western-style dining. We use tables and chairs, and, um, the host often sits at the end of the table.
Yes, sharing food is very common. We often put all the dishes in the center, and everyone takes, um, what they like.
Yes, we usually serve, um, the guests and children first, and then, um, the host and older people.
Yes, it is different. Here, everyone usually serves themselves, and, um, sometimes, people eat in silence, which is, um, not common in Pakistan.
Yes, I do miss it. It is more, um, fun and, how to say, close with family and friends.
You are welcome. I am glad you find it, um, interesting. Maybe, um, we can try a Pakistani meal together sometime?
Yes, letâ€™s do that. Thanks for, um, the chat. It was, um, very nice.
