Hello, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, I was thinking... um, how to say... a city with good history and beautiful places. Maybe, um, Lahore?
I want to see the Badshahi Mosque and the Lahore Fort. And also, um, the Wazir Khan Mosque. They are very famous.
Yes, I want to try... um, how to say... biryani and samosas. They are very tasty.
I am free next week. Um, how about... Monday?
I think three days should be good. We can see many things in three days.
Not yet. Maybe we can look at some reviews and decide together.
Yes, I want to go to the markets and buy some souvenirs. And maybe, um, how to say... a boat ride in the park?
Yes, I am excited! Thank you for planning this trip with me.
You too! See you later. Goodbye!
