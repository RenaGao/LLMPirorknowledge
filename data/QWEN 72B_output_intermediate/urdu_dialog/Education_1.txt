Hi Ayesha. Um, I am good, thank you. And you?
Yes, I have some thought. But, um, it is little hard to explain. We have to do presentation on, how to say... climate change?
Um, I think we should talk about, how climate change affect... how to say... agriculture and, um, water supply. It is very important.
Yes, we can, um, start with, how to say... introduction to climate change. And then, we can talk about, how it affect agriculture and water supply. And at end, we can give, how to say... solution?
Yes, I find some good article and, um, report from, how to say... United Nations?
Yes, that is good plan. I will start work on agriculture. And, um, you can help me if I have any problem?
Yes, that is good. We can meet, um, every Wednesday?
No, I think we cover everything. Thank you for help, Ayesha.
Yes, see you on Wednesday. Bye, Ayesha.
