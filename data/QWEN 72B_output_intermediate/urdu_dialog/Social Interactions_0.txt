Hi, my name is Ayesha. Nice to meet you, Alex.
I from Pakistan. But now I live in this city for my studies.
I study... um... literature. Yes, literature. My focus is on... how to say... modern poetry.
Yes, I like Faiz Ahmed Faiz very much. His poems are so... um... powerful and full of meaning.
Oh, Alex, you not yet introduced yourself. What you do?
Ah, very interesting. Apps, like... um... for mobile phones?
I find it very good. The library here is amazing, and the professors are very helpful. I learn a lot.
Yes, I like to read books, and I also enjoy cooking. I often make Pakistani dishes for my friends.
Sure, I would like that. Do you like Pakistani food?
Good, we will have fun. Um, how to say... it is late now. We should maybe exchange numbers?
Thank you, Alex. It was nice to meet you.
