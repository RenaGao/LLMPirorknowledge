Sure, no problem. Which hotel are looking for? There are a few in the area.
Ah, I understand. The nearest hotel is called the Greenview Hotel. It is just down this street, on the left.
It is about a five-minute walk. You just need to follow this street, and you will see it on your left side.
No, it is quite big. It has a green sign with the name on it. You cannot miss it.
Yes, there is a nice caf√© just next to the hotel. You can have a tea or coffee there if you want.
Yes, they have a restaurant on the ground floor. It is open until 10 PM.
You are welcome. I am glad I could help. If you need any more help, just ask.
You too. Goodbye and take care!
