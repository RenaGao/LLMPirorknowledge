Hi! I am good, thank you. And you?
Yes, it will be nice. We have not done this in a long time. Um... how to say... it is a tradition in our family.
We will go to the park near our house. It is very beautiful. There are many trees and a small lake.
We will bring some... um... parathas and samosas. And also, some fruits and juice.
Yes, we will play cricket. My brother and I love playing cricket. And maybe, um... some card games for the kids.
We will leave around... um... 9 o'clock in the morning. It will be cool, and we can enjoy the day.
Yes, it looks like it will be sunny and not too hot. Perfect for a picnic.
No, I think we have everything covered. But thank you for offering. It is very kind of you.
Thank you! We are all very excited. I will tell you how it goes.
Thanks a lot! Take care.
Bye.
