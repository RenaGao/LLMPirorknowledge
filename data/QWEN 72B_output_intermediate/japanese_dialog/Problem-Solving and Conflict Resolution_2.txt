Hi, Sora here. I am good, thank you. How you are?
Yes, I agree. Project is important. How we should start?
Um... we need to... um, finish report and... and... data analysis.
Yes, presentation too. Maybe we can... um, how to say... divide work?
That sound good. I will work on data analysis. When we meet to check progress?
Friday afternoon is fine. But, um, maybe we can also send email every day for update?
Good. And, um, if we have problem, we can talk and find solution?
Yes, I understand. Thank you for plan.
Yes, we do our best. Thank you. See you Friday!
You too! Bye!
