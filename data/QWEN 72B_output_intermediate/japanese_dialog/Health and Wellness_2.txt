Hello, Sarah. I am good. Thank you. My name is Aki.
Ah, I like running. I run three times a week. And also, I do some yoga.
Um, I want to become more... more strong, and also, I want to lose some weight.
Not really. I think it is, um, hard for me. I do not know how to start.
Yes, I want to make my, um, arms and legs stronger.
Push-ups and squats? Yes, I think I can do that. How many times should I do them?
Yes, that sounds good. And, um, how often should I do them?
Okay, I understand. Thank you, Sarah.
I am excited. I think it will be good for me.
Yes, that sounds good. Thank you again, Sarah.
You too. See you soon!
