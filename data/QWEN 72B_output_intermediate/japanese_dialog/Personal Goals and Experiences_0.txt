Hi, it is good to see you too. My day... um, very good. Thank you for asking. And you?
Uh, my goal... I want to improve my English more. And also, I want to visit different place in Japan.
Um, I want to... how to say... talk with more people. And maybe, I want to study abroad one day.
I will practice more. I already read English book and watch movie, but I think I need to speak more. Maybe, I will join language exchange group.
Yes, I want to go to Hokkaido. I hear it is very beautiful, especially in winter. And also, I want to visit Okinawa. It have nice beach and good food.
I will save money and plan trip carefully. Maybe, I will go with friends. It will be fun.
Um, I want to... how to say... be more healthy. I will exercise more and eat healthy food. I think it is important for my life.
I will set small goal and track my progress. And maybe, I will find exercise partner. It help me to keep going.
Yes, I hope I can achieve all my goal. It will be good year.
Yes, that would be nice. Thank you for talking with me. Goodbye!
