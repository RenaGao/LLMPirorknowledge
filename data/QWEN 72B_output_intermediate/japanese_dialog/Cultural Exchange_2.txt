I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, favorite holiday... It is hard to choose, but I think New Year’s Day is special.
I visit shrine with my family. We pray for good luck and health. And, um... we eat special food.
We eat mochi, which is sticky rice cake. And also, um... osechi-ryori. It is... um, how to say... traditional New Year’s food.
Yes, that is right. Each dish has special meaning. For example, um, kohaku kamaboko is pink and white fish cake. It means good fortune.
We watch New Year’s TV program called “Kohaku Uta Gassen.” It is like music show with famous singers.
I like spending time with family. We talk and laugh, and it is very warm and happy.
You are welcome. It was nice to talk about it.
You too! Bye-bye!
