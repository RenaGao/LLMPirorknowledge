Hello! I am good, thank you. Yes, I want to learn... um... cooking. How to say... traditional Japanese cooking.
Um... because... I like to eat, of course, but also because it connect to culture. I want to know more about my own culture and share with other people.
Yes, I want to learn how to make... um... sushi and tempura. They are very popular, and I think they are not so easy to make.
Yes, I make miso soup and... um... okonomiyaki. They are ok, but I want to improve.
I think I will watch some video on YouTube first. And maybe, um... find a class if I can.
Not yet, but I will look for one. I hear there are many good ones.
Yes, I like reading and... um... hiking. I enjoy being in nature.
Yes, I like to go to... um... how to say... mountain near my home. It is peaceful and beautiful.
I think it will make me more... um... self-sufficient. And also, I can share my cooking with friends and family.
Yes, I want to cook for my family when I visit them next month.
Thank you! It was nice talking to you, too. Bye!
