Hi, Sora! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Sure! One of the most famous is... um, how to say... Cherry Blossom Festival. In Japanese, we call it "Hanami."
It usually happens in April, but it depends on weather. In Tokyo, it is often end of March or early April.
People go to park and have picnic under cherry blossom trees. We eat special food, um... "bento," and drink sake.
Bento has many things. Um... rice, fish, pickles, and sometimes, um... uh, sushi.
Yes, some people, um... sing songs and dance. It is very fun and relaxing time with family and friends.
Yes, Gion Matsuri in Kyoto is very famous. It is in July and has big parade with floats.
Yes, I have been. It is very beautiful and crowded, but it is worth it.
You should! I think you will enjoy it very much.
Yes, talk to you later! Bye-bye!
