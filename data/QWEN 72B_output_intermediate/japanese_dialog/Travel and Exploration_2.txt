Ah, yes, thank you. I... um, I need to go to the... how to say... old temple. Do you know where it is?
Yes, that’s right. How do I get there?
Um, where is the main station?
Ah, yes, I see the red building. So, I go there, and then take the bus?
Thank you. How long does it take to get to the temple?
Okay, I understand. Is it far to walk from the bus stop?
That sounds nice. Thank you so much for your help.
Um, no, I think that’s it. I can do it now. Thank you again.
Yes, I heard it is very beautiful. I am looking forward to it.
Goodbye! Thank you very much.
