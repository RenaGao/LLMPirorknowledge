Hi, Sora! I am good, thank you. How you are?
That is good idea! I like it. What kind of event you think?
Yes, festival is great! We can have food, like sushi and tempura. And, um... how to say... cultural performance?
Um, for arts, we can have calligraphy. And, um... paper folding. Oh, origami!
Yes, workshop is good. We can teach people, and they can make paper crane, nezumi, and other things.
Yes, sushi and miso soup. And we can have ramen and takoyaki as well.
Um, we can use community center. It is big and have many room for activities.
How about next month? It is not too soon, and we have time to prepare.
Me too! It will be fun to share our culture with others.
Yes, see you soon! Arigatou!
Bye, Sora!
