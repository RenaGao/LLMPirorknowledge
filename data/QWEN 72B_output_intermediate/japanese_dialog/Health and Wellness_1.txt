Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, I have been, um, working a lot. And also, I think I not eating good food. Maybe that is why.
No, I think I not sleep enough. I have to finish my, um, project for work.
Not really. I think I should, um, try that. It might help.
Oh, I see. I will try to, um, turn off my phone and computer. Thank you for advice.
Yes, I need to eat more vegetables and fruits. Maybe I can, um, prepare meals ahead of time.
I, um, think I should drink more. I often forget.
Good idea! I will do that. Thank you so much for all the advice.
Thank you! I will try my best to follow your advice. Let's meet again soon to see how I am doing.
Yes, take care! Bye!
