Hi, I am good, thank you. How about you?
Ah, yes, the exam. I feel... um, okay. I study a lot, but sometimes I worry about... um, the questions.
I think... the math problems. They are hard for me. And also, the essay part. I not sure how to... um, how to say... write it good.
Yes, I practice, but I still make mistake. I think I need more help with... um, structure.
That would be great! I think it will help me a lot. When is good for you?
Saturday is good. What time?
Yes, 2 p.m. is fine for me. I will bring my notes and some practice questions.
Yes, I bring my laptop. It will be useful for... um, writing and checking things.
I hope so. Thank you for helping me, Sora. I really appreciate it.
See you on Saturday! Goodbye!
