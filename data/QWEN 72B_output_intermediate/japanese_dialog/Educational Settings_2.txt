Hi, Sora. Yes, I am ready. Um, I little nervous about explaining complex topic, but I try my best.
I not sure about... um, how to explain... the concept of relativity in physics. It is very confusing for me.
Um... how to say... it is about space and time. They are not fixed, but they change depending on speed and gravity.
Spacetime... I see. So, if I move very fast, time will go slower for me compared to someone who is not moving?
Ah, I understand. So, if I on Earth, time for me is slower than someone in space?
Wow, that is really interesting. Um... how to say... it is hard to imagine, but I think I begin to understand.
Yes, I will do that. Thank you, Sora. You explain very clearly.
Yes, I feel much better. I will practice more and try my best in the study group.
Sure, thank you. Goodbye, Sora!
