Hello, Sora! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, yes. We should talk about the project deadlines, I think. And also, um, how to say... team communication.
Yes, maybe we can talk about the budget. And also, um, team building activity. It is good for morale, I think.
Yes, that sounds good. Should we decide on a time for the meeting?
How about Wednesday? After... um, lunch time?
Yes, 2 p.m. is good. And where should we meet? In the conference room?
Thank you, Sora. I will prepare for the meeting.
Me too. See you on Wednesday!
You too. Bye!
