Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, my favorite place... it is Kyoto. Kyoto very special to me.
Kyoto have many... um, historical place. Temple, shrine, and old building. Very beautiful and peaceful.
I like Fushimi Inari Shrine. Very famous, have many torii gate. Beautiful in autumn. Many tourist come, but still nice.
Um, food. Kyoto food very good. Um, kyo-ryouri, traditional cuisine. Very delicious.
Yes, um... yudofu. It is tofu in hot water. Very simple, but very tasty.
Yes, um, kaiseki. It is, um, how to say... multi-course meal. Very fancy, very good.
I use bus and train. Kyoto have very good public transportation. Very easy to use.
Yes, um, wear comfortable shoe. You need to walk a lot. And, um, try to go early in the morning. Less crowd.
Um, spring and autumn. Spring for cherry blossom, autumn for leaf. Very beautiful.
You are welcome! I hope you visit Kyoto soon.
You too! Bye-bye!
