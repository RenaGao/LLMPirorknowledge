Um, hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Uh, yes... I think Kyoto is very nice place. Many historical things and good food.
I want to see... um, how to say... famous temples and gardens. And also, I want to try... um, Japanese thing for cooking, kyou-ryouri.
Yes, I want to go... um, shopping in... Gion? And maybe see geisha.
I think shinkansen is good. It is fast. But... might be little expensive.
Express bus... it is good idea. Cheaper and not too slow.
How about... um, nine o'clock in the morning?
Yes, station. Good plan. Thank you!
See you tomorrow! Have a good day!
