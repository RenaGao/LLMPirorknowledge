Hello, I am Yuki. Nice to meet you too, Alex.
Um, I like to read... um, book. And I enjoy cooking. How about you?
I like to read... um, how to say... novels. Japanese novels, especially. And also, um, science fiction.
Yes, I like... um, how to say... Asimov. And Murakami.
My favorite is “Norwegian Wood.” It is very... um, emotional.
I like to cook Japanese food, like sushi and ramen. And sometimes, um, Italian food too.
Yes, I like to make... um, miso soup and, um, tempura. And for Italian, I make pasta with tomato sauce.
Um, for miso soup, you need to... um, how to say... mix miso in hot water. And for tempura, you need to, um, dip the vegetables in batter and fry them.
I like to cook, um, American food. Like, um, hamburgers and, um, pizza.
Yes, I like to make, um, cheeseburger with, um, special sauce. And for pizza, I make, um, pepperoni.
Yes, that sounds fun! I would like that very much.
Yes, I hope so too. It was nice talking to you, Alex. Goodbye!
