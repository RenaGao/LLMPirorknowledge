Hello, Sora! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Sure, that sounds good! In Japan, we have many rules about eating. For example, we always say "itadakimasu" before we start eating and "gochisousama" after we finish.
Yes, chopsticks are very important. We never point with them or stick them upright in our rice, because it is like a funeral ritual.
Ah, I see. In Japan, we also use a small plate called "o-zara" for our rice, and we place our chopsticks on a chopstick rest.
Yes, for guests, we often serve food on separate plates, and we make sure to offer them the best pieces. We also try to create a comfortable atmosphere.
I understand. It sounds very friendly. In Japan, we also have a custom called "shime," where we finish a meal with a light dish like a salad or a dessert.
Yes, I like that too. It's fun to try different things.
You are welcome, Sora. It was fun talking to you.
Yes, see you later! Take care!
