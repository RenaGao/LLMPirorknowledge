Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
My favorite meal is um... it is called "donburi." It is rice bowl with different toppings.
Sure. First, I cook rice. I use Japanese short-grain rice. Then, um... I prepare some toppings. For example, I like to use chicken and vegetables.
I use, um... carrot, onion, and sometimes... um, how to say... green beans?
I cut chicken into small pieces and then I cook it with soy sauce, mirin, and a little bit of sugar. I also add some ginger for flavor.
I put the cooked rice in a bowl. Then, I add the chicken and vegetables on top. Sometimes, I add a little bit of um, how to say... grated daikon?
I make a sauce with soy sauce, mirin, and a little bit of dashi. I pour it over the toppings.
Sometimes, I add a boiled egg on top. It is very delicious.
You are welcome! I can make it for us sometime. How about this weekend?
No problem! See you this weekend. Bye!
