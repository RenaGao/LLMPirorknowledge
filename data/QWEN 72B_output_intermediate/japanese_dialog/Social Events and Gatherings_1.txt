Hello! I am good. How about you?
Oh, that is good idea! Um, how to say... sounds fun.
Let's see... How about this Saturday? It is... not too busy for me.
Maybe... around 7 p.m. It is good time, I think.
Um... we can have it at my place. It is... big enough for everyone.
Yes, I have. We can invite... um, how to say... our close friends. About 10 people, I think.
I can make some Japanese food. And we can buy some drinks and snacks from the store.
Yes, it would be great if you can help. We can... um, cook together.
We can use balloons and streamers. It is... simple but nice.
Yes, that is good idea. I will create the group chat.
Yes, I think so too. Thanks for organizing this.
Yes, see you then! Thank you!
