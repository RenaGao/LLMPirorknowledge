Hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, yes. In Japan, we have many rules for eating. For example, we say "itadakimasu" before eating and "gochisousama" after.
"Itadakimasu" means... um, "I receive" or "I am grateful for the food." And "gochisousama" means "thank you for the meal."
Yes, chopsticks are very important. We do not stick them upright in the rice because it looks like a funeral thing. And we do not pass food with chopsticks directly to another person's chopsticks.
In some traditional places, we sit on the floor with cushions. The oldest or most important person usually sits in the seat of honor, which is farthest from the door.
Yes, it is different. In Western countries, people use more utensils like forks, knives, and spoons. And the seating arrangement is often around a table, not on the floor.
Um, in Japan, we do not tip, but in many Western countries, tipping is expected. Also, in Japan, we often bring omiyage, which is a gift, when visiting someoneâ€™s home.
You are welcome! It is interesting to talk about different cultures.
Thank you! Take care, too. Goodbye!
