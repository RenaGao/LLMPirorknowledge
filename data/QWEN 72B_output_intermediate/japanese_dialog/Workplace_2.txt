Ah, hello! Nice to meet you. My name is Yuki. Um, please, go ahead.
Yes, sure. I can help. What I need to do, exactly?
Ah, marketing... um, documents. So, I put them in marketing folder, right?
Ah, I see. Label with title and date. Got it. How to label, um, in computer?
Right-click, then properties, and details... Yes, I understand. What next?
Backup... ah, copy files to external hard drive. Where is hard drive?
Ah, thank you. I will follow you.
