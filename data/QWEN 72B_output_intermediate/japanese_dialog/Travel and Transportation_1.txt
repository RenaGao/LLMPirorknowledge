Hello, Iâ€™m Aki. Nice to meet you. I am good, thank you. How are you?
Ah, Kyoto Hotel. Um, yes, I know where it is. It is not far from here. You walk... um, you go straight on this street for about five minutes.
Then, you turn... uh, right. Right at the big sign. It is easy to see. Big red sign.
After turn, you walk maybe three minutes. Hotel is on your left. You will see it. It is big building.
Yes, it is safe. This area is very safe. Many people walk at night. You do not worry.
Oh, if you get lost, you can ask people. They are friendly. Most people speak some English. Also, you can call hotel. They help you.
Um, there is small park near hotel. It is nice place for relaxing. And, um, many restaurants around. You can try Japanese food.
You are welcome. I am glad to help. If you need more help, you can ask me. Good luck!
You too. Take care! Bye-bye!
