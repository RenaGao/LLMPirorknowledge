Hi, Sora! I am fine, thank you. How about you?
Yes, I remember. We are going tomorrow, right?
Oh, no! Um, what time did you book?
I see. It is early... but, um, how to say, I can manage. What do you think?
That would be great. Thank you for fixing it, Sora. I do not mind waiting a little.
No problem. I am looking forward to our trip. Kyoto is beautiful, and the food is amazing.
Yes, I want to try kaiseki. It is very special.
I will do some research and send you some options. We can decide together.
Sounds good. I will see you at the station tomorrow morning at 9.
Good night, Sora! See you tomorrow!
