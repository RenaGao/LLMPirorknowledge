Hi, Aki! I am good, thanks. Um, my morning routine, it is... simple, but I like it. I wake up early, around six.
First, I... um, take shower. Then I do some stretch. Stretching help me feel good.
Yes, I follow video on YouTube. It is... um, how to say... guide for morning stretch.
After stretch, I make breakfast. I like to eat healthy in morning. Usually, I have... um, porridge with fruits and yogurt.
Yes, I add banana and blueberry. Sometimes, I use apple or pear too.
After breakfast, I read book. I like to read news or... um, magazine. It help me start day with good information.
Then, I check email and plan my day. I write down task in my planner.
Not really, but sometimes I go for short walk in park near my house. It make me feel fresh.
Oh, I am curious! Can you tell me?
That sound nice. I want to try meditation sometime.
Yes, I am excited! We meet at the station, right?
Okay, see you then! Have a good day, Aki!
