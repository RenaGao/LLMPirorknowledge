Ah, yes, welcome! These kimono, they are very beautiful. This one, it is 5000 yen.
Sure! This kimono is made with silk. It is hand-dyed, and the pattern is traditional. We make it here in Kyoto.
Um, how to say... I can give you a discount. Maybe... 4500 yen?
Let me see... (pauses) Okay, I think I can do 4200 yen. Is this good for you?
I see. (pauses) Okay, 4000 yen. But this is the best price I can give.
Great! I will wrap it for you. (wraps the kimono) Here you go. Thank you for your purchase!
You too! Arigatou gozaimasu. Goodbye!
