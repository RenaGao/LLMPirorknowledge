Hi, Teacher. I, um, I am good. Thank you. How are you?
Ah, yes. I, um, have question about, um... homework.
The, um, last part of the assignment. It says, “Discuss the impact of... um, technology on society.” I not sure what to write.
Oh, I see. So, I can write about, um, how people use, um... how to say... phone or internet to talk with each other?
Yes, yes. I understand. And, um, for education, I can write about, um... online class?
