Hello! My name is Aki. Nice to meet you.
Ah, yes. I like to... um, cook. Cooking is my hobby.
I cook Japanese food mostly. Sometimes, um, Italian food. I like pasta and pizza.
Um... how to say... Cooking is relaxing for me. I like to create new dishes and see people enjoy my food. It make me happy.
Yes, my favorite is... um, sushi. I make sushi often. It is... how to say... fun to make and eat.
Yes, I think... um, the key is in the rice. It has to be just right. Not too wet, not too dry. And um, the fish must be fresh.
Yes, often. I invite friends over and we cook together. It is good time.
Yes, I want to try making... um, ramen. I hear it is difficult, but I want to do it.
Yes, there is a Japanese market near my house. They have everything I need.
Um, I like to read books. I read a lot of... um, history books. And I also enjoy hiking.
Thank you! It was nice talking to you.
You too! Bye!
