Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?
Sure! Um, how to say... One of my favorite festival is called... uh, Hanami.
Yes, exactly! People go to park and see cherry blossom. It is very beautiful.
People bring food and drink. Um, we have picnic under the cherry tree. And sometimes, there is music and dance.
We eat... um, how to say... bento. It is like, box with rice and different food. And also, we have sake and other drinks.
Yes, sometimes there are special events. Like, um, lanterns at night. And some cities have big parade.
Um, Kyoto is famous for Hanami. Many people go there to see the best cherry blossom. And also, Tokyo is popular.
Yes, Hanami is not only about seeing flowers. It is about enjoying time with family and friends. It is very important in Japanese culture.
You are welcome! I hope you can experience Hanami one day.
Yes, see you later! Thank you.
