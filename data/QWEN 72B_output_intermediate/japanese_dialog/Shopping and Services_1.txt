Hello, Aki! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Oh, camera? Um, yes, I read some review. I think... um, Canon and Nikon are good. How you want to use it?
For travel and video, maybe... um, mirrorless camera is better. It is not heavy and good for taking picture and video.
Yes, I use Sony. It is... um, very clear picture and easy to use. But, it is little bit expensive.
Sony camera have good battery, but... um, if you take many picture, maybe you need extra battery.
Yes, Sony have many lens. You can find them in shop or online. And, some lens are not so expensive.
Yes, it is... um, easy to understand. Menu is clear, and you can change setting quickly.
Sonyâ€™s image quality is very good. It have good color and sharp picture. Some people say it is better than... um, other camera.
Um, yes. I think, practice is important. You need to... um, try different setting and see what work best. And, read manual also helps.
You are welcome, Aki. I hope you find good camera.
Goodbye, Aki! See you later!
