Hello, Emily. My name is Sora. I have problem with new camera I buy last week.
Um, when I take picture, sometimes it is... um, not clear. It is blurry.
Yes, I wait for focus, but still, some pictures are blurry.
Yes, I clean lens. Not help.
Model is C-5000. I buy it last Tuesday.
I think so. It say in manual warranty is one year.
Um, how to say... return label is good. I live far from store.
Regular mail is fine.
No, that is all. Thank you, Emily.
Thank you. You too. Goodbye.
