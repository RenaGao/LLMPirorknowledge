Hi! I’m good, thank you. How are you?
Um... I don’t have plan. What about you?
That sounds nice! Where are you thinking?
Ah, I see. San Francisco, it famous for Golden Gate Bridge, right?
Oh, Alcatraz, I heard it is... um... what is word... prison?
That sounds interesting! And food, it good too?
Um, how we go there? By car?
I think train is good. Um, how long it take?
Ah, 10 hours. That is long, but maybe it fun.
Yes, that is good idea. I bring some snacks too.
8 a.m., um, it early, but I can do. Okay, 8 a.m. at train station.
Me too! See you Saturday! Bye!
