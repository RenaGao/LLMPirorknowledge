Hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, yes. Last week, I go to Kyoto with my friend. It is very beautiful city.
We visit many historical place. Um... how to say... like temple and shrine. And we eat very good food.
My favorite part is visit Fushimi Inari Shrine. It is very famous with many torii gates. It is very beautiful, and I take many picture.
I feel very happy and peaceful. Also, I feel proud because Japan have many great culture.
Yes, little bit. We have little trouble with transportation. We use train, but sometimes it is confusing. But, we help each other and find way.
We eat kaiseki ryori. It is very special and delicious. Also, we eat matcha dessert. It is very sweet and good.
Yes, we eat yatai food. It is very tasty. We eat takoyaki and taiyaki.
I remember the kindness of people. Many people help us, and we make new friend. It is very nice experience.
You are welcome. I am glad to share. Thank you for listening.
You too. See you!
