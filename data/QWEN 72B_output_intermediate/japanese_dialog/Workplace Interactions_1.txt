Ah, I see. It is here. What is next?
Um, project name... how to choose good name?
Okay, I understand. Spring Marketing 2024. And start date is... um, April first?
End date... um, how to say... June thirty?
Main goals... to increase sales and... um, how to say... customer engagement?
Okay, I write it. Next step?
I see. I add team members. How many we need?
Marketing, design, and sales. I add them. What is next?
Tasks... um, like... create content, design ads, and... um, send emails?
Okay, I add tasks and deadlines. Last step?
I review everything. It looks good. I click "Save Project."

Thank you, you too! Goodbye!
