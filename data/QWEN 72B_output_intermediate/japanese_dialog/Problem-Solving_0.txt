Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. And you?
Um, yes, I think so too. I feel... how to say... a bit confused about what happened.
Oh, I see. I thought you... um... prefer other places. I did not know you want to go to Kyoto.
Yes, I do! I love Kyoto, but I thought you... you know, like bigger cities more.
Yes, maybe. But I also like... um... quiet places, you know?
That sounds really nice! I would love that. Thank you for explaining.
Yes, I am! I am really looking forward to it now.
Sure, what time is good for you?
That works for me. See you then!
Yes, see you tomorrow! Take care!
