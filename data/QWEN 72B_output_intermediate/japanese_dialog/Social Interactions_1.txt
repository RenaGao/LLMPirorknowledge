Ah, hello! I do not have special plans for tomorrow. How to say... Why you ask?
Yes, that is nice idea! Aki like surprised, I think. What we do?
Kyoto, ah! Kyoto have many history place. And also, um... good food, right?
Yes, I like that. What we need for party?
Um, we can use, how to say... balloons? And also, um, colorful paper, for streamers?
We can bring some, um, Japanese snacks. Maybe, um, mochi and, ah, senbei?
Yes, I look. Bullet train is fastest, but maybe, um, little bit expensive.
Ah, express bus, that is good idea. It is cheaper and not too long, I think.
Um, nine a.m., that is okay for me.
Yes, that is good. I will bring snacks and, um, decorations.
You are welcome. I am happy to help. See you tomorrow!
