Hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, yes, actually I read one. It is called *The Night Circus*.
I really enjoy it. It is... um, how to say... magical and mysterious.
The story is about two magicians and their competition. They create this amazing circus, and everything is very... um, colorful and exciting.
Yes, I think you will like it. If you enjoy fantasy and adventure, it is perfect.
My favorite is Celia. She is very strong and... um, clever. She solve many problem with her magic.
You are welcome. I hope you enjoy it. If you have other book you like, can you tell me?
Yes, please do. Um, what time is it now?
Oh, I have meeting soon. I need to go. Thank you for talking with me.
Thank you! Goodbye!
