Hi, Aki! I am good, thank you. Um, I started a little bit. How about you?
Not really. I am little nervous. How to say... I have trouble with the grammar section.
The passive voice. I always forget when to use it.
Yes, I try that. Um, what you do to prepare?
Flashcards sound good. I will try. And past exam questions too.
Sure, I would like that. When is good for you?
That sound good. What time?
Yes, 2 p.m. is fine. I will be there.
No, I think that covers it. Thank you for the tips, Aki.
Thank you! Good luck to you too. See you tomorrow!
Bye, Aki!
