Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, um, we are... how to say... almost finish. We are close to complete the main part of the project. But there is still some, um, checking to do.
I think, um, one more week. We need to fix some small problem and do final test.
Yes, we can do it. But, um, we need to work, uh, overtime this week to make sure everything is perfect.
Yes, I send email this morning. I tell everyone about the, uh, deadline and what they need to do.
No, I think we can manage. But, um, if there is any problem, I will let you know.
Yes, that is good idea. I will keep you update.
Thank you. I am confident too. We work hard.
You too. See you tomorrow!
