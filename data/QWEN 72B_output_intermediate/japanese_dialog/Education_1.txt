Hi, I am good. Thank you. How are you?
Yes, I have... um, quantum mechanics. It is very difficult for me.
The superposition principle. I do not understand... how to say... how particle can be in many places at same time.
Ah, I see. So, it is like coin. But, how we measure it? How we know it is heads or tails?
I think I understand. But, why it is... how to say... why it is so strange?
Yes, it is very different. So, can we use this in real life?
Wow, that is interesting. I want to learn more about it.
Yes, that sounds good. Thank you for explaining.
See you there! Bye!
