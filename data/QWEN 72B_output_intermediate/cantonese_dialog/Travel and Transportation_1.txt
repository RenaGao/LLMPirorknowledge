Oh, sure! Sure, no problem. Which hotel you want to go?
Yeah, I know. It is... um, how to say... a bit far from here, but not too far. You go straight this road for about... um, ten minutes.
Yes, straight. Then, you turn left at the big roundabout. There is a big roundabout, you see?
After roundabout, you go straight again. You will see a big sign say "Ocean View Hotel." It is on your right side.
You are welcome. It is not difficult. If you get lost, you can ask local people. We are very friendly.
By foot, maybe twenty minutes. If you walk fast, maybe fifteen. But it is nice weather today, so you can enjoy walk.
No, no. It is safe. Just be careful of cars when you cross the road. The traffic can be a bit busy.
No problem! Hope you have good time. Enjoy your stay at Ocean View Hotel!
You too! Bye-bye!
