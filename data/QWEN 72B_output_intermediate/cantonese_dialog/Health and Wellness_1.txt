Hello, I am Mei. Nice to meet you. I want to... um, get fit and healthy.
Yes, I want to lose some weight and have more... more... energy, you know?
Now, I go... um, go gym two time in week. But I want to do more.
I do some running, and also, um... how to say... weight lifting?
I try yoga, but I find it... um, hard to focus. Maybe I try more cardio?
Yes, I want to run 5K race in three month. That is my goal.
Sound good! I... I trust you.
Three days, okay. I can do that. Thank you, Alex.
Yes, Tuesday is good. See you next Tuesday!
You too. Goodbye!
