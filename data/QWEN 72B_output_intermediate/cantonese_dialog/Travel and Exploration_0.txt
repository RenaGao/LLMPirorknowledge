Hello! I am fine. Um, how to say... I think going to a new city is good. Maybe... um, how to say... a place with nice beach and food?
Yes, I go to... um, Hong Kong last summer. It have very nice beach and yummy food.
We can go shopping, eat in nice restaurant, and visit... um, how to say... big building, like Victoria Peak.
Yes, we can take MTR, it is subway, and also we can take bus. It is easy to go everywhere.
We can stay in hotel near the beach. It is more fun, I think. And also, it close to many restaurants.
Um, how about Friday afternoon? We can start early and have more time to enjoy.
Let’s meet at... um, how to say... train station at three o’clock?
Yes, we need to bring swimsuit, sunscreen, and light clothes. And also, ID card and money.
You welcome! I am excited. See you on Friday!
