Hey Mei, I am good, thanks. Um, I think, I like to go for walk, but maybe, how to say... need more ideas.
I try jogging, but I find it tiring. Maybe, how about... um, swimming? My friend say it good for health.
Yes, I like water. Maybe I go swimming more often. And, how to say... exercise at home, like yoga or... um, stretching?
I have small room, yes. I can use mat and... um, video, online for follow.
Yes, I try eat more fruits and vegetables. I cook at home, um, healthy food.
Yes, I like make stir-fry with chicken and vegetables. It is fast and taste good.
