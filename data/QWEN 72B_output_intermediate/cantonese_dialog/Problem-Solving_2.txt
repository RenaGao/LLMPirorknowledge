Ah, I am good, thank you. How about you?
Oh, really? What kind of mistake?
Oh no, that is... um, how to say... not good. But, it is okay. Mistake happen.
Yes, I think that is good idea. We can check the result again and make sure it is right.
Um, maybe we can... how to say... double-check each otherâ€™s work to avoid mistake in the future?
No problem. I happy to help. We can do this together.
Yes, I think that is good. Afternoon is okay for me.
2 p.m. in the library, yes. See you then.
No worries. See you tomorrow. Bye!
