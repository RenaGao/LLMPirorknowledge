Hi Mei, I am good, thank you. I have think about weekend plan already. You have idea?
Oh, dinner sound good. We can go to new restaurant, um, I hear about one... how to say... Italian food. It is near my place.
Yes, it call "Trattoria Bella." I read review, it is very good. We can try it. And after, maybe we go see movie?
Um, we can see new action movie. I like action, you like?
Let see... restaurant open at 6, so we can meet at 5:30? It give us time to find parking.
Hmm, dessert sound nice. Maybe we can go to ice cream place near cinema.
Yes, that is right. I look forward to it.
Sure, see you then. Bye, Mei!
