Oh, hello! This one is very nice. Um, how to say... one hundred dollars.
Um, I can... give you special price. Ninety dollars, okay?
Seventy-five? That is... very low. But, okay, I can do eighty dollars. Is that fine?
Um, seventy-eight... that is okay. But... how to say... I need to make little profit.
Seventy-seven... okay, I agree. You good customer.
No problem. I will wrap it for you. Wait a moment, okay?
Here you go! It is all wrapped up. Enjoy your new vase.
You too! Bye-bye!
