Hi, Mei! I am good, thanks. How about you?
Um, I think... maybe end of this month? But, you know, we have a lot of things to do, so maybe a little bit later, like... next week?
I am working on the... um, report. And also, I need to check the data, you know, make sure everything is correct.
No, no, I can do it. But, if it is really hard, I will ask for help. Thank you, Mei.
Um, how about Wednesday? Or Thursday is okay too.
2 p.m. Sounds good. I will... um, prepare some notes to bring.
Yes, I will do that. I think it is important to keep everything organized.
No, I donâ€™t think so. I just have the report and data to finish. But, if something comes up, I will let you know.
Yes, I hope so. Thank you, Mei.
See you then. Goodbye, Mei.
