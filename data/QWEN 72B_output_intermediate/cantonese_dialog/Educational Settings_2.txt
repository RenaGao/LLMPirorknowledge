I am good, thank you. You?
Yes, I have time. You want do what?
Oh, climate change, yes. That is difficult topic. Good idea. Where we meet?
Library is good. What time we meet?
Three p.m., okay. But, um, how to say... that quite late for me. Can we meet earlier?
One p.m., that is better. We need bring what?
Good, I bring my notes. Um, how to explain... I have some idea, but not sure if right.
Yes, thank you. I feel more comfortable now.
Yes, 1 p.m., library. See you then.
You too, thank you!
