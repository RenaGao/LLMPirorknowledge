Ah, hello! I am okay, thank you. The assignment, um, I have problem with it. Can you help me, please?
The part about, um, the essay. I not sure how to start it. And also, I no understand the question fully.
Sure. The question is: "Discuss the impact of social media on young peopleâ€™s mental health." I no sure what to write about the impact.
I think, um, both. Some people say it help, but also, it can make people feel bad.
Yes, that make sense. I can write about that. But, um, how to structure the essay?
Ah, I see. So, in introduction, I say what I will talk about. In body, I give examples and explain. In conclusion, I summarize everything. Is that right?
Yes, I will do that. Thank you so much for your help, really!
Thank you! I will try my best. See you next time!
