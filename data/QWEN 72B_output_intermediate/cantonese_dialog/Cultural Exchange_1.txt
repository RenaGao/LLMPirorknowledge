Hey, I’m good, thank you. And you?
Um, yes, a bit. I think it very different. In Hong Kong, we have many rules, like no putting chopsticks in the middle of the bowl.
Yes, it is. And also, we don’t tap the bowl with chopsticks. It like begging.
Elbows off table? Why?
In Hong Kong, we wait too. But sometimes, if host say you can eat, you can start.
Yes, in Japan, it show you enjoy the food. But in Hong Kong, we try to be quiet.
Yes, I understand. Um, how to say... it can be tricky when you visit new place.
Yes, I agree. Learning new things always good.
Um, I think in some Middle Eastern countries, they eat with right hand. It very different from using utensils.
Yes, it really does. We learn a lot from each other.
You’re welcome! Same here. Talk to you again soon, okay?
Bye! Take care!
