Hey, Mei, I am good, thanks. Um, I think I want to organize a Cantonese food festival. How to say... a gathering where people can try different Cantonese dishes and learn about our culture.
Um, I want to have... dim sum, of course. And, uh, roast goose, and... how to say... that special rice with sausage and chicken?
Yes, yes! Congee with lap cheong and chicken. And maybe some desserts like egg tarts and mango pudding.
Oh, I think we can have some traditional lion dance performances. And, um, maybe some Cantonese opera singers. Also, we can set up a stall where people can learn to write Chinese calligraphy.
I was thinking maybe the community center downtown. It is big enough for all the stalls and performances.
Um, I think next month, in November, would be good. It is not too cold, and people are free from holidays.
Yes, I need volunteers for cooking, setting up stalls, and helping with the performances. I will post on social media to find more people.
Thank you so much, Mei! You are very kind.
Sure, how about Wednesday? We can meet at my place.
See you Wednesday! Thank you again. Bye!
