Hey, Mei! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Um, I think I am not ready yet. I still have many things need to study.
I focus on math and science. Math is very hard for me. I don’t understand some of the formula.
Yes, that would be good! I think if we study together, I can understand better.
I am free on Wednesday and Friday. Wednesday is better for me.
How about four o’clock in the library?
Yes, practice problems help a lot. I will bring my notes.
Okay, thank you! I will do that. See you on Wednesday!
Thanks, Mei! You too! Bye!
