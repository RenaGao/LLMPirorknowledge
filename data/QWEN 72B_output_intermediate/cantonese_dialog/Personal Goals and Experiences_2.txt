Hi Mei, I good. How about you?
Um, yes. I finish... um, I complete my first marathon.
It take me four hour and twenty minute. It very hard, but I happy finish.
I want to be healthy and strong. And, um, I like challenge. Running marathon is big challenge for me.
I train every day. I run early morning, and I also do... um, how to say... strength training?
The hardest part is... um, around thirty kilometer. I very tired, but I keep going. I think about my family, they support me so much.
I feel so happy and proud. I think, I do it! I finish marathon. It very special moment for me.
This achievement show me I can do hard thing. It give me confidence. I think I can do more in future.
Next goal is... um, I want to improve my English. I practice more, and maybe take exam.
Thank you, Mei. Nice to talk with you too. See you next time.
