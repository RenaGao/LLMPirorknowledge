Ah, yes, hello! I am good, thank you. I still very excited. How are you?
My favorite meal is... um, congee. You know congee? It is like very thin rice soup. My mother often make for me when I sick.
Yes, sure! First, I need to soak rice for about... um, half hour. Then, I put rice in pot with a lot of water and boil it. After that, I turn heat to low and simmer for maybe one hour.
I add some... um, ginger and scallions. Sometimes, I put in some chicken or pork. It make congee more tasty. And I also add a little salt and pepper.
Yes, I think important to stir congee often while it cook. This help rice break down and make congee more smooth. And I always check water level, make sure it not dry out.
Yes, I think Sunday good. What time we start?
10 a.m. sound good to me. I will bring some ingredients from my place.
Thank you too! See you Sunday morning!
