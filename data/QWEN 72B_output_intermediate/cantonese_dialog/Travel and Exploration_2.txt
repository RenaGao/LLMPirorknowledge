Ah, yes, of course! I can help you. The historical museum is... um... near the main square. You go this way, turn left, and then go straight for about five minutes. You will see big building with old style.
No, it is very big. You cannot miss it. Um, how to say... it is landmark of the town. Many people go there.
Yes, there is park nearby. It is very nice, have many trees and flowers. Um... and also, there is old church, very beautiful. You should see.
Yes, it is. You go out from the museum, turn right, and walk for about three minutes. You will see big green area.
Church is near park, but not inside. You go from park, turn left, and walk for another five minutes. You will see big, old building with tower.
You are welcome! I hope you enjoy your visit. If you need more help, just ask. I am happy to help.
You too! See you around. Bye-bye!
