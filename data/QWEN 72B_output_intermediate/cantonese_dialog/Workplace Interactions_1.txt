Ah, not too much. I know a little bit, but I need more detail. How to start?
Yes, I think so. It is... um, in the company folder, right?
Um, I think... is to name the folder. Use the project name, no?
Okay, I get it. And then?
Yes, I understand. Documents, Images, and Code. And then, we put the files in these folders?
Um, how to say... sharing settings. It is in the... right-click menu, no?
Got it. And the last step?
Okay, I see. Project goals, timeline, and milestones. I will write it down.
No, I think I understand. It sounds good. Thank you for explaining.
Thanks, you too. Goodbye!
