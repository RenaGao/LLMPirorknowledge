Hey, Sarah! Ah, how to say... I have a bit nervous. Test is important, you know.
Um, I start a little bit. I read textbook and make some notes. But I think I need more help.
Ah, the hardest part is... um, the problem-solving questions. I always... how to say... stuck.
Yes, I think it very good idea. We can meet before test, like tomorrow?
Um, I finish class at 4 p.m. So, 5 p.m. is good, I think.
How about the library? It is quiet and have many study room.
Yes, I think... um, the chapter about functions and graphs. And also, some practice exams.
Thank you so much, Sarah. I really appreciate your help.
Yes, see you then! Thank you again. Bye!
