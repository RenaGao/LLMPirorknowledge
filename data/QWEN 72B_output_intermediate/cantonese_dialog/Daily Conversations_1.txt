Hi Mei, I am good, thank you. Um, how to say... no plan yet. What about you?
Beach? Sound good! I like beach. We can do what?
Yes, very fun! I just buy new swimsuit. Um, perfect for beach.
Uh, ten o'clock? Too early?
Okay, ten o'clock, very good. Where we meet?
Yes, very okay. I know place. I go there before.
Yes, I bring some fruit and water. Anything else need?
Yes, very good idea. I will bring towel and sunscreen.
Me too! See you Saturday!
