Hey Mei, I am fine, thank you. How you are?
Yes, I want learn... um, how to say... uh, cooking.
Because... um, I like food. And I want make nice meal for my family. Also, I think it is healthy and save money.
I want learn Cantonese food. Like... um, congee, dim sum, and maybe uh, stir-fry.
Yes, I try make congee before. But it no good. I need practice more.
Yes, I think I will watch some videos on YouTube. And maybe find class in community center.
Um, I like Jamie... Jamie... Jamie Oliver. He have good videos, and he explain clear.
I think I will try stir-fry first. It look not too difficult.
Yes, I have most ingredients. I need buy some vegetable and sauce.
Thank you, Mei. I will try my best. Maybe I can cook for you one day.
Yes, next weekend is good. See you then.
You too, Mei! Bye!
