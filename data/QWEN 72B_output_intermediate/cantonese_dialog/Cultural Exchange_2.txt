Hey Mei, I am good, thank you. You?
Um, my favorite... favorite holiday is Chun Yeung Festival, you know, the Tomb Sweeping Day.
Yes, it is... um, when people go to... how to say... cemetery to clean the tomb and pay respect to ancestor.
Yes, I go with my family. We bring food, like fruit and paper money to burn. It is very important for us.
Um, we bring fruit, like apples and oranges, and also some... some meat, like chicken. And, um, we bring incense to burn.
Yes, I remember when I was small, my grandparents tell me stories about our ancestors. It is very... very touching.
Yes, we also celebrate Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival. Chinese New Year is very big, we have a lot of food and visit relatives.
Um, I look forward to the... the dinner, the reunion dinner. We have a big meal with all the family. And, um, the fireworks are very beautiful.
Yes, it is very fun. I am very happy to share with you.
Thank you, Mei. You too, bye!
