Ah, hi Mei. I am good, thank you. How you are?
Yes, I think good. When you wanna do it?
Ten a.m. sound okay, but maybe a bit early. Um, how to say... People might still be... um, not fully awake.
Eleven a.m. is better. Yes, that is good.
Um, we can talk about project progress, and also some... um, team building things.
Yes, that important. And maybe, um, review... review the tasks?
Good idea. I think this cover everything.
Yes, that all sound good. We can send out meeting invite?
No problem, thank you, Mei. See you at the meeting!
