Hi! I am good, thanks. Yes, I want to join. What we do for party?
Um, how to say... We can have some games, like, um... charades, and also music. And... decorations, we can use balloons and streamers.
Yes, I like, um... spin the bottle, and also, truth or dare. These fun games.
I can bring, um... some snacks, like chips and popcorn. And maybe we can make some, um... finger food, like sandwiches.
We can start early, maybe, um... three o'clock. That way, everything ready before Jason come.
Yes, I can, um... tell Jason we go to cinema, but we actually come to your place. He will be surprised!
Yeah, we text each other. I think it will be really fun surprise for Jason.
Yes, see you then. Bye!
