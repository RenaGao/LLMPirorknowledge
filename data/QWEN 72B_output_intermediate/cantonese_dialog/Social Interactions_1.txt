Ah, I am good, thank you. Yes, I think... um, we can do something fun for Mei.
Um, we can go to the beach. She like beach... um, how to say... it is relaxing for her.
We can swim, and also, um... sit in the sun. Maybe we can have a picnic too.
Um, some sandwiches, fruits, and also, um... drinks. Maybe some cake too, because it is birthday.
Yes, that is good. We can also, um... make a banner. It say "Happy Birthday Mei."
Um, how about... ten o'clock? It is not too early, but we have enough time to prepare.
We can meet at the... um, how to say... bus stop near the beach.
We need... um, towel, sunscreen, and also, um... beach umbrella. Maybe some games too.
Yes, yes! Beach ball is good. It is fun to play.
Yes, I can do that. I will send message to everyone. Um, what to say?
Okay, I will write that. Thank you for help.
Yes, see you Saturday! Thank you!
