Hey Mei, I am good, thank you. What you mean plans?
Oh, I see. No, not really. Why you ask?
Picnic? Um, how to say... that sound good! Where you think we should go?
Yes, I know that park. It have nice place for picnic. What we need to bring?
Sandwiches good. I like... um, tomato and cheese. And maybe some chips?
Yes, water and juice good. We should bring also some... um, plates and napkins?
Meet at the park, um, ten oâ€™clock? Or too early?
Yes, cool morning good. I will tell my family.
See you there! Thank you, Mei. Bye!
