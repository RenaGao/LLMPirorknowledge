Oh, hey Mei, I fine. How about you?
Um, I have bit problem. The, um... how to say... the assignment?
The part about, um, the graphs. I not understand how to, um, make them.
Maybe we can ask teacher. I think he can explain better.
Yes, but, um, when is his office hour?
Um, 2 PM is good. I will go then.
Yes, that good. We can walk together.
How about 1:45? That give us time to, um, get there early.
