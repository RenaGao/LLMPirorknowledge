Hello, Alex. I have... have a problem with a thing I buy. Um, how to say... a electronic device.
Um, it is... a, a Bluetooth speaker. I buy it last week. But... it, it not work properly.
Yes. When I connect my phone, it... um, it not play music. I try many time, but no sound.
Yes, I check. Battery is full. I even try with new... um, new batteries, but still no sound.
Um, I look, but I not find anything helpful. It just say to connect and play, but it not work.
Hold the power button? Okay, I try. (Pause) I try, but it still not work.
Ah, I see. I try with my tablet... (Pause) No, it still not work.
Yes, my order number is... um, 123456789. And the model... it is... BASS-BLAST 2000.
No, I think that is all. Thank you very much for your help, Alex.
Thank you. You too. Bye!
