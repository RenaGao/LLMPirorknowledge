Hey Mei, I am good. Um... my morning... I wake up... um, seven o'clock. Yes, seven o'clock. How about you?
I... um, brush tooth and shower. Then, I make breakfast. I like to eat... um, porridge. Porridge is good for me.
I make congee. You know, the Chinese porridge. I put some, um... vegetables and egg. It is, how to say... nutritious.
Yes, I do. I go for a walk... um, around my neighborhood. It is... um, refreshing. I feel good after.
Yoga is good. I try it once. It is... um, how to say... challenging but relaxing.
I usually, um... leave at, um, nine o'clock. I work from home now, so I start work at... um, nine thirty.
Yes, I read the news and check emails. I like to stay informed. And, um, I make a to-do list. It helps me organize my day.
I like the, um, quiet time. It is... um, peaceful. I feel, um, more focused and ready for the day.
Yes, we should. Thank you, Mei. Take care!
