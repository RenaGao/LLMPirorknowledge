Ah, I am good, thank you. How you are?
Yes, um, I think is good idea. In Cantonese, we have many, many rules for eating.
Sure. First, we not use chopsticks... um, like point people, or cross them. This very rude.
In Cantonese, we try not to make noise. But, uh, slurping noodles little bit okay. It show food is good.
Yes, in Chinese, oldest or most important person sit at head of table. Also, guest of honor sit to right of host.
Um, yes. We always say "請" (ching3) before meal. Is like "please" in English. And after meal, we say "多謝" (dou6 se6), thank you.
In Chinese, we usually use chopsticks or spoon, not hands. Only for some food, like dumplings, we use hands. But we clean hands first.
Yes, very important to be clean. Also, in Chinese, we not take last piece of food from plate. Is show we not want more, and host give more if last piece gone.
Yes, is same idea, but different way. Um, one more thing, we not pour tea for ourselves. Always pour for others first, then self.
Yes, I think this show respect. How about you, Mei, you have any other rules?
Oh, I see. It is like we have different chopstick for different food. Interesting!
Yes, is fun to learn. Thank you, Mei. We talk more next time?
Bye, Mei. See you soon!
