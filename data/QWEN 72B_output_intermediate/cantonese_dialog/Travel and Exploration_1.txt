Hi, um, yes. My favorite place is... um, how to say... 銅鑼灣 (Tung Lo Wan). It is in Hong Kong.
No, it is Tung Lo Wan. It have many shops and restaurants. I like go there with my friends and family.
We go shopping, and we eat food. The food there is very good. We also go to the cinema. Sometimes, we just walk around and look at the people.
I like eating dim sum. The dim sum in Tung Lo Wan is very yummy. We go to this one restaurant, and they have the best 蝦餃 (har gow).
Yes, I also like the 蒸餃 (zheng jiao) and the 叉燒包 (char siu bao). The 叉燒包 is very soft and sweet.
Yes, I go there almost every weekend. It is a good place to relax and spend time with people.
Yes, I remember one time we had a big family gathering there. We all went to a restaurant and had a big meal. It was very happy.
Yes, it is. Tung Lo Wan is a very special place to me.
Thank you too. I enjoy talking with you. See you next time.
Bye!
