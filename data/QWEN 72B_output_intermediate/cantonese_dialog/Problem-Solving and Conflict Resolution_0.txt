Oh, I am... um, good. Thanks. And you?
Yes, of course. What is it?
Oh, I... I am sorry. I no mean to, um... exclude you. I just think, um, Wing and I, we plan it suddenly.
Yes, of course, we are good friends. I should have asked you. I feel bad.
Next weekend? How to say... maybe we can go hiking? I like hiking, and it is good exercise.
Yes, good idea. I will ask him. And also, um, we can have picnic, you know, bring some food and drinks.
Um, how about Sunday? I think Sunday is better, because I have work on Saturday.
Let’s say, um, ten o’clock? Nine is too early, I think.
Yes, I agree. I will, um, text Wing and confirm with him.
No problem, thank you too. I am glad we fix this. See you Sunday!
You too, bye!
