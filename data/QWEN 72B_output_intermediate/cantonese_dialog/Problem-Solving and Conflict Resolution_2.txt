Ah, hi Mei! I am good, thank you. How you are?
Yes, the project. I think we need to... um, how to say... organize our tasks better.
First, um, we need to finish the market research, right? That is important.
OK, um, how about... next Friday? Is that too soon?
Yes, that is good idea. I can work on... um, the data analysis part. You can... um, do the report writing?
Yes, we can have meeting... um, every week, maybe?
10 a.m. is good. Um, Monday morning is not too busy for me.
Yes, I can create Google Doc. That is easy for both of us.
Yes, everything is clear. I will send you the link for the document later today.
Yes, I think we are. Thanks for your help, Mei.
You too! See you on Monday!
