Hey Mei, I good, thanks. Yes, I free. What you want to talk about?
Um, greenhouse effect... I know it important, but how to say... not very clear. Can you explain more?
Ah, I see. So, these gases make the Earth warm, like a blanket. But too much can cause problem, right?
Okay, I understand. We need to write about this for our project?
Right, burning things make more gases. How to say... factories, cars, and power plants.
Good idea. We can say wind, solar power, and also reforestation.
Yes, I can find some data online. Um, how to... make sure it reliable?
Okay, I will check. We can meet again next week to go over the draft?
Wednesday is fine. I will see you then. Thanks, Mei!
Bye, Mei! Take care!
