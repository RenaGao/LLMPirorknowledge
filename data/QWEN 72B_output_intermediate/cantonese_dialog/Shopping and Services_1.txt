Ah, yes. I can help you. What type of phone you like? Android or iPhone?
iPhone is... um, it is very good for app store and... um, how to say... user interface. Android have more choice for brand and model.
For battery, um, Android usually better. iPhone camera is very good, but now many Android phone also have good camera.
Yes, for iPhone, iPhone 13 is popular. For Android, um, Samsung Galaxy S21 is good. And also, there is... um, Xiaomi, it is cheap and good.
Xiaomi is good. Many people say it is... um, strong and good for price. But iPhone and Samsung, they have better brand, so more trust.
For customer support, um, iPhone is very good. They have many store and service. Samsung also have good support, but Xiaomi... um, not so much in some place.
I use... um, I use Samsung. It is good for me. Very smooth and camera take good photo.
Yes, I think so. You can try it, and if you like, buy it.
