Hey Mei! I am good, thank you. Yes, I am free. What you want do?
Um... how to say... the beach? I hear the weather is very good now.
Oh, I like swim and sunbathe. We also can eat some... um... snacks?
Ten o'clock is good, I think. Too early, we will be... um... very tired.
Yes, very good. I just buy new swimsuit. It is very... um... nice.
Bring sunscreen, towel, and... um... water bottle. And maybe some... um... games?
Yes, frisbee is fun. Volleyball is good too. We all like play.
Yes, I remember. See you then! Thank you for invite me.
Bye! See you!
