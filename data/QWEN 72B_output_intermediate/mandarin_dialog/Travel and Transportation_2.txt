Hi! I am good, thank you. Group vacation? Sounds fun! You have idea for place?
Beach is good! But... um, how to say... I prefer mountains. Maybe we can go to a place with mountains? It is more peaceful.
Oh, that sounds perfect! We can swim and also hike. What place you have in mind?
Cape Cod? I know that place. It is famous for beach and nature. Yes, I like it.
Next month is good for me. But... um, can we check with others? Maybe they have different plan.
We can go swimming, hiking, and maybe have a picnic. Oh, and take pictures! I like taking pictures.
Yes, I love seafood. That will be great.
Sounds perfect! Thank you for organizing this.
Yes, definitely. Talk to you later! Goodbye!
