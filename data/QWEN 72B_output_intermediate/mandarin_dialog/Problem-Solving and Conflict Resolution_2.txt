Hi, I am good, thank you. You?
Yes, I look at it. It is... how to say... it is very tight. We need work hard.
Good idea. We can... um... make plan. First, we divide tasks.
I can do... um... research and data collection. I am good at finding information.
Sounds good. We can meet every day, talk about progress.
Yes, that is good. We also need contingency plan, in case something goes wrong.
Um... technical issues, like software not working, or data not available. Also, team member might get sick.
Yes, I think so. We have clear plan now.
No problem! I think we can do it. See you tomorrow for the first check-in.
