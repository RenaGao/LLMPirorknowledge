Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. It is nice to meet you. How are you?
Oh, my favorite meal is Kung Pao chicken. It is very yummy. I can show you how to make it.
Um, we need chicken, of course. And also, peanuts, and vegetables like bell peppers and onions. We also need, um, chili peppers for the spicy part.
Yes, the sauce is important. We need soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and a little bit of, um, how to say... starch? Yes, starch to make it thick.
First, we cut the chicken into small pieces and marinate it with soy sauce and a little bit of wine. Then, we fry the peanuts and set them aside. Next, we, um... stir-fry the chicken with the vegetables and chili peppers. Finally, we add the sauce and mix everything together.
It is not too long. Maybe 20 or 30 minutes. The most important part is to stir-fry quickly over high heat.
We can serve it with rice. Some people like to add a bit of, um, green onion on top for flavor.
How about this Saturday? We can buy the ingredients together.
Great! See you on Saturday. It will be fun.
You too! Bye!
