Yes, I have trouble sleep. And I don’t feel hungry. I only drink water.
Yes, very tired. I can’t do… um, my work or… um, anything.
Yes, I take some… um, headache… headache medicine. But it doesn’t help much.
Okay, thank you. I… um, I hope it’s nothing serious.
Yes, that’s fine. I’ll do… um, what you say.
Thank you, doctor. I feel better knowing… um, you’ll help me.
Goodbye, doctor. See you later.
