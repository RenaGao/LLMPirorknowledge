**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin)**: Hi, yes, I am free. How about you?
**Speaker B**: Um, I start, but I not finish yet. I have some trouble with the layout. How to say... the design is not... not easy.
**Speaker B**: Yes, I think so. Maybe you can show me some examples of good layout?
**Speaker B**: Ah, yes, I start data collection. I have some data, but I need more. I plan to finish it by Wednesday.
**Speaker B**: Yes, I will check it carefully. I also think we need to talk about the report. When we start writing it?
**Speaker B**: That work for me. I can write the introduction and the methods section.
**Speaker B**: Yes, that is good plan. I will send you my part by Thursday.
**Speaker B**: Thank you. I will work hard to finish my part. See you next week.
**Speaker B**: Bye! Have a good weekend too!
