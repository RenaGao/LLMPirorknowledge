Hi, Xiao Ming! I am good, thanks. Um... how to say... I think we can talk about... the quantum mechanics part. It is... very hard to understand.
Well, the wave-particle duality. I do not understand... how something can be both a wave and a particle at the same time. It is so... confusing.
Ah, I see. But... um... how to measure it? When we measure, it only shows one form, right?
Uncertainty principle... okay, I think I get it a little bit more now. But, um... how does this apply to real-life things?
Wow, that is amazing! Um... do you think we can practice some problems related to this?
Yes, I have one from the textbook. It is about... calculating the probability of a particle being in a certain position. Can you help me with that?
Um... yes, I think so. It is the square of the wave function, right? |ψ(x)|²?
Okay, let’s do it. I will try my best to follow.
It is... um... ψ(x) = A sin(kx), where A and k are constants.
We need to normalize the wave function, right? So, we have to find A.
Okay, I will try to do the integral. Um... let me see... one moment.
I think... I got it. The integral is... um... A² times the integral of sin²(kx) from 0 to L, where L is the length of the box. And the result is... A²L/2 = 1. So, A = √(2/L).
Yes, thank you so much! I understand it much better now.
Yes, I agree. We can practice more later. Thanks again, Xiao Ming.
Thanks! You too! Goodbye!
