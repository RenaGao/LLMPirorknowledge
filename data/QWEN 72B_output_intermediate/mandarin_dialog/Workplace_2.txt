Hello, thanks! Yes, I started on Monday. Nice to meet you, Jamie.
Um, not really. But I... I learn fast. What... what is the main goal of this report?
Oh, I see. So, we need to... um, collect data and then... how to say... analyze it?
Sounds good. Where do we get the data from?
That’s helpful. And after we get the data, what do we do next?
I understand. So, we use Excel to make the charts?
No, I know a little. But it’s good to have a refresher. Thanks!
I think... I can start tomorrow. Is that okay?
Yes, I will try my best. Should I send you the draft before the meeting?
Okay, no problem. Thanks for your help, Jamie.
You too! See you tomorrow.
