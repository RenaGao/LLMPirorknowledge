Sure, thank you. I have time. Can you tell me, um, how to start a new project?
Ah, yes, I used it a little. But I forget some... how to say... some parts.
Oh, I see. Then what I do?
Okay, I got it. And then?
I understand. And what about, um, the tasks?
Yes, I see. So, I create task, and then assign to team member?
Got it. And, um, how to check progress?
Okay, I will try it. Thank you for explaining.
Sure, I will. Thanks again. Have a good day!
