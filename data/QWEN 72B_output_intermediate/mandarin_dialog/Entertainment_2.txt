Hey! I’m good, thank you. I been... um, reading a lot. And you?
Yes, I read a book called *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari. It is very interesting. Maybe you read it before?
It is about human history, you know, from the beginning to now. Explain how we become so... um, powerful and... how to say... influence the world.
I like how the author explain big idea in simple way. And also, it make me think about future, what we can do to make world better.
Um, yes! I also read *The Little Prince* by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It is a classic, very famous. It is... um, story about friendship and love, and also... how to say... meaning of life.
I think it is good because it is... um, easy to understand, but also very deep. The story is simple, but the message is very... um, strong. It make you think about important things in life.
No problem! I hope you like it. We can talk about it when you finish reading.
You welcome! Have a good day! See you next time!
