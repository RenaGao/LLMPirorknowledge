Hello, I am... um, fine. Thank you. How are you?
Sure. My name is Xiao Li. I am from Beijing. I, uh, study business... business administration in university.
I am in my third year. I will graduate next year.
I... um, like marketing. I think it is very interesting. Also, I want to... how to say... improve my communication skills and work with different people.
Yes, I... um, I did a project in my marketing class. We had to create a campaign for a new product. I was responsible for... um, market research.
We focused on... um, young people, like teenagers. We made a video to show how the product can help them in their daily life.
We... um, sent out surveys to our target audience. We got very good feedback. They thought the video was useful and the product looked interesting.
I am good at... um, analyzing data. I can find important information quickly. Also, I am a team player. I like working with others to achieve goals.
One challenge was working with a team member who did not contribute much. I, um, talked to him and suggested we divide the work more fairly. It helped a lot.
I want to gain more experience in marketing. I also want to... um, learn more about digital marketing and social media strategies.
Yes, um, what is the team like? And, uh, what are the opportunities for growth in this role?
That sounds good. Thank you for telling me.
Thank you! I hope to hear from you. Bye bye!
