Hi! Yes, I am. Xiao Liâ€™s birthday is coming up soon. She really like surprises. Um... how to say... it will be a nice thing to make her happy.
I want to do it at my place. It is big enough for everyone. We can play games and eat some good food. Maybe... um, we can have a cake and some snacks.
Yes, I think next Saturday will be good. Everyone can come. It is a weekend, so no one has work.
I will invite our close friends from school and work. Maybe about... um, ten people. I will send them a message later to confirm.
Yes, I need to buy some balloons and streamers. I also want to make some posters. You can help me with that, right?
How about... um, three o'clock? That should give us enough time to finish.
Yes, I will pick some songs that Xiao Li likes. She loves pop music and some oldies.
I think I will buy one. I am not a good baker. But I will make some cookies and other snacks.
Um... we should also think about some party games. I will look some up online and send you the list. We can decide together.
Yes, see you then! Thanks for helping me. It means a lot.
You too! Bye!
