Hi, I am good. How are you?
Oh, I see. That’s okay. No problem. Um, how to say... I can adjust my time.
No worries. It's not a big deal. I just need to wake up a little earlier.
Hmm, maybe... can we meet at the park entrance at 9:45 a.m.? That way, I have some extra time to get ready.
You are welcome. It’s fine. I am happy to meet you.
Sure, no problem. I will text you if I have any questions.
You too! See you then. Bye!
