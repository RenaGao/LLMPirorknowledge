Oh, hi! No problem. I know we need to talk. I feel... um, a little bit confused.
Yes, I know. But sometimes, um, I feel like you push me too hard. It make me uncomfortable.
Thatâ€™s good to hear. I also sorry. I think I overreact a little bit.
Yes, I agree. Um, maybe we can find activities that both of us like.
Hiking sounds good! And painting too, but I not very good at painting.
Yes, I like that. It will be fun.
Sure, that works for me. What time we meet?
9 a.m. sounds good. I will be there.
Me too. See you next weekend!
