Oh, hi Xiao Ming! It was very good! I, um, I go there with my family. New York, it is very big city, you know?
We, um, we visit many places. We, we go to Statue of Liberty, and uh, Central Park. Also, we, uh, go to Times Square. It is very, very crowded!
My favorite part, um, how to say... it is, I think, the food. New York has very good food. We eat many kinds of food, like pizza, um, and bagels. And also, we try Chinese food in Chinatown.
Yes, we try, um, what is it called... dim sum. It is very tasty. And uh, we also try, um, ah, cheesecake. It is very delicious!
Yes, we, we go to, um, a museum. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is very big, and we see many paintings and old things.
Yes, we buy some, um, small things for my friends. Also, I buy a, um, T-shirt with New York logo. It is very nice.
The weather, it is, um, a little cold, but sunny. We, we wear jackets, but it is comfortable to walk around.
Um, yes, sometimes we get lost, but we, we use map on phone, and it help us find way back. Also, the subway is very, very busy.
Yes, we take many pictures. I, I want to show them to my friends and family. It is, um, very good memory.
Yes, that would be great! We can go to another city, um, maybe San Francisco or, um, Los Angeles.
Thanks, you too! Goodbye, Xiao Ming!
