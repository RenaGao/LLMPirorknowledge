Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Um, yes, I have some idea. First, you can try restart router, maybe?
How to say... you can check if other devices also have same problem. Maybe is problem with your computer, not the router.
You can try call your internet provider, ask for help. They have tech support.
Yes, can be. But sometimes they can fix problem quickly. Also, you can try check online for solutions. Sometimes people post helpful tips on forums.
Um, you can try... how to say... Google "internet troubleshooting" and see what come up. Also, Reddit have good community help.
No problem! Hope it help. If you still have problem, let me know. Maybe I can help more.
You are welcome. Good luck with your internet! Bye!
