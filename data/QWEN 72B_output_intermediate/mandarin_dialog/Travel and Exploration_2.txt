Hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, I know! Park... um, how to say... gōng yuán, is very nice here. It close to the city center. You want to go there?
Sure! First, you need to walk down this street until you see the big intersection. There have a big sign, you can’t miss it.
Turn right at the big sign. After you turn, you will walk for about five minute. Then, you see a small bridge.
Cross the bridge, and the park will be on your left side. It very big and have many trees.
Yes, it very nice! You can ride bike, have picnic, or just relax. Many people go there, especially in good weather.
Hm, there is a bike rental place near the park entrance. You can find it easy. They have many nice bikes.
They open at 9 o’clock in the morning. You can go there any time after that.
Yes, 10 o’clock is very good. The weather is nice at that time.
Yes, they accept credit card. But also, you can pay with cash if you prefer.
No problem! I hope you have fun at the park. If you need more help, you can call me.
You welcome! Have good day!
Bye-bye!
