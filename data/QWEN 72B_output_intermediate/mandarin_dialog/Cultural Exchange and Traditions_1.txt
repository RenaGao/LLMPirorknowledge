Hi, I am good, thank you. Yes, it was very nice. Um... how to say... We had lots of food and family. It was very big dinner.
We had, um, dumplings, hot pot, and some fish. In China, fish is very important for New Year. It means, um... how to say... prosperity.
Yes, in China, we have many rules for eating. For example, we should not point chopsticks at people. It is, um... how to say... rude. Also, we should not stick chopsticks in the rice. It looks like, um... how to say... a grave.
Yes, we also should wait for the oldest person to start eating first. It shows respect. And, um, we should not finish all the food on the plate. It means there is, um... how to say... enough food.
Yes, it is very different. Um, in the U.S., do you have any special rules for eating?
Oh, I see. So, it is important to, um, how to say... pay attention to the table manners.
Yes, I have been to some American restaurants. It was, um, a bit different, but very fun. I learned a lot.
You are welcome! It was nice to talk with you. Um, how to say... see you later!
