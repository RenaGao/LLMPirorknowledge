Hi, Xiao Ming! I am fine, thank you. Yes, of course! Um, one festival that is very important to me is... how to say... Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year.
It is special because it is big family reunion time. Everyone try to go home and be with family. We have big dinner, um, with lots of food, and um, special dishes.
We eat, um, dumplings, fish, and um, niangao, which is sticky rice cake. Fish is very important because it means "surplus" in Chinese, so we hope for good fortune in the new year.
Yes, we have, um, um, how to say... red envelope, give money to children for good luck. And we set off firecrackers, watch dragon and lion dances. Also, we, um, clean the house before the new year to, um, sweep away bad luck.
My favorite part is, um, family time. I love being with my family, eating delicious food, and watching the fireworks. It is very, very happy time.
Yes, we, um, decorate our house with, um, red decorations, put up, um, couplets, and, um, lanterns. And we, um, visit relatives and friends to wish them a happy new year.
You are welcome! I am happy to share. Maybe one day you can come to China and experience it yourself!
No problem! Talk to you soon, Xiao Ming! Bye!
