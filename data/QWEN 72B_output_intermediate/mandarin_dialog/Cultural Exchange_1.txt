Hi! I am good, thank you. Yes, we plan to have dinner this weekend. Maybe we try Italian food.
Hmm, I think there is one near the park. It is called... um, how to say... "Trattoria Bella." Yes, Trattoria Bella.
No, I never go there. But I hear it is very good. You been there?
I like pasta. Maybe we can try spaghetti... um, spaghetti Carbonara. And also, um... salad.
Yes, definitely. In China, we often share dishes. Everyone put food on the same table and eat from it. But here, everyone orders their own meal.
Yes, I miss it. It feel more... um, how to say... more connected with people. But I like trying new things too. What about you?
Yes, one time I... um, how to say... I use the wrong fork. In China, we usually use chopsticks or a spoon, not many forks.
Yes, sure. When you use chopsticks, do not point at people. And, um, do not stick them in your rice. It is not polite.
Yes, it is very interesting. I think we can learn a lot from each other.
Me too! See you then. Bye!
