Hi! Yes, I am good. Thank you for asking. Um, my goal is... I want to learn more about... um, how to say... photography. And also, I want to travel to different places.
For photography, I want to take class. Like, um, online class. And also, practice more. For travel, I am saving money. I hope to visit... um, how to say... famous cities in China and maybe other countries too.
Yes! I want to go to Xi'an. It is famous for the terracotta warriors. And also, maybe Shanghai. It is big city and very modern. For other countries, I want to see... um, Paris. It is the city of love, right?
I like... um, landscape and street photography. I think it is very interesting to capture the beauty of nature and the life of people in the city.
I want to practice at least once a week. Maybe more if I can find time. And I will carry my camera everywhere I go, so I can take picture whenever I see something nice.
I use my phone camera now. But I hope to buy a DSLR camera soon. I think it will help me take better pictures.
I want to learn about post-processing. Like, how to edit pictures to make them look better. And also, maybe learn some new languages. I think it will help me when I travel.
Yes, I want to learn English better. And maybe a little bit of French. It will help me when I travel to Paris.
I feel very excited! It is a lot, but I think I can do it. I will work hard and stay focused.
Thank you! I will try my best. See you next time!
