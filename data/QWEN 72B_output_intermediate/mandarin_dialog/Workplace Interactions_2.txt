Hi! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Tomorrow afternoon? Um, that sounds good. What time?
Three p.m. Okay, I can do that. What we need to discuss?
Um, yes. I think... we should talk about the budget. And maybe... how to say... resource allocation?
No, I think that is all. Um, how long the meeting will be?
One hour, okay. I will prepare some notes. Where is the meeting?
Yes, conference room is fine. I will be there on time.
Thank you. I look forward to it. See you tomorrow.
You too! Bye!
