Hi! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Ah, yes. I not feeling so good last week. But now, I feel much better. Thank you for ask.
Um, I want to... how to say... take care of myself better. Maybe exercise more and eat good food.
I like to go for walk and sometimes run. But I not run very much because I get tired quickly.
Yes, I want to eat more vegetable and fruit. I know they good for health. But sometimes I forget.
Yes, good idea! I can make some vegetable sticks and bring to work. Also, I want to drink more water.
Yes, I try to meditate sometimes. And I also like to read book to relax.
Um, I also want to sleep more. I usually stay up late, but I know it not good for health.
Yes, I can try that. I think it help me sleep better.
Yes, that would be great! I will let you know how it go.
Thank you! Bye-bye!
