Hi! I am good, thank you. And you?
Oh, I watch some movies and TV shows. I like watch... um, relaxing things.
My favorite movie is... um, how to say... "In the Mood for Love." It is very beautiful and... um, romantic.
For TV shows, I really like "Stranger Things." It is very exciting and... um, mysterious.
I like the characters and the... um, how to say... the story is very interesting. And the music is good too.
Yes, I also like "Friends." It is very funny and... um, make me laugh a lot.
I think the... um, how to say... the jokes and the relationship between the characters. They are very close and funny together.
Yes, I start watching "The Crown." It is about the... um, British royal family.
I like it very much. It is very... um, how to say... informative and shows the history clearly.
Yes, I want to watch "Breaking Bad." Many people tell me it is very good.
I am excited to see it. Maybe we can watch it together sometime?
Thank you! It was nice talking with you. See you soon!
