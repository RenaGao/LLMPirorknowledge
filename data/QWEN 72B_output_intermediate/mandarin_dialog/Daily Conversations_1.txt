Hi! Um, I am good. How to say... free this weekend. Do you have plans?
Oh, that sounds good! I like park. What we can do there?
Yes, very good ideas! Um... how to say... rent bikes? Where can we rent them?
Ah, I see. So, um... when we meet?
10 a.m. Saturday. That is good time. No problem!
Yes, I will remember. Thanks for reminding me. See you this weekend!
You too! Bye!
