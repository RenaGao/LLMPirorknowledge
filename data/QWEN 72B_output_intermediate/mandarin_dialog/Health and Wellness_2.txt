Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Yes, I want to... um, how to say... be more healthy and strong. And maybe lose some weight.
Yes, I try running and sometimes... uh, doing push-ups and sit-ups at home.
I try to exercise three times a week, but sometimes... um, I am busy and can only do it two times.
I think morning is best for me. I can wake up early and do some exercise before work.
I like running and cycling. Um, I also enjoy yoga, but I am not very good at it yet.
Not really. I am a little scared of hurting myself.
Okay, that sounds good. I want to learn how to do it right.
Yes, that sounds great! I will try my best to follow it.
Yes, that is very helpful. Thank you so much!
Thanks! See you next week!
