Hey, Xiao Ming. Sure, what do you want to talk about?
Oh, I see. Um, I am sorry. I not mean to... exclude you. We just talking about the project, you know?
I really sorry. I did not mean to hurt you. We just excited about the project. I will make sure to include you next time.
Yes, yes. I agree. We can talk more about our projects and make sure everyone feels included. How to say... let’s be more open?
Actually, I thinking about going to the park. The weather is nice, right?
We can ride bikes or have a picnic. Maybe bring some snacks and just enjoy the day.
There is a place near the park entrance. I went there last time, it’s easy to find.
How about 10 a.m.?
No problem! See you then. Good talk, Xiao Ming.
