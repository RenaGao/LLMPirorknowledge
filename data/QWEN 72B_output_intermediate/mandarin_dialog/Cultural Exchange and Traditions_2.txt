Hi! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Oh, that is great idea! I like to share my culture. What we can do?
Yes! We can make dumplings. And also, um, hotpot. People like them very much.
Ah, good idea! We can have erhu music. It is... um, Chinese violin. And also, dragon dance. It is very exciting.
Yes, we can play mahjong. It is fun game. And also, um... how to say... calligraphy writing. People like to try.
We can use red paper lanterns. And also, Chinese knots. They are very beautiful and mean good luck.
We can set up tables for food, music, and games. And also, have stage for dragon dance. We need to invite many people to join.
Sounds good to me! I can help with food and decorations. And also, invite my friends.
Yes, that work for me. We can meet at the community center?
You are welcome! I am excited. See you next Saturday!
