Hi! I'm good, thank you. Yes, I have time. What topic do you want to discuss?
Ah, the greenhouse effect. Yes, that can be... how to say... complicated. But I think I understand it a little. Can you start by explaining what it is?
Right, these gases... um, keep the heat inside. Like a glass... glass thing in a garden?
Yes, I see. But, if there are too much of these gases, it can become... how to say... not good for the Earth?
Ah, so it is like... um, adding more blankets to the Earth. More blankets make the Earth warmer.
Yes, I see. So, what can we do to help stop this?
Um, to reduce... reduce the carbon... footprint. I think this is very important. We should share this information with our group.
No, I think I understand it now. Thanks for explaining it so clearly.
Yes, that sounds great! When should we meet?
Perfect! Next weekend works for me. See you then!
You too! Bye!
