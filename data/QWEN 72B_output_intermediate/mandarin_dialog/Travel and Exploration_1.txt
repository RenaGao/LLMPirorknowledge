Hi, um, I am good. Thank you. How about you?
Sure. My favorite place is... um, how to say... West Lake in Hangzhou. It is very beautiful.
Well, it is very peaceful. You can go for walk, um, around the lake. There are many trees and flowers. It is very... um, relaxing.
Yes, I go there every year with my family. We like to, um, take boat ride and, um, eat, um, local food.
My favorite thing is, um, to feed the fish in the lake. There are many, um, goldfish and carp. It is fun to watch them.
Yes, there is, um, Dragon Boat Festival. People, um, race boats and, um, eat, um, special rice dumplings.
No, but I watch them. It is very exciting to see the, um, boats go so fast.
My favorite is, um, West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy. It is, um, very tasty and, um, a little sweet and sour.
Yes, you should, um, visit the, um, Leifeng Pagoda. It is very old and, um, has, um, nice view of the lake.
You are welcome! I hope you can come and, um, see it sometime. It is, um, really special.
You too! Bye!
