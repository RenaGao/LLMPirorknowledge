Ah, yes, thank you. I am looking for... um, how to say... the Sunflower Hotel. It is nearby?
I am at the train station. Near the... um, ticket office.
Ah, the park. I see. And then what?
Yellow sign, okay. Three blocks on left. Thank you very much. I think I can find it.
Yes, I will. Um, one more thing. Is it far to walk?
Ten minutes, that is good. Thank you very much for your help.
Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
