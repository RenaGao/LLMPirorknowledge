Hi, nice to meet you too! Um, yes, of course! Let me think... how to say... one of the most important festivals in China is Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year.
Sure! Spring Festival is, um, to celebrate the start of Chinese New Year. It is, uh, usually in January or February, depend on the lunar calendar.
People, uh, clean their house and decorate it with red paper and lanterns. Red is very lucky color. And, um, families get together for a big dinner on New Year’s Eve.
We eat many special foods, like dumplings, fish, and, uh, niangao. Dumplings are, um, shaped like gold ingots, symbolize wealth. Fish means, uh, surplus, and niangao means, um, higher every year.
Yes, we, um, give red envelopes, or hongbao, to children. The money inside is for good luck. And, uh, there are firecrackers and fireworks to scare away bad spirits.
Yes, I remember, um, when I was a child, me and my, uh, cousins would, uh, play together and, um, watch the dragon dance in the streets. It was, uh, very exciting.
Um, yes, people, uh, write couplets and paste them on doors. The couplets have, uh, good wishes and, uh, hopes for the new year.
Yes, many people, um, still celebrate, uh, the traditional way. But, uh, some, um, modernize it a bit, like using, uh, digital red envelopes on, uh, WeChat or Alipay.
You’re welcome! I, uh, happy to share. Spring Festival is, um, very important to us.
No problem! See you, and have a good day!
