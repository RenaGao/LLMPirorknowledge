Hi, um, I am good. How are you?
Yes, I have one question. Um, the homework, I not understand it very well. Can you explain, please?
The instructions, um... they say to write an essay about family traditions. But, I not sure what kind of thing to write.
Oh, I see. So, I can write about, um... how we celebrate Chinese New Year with my family?
We, um, have a big dinner. We eat dumplings and, um, we watch the New Yearâ€™s show on TV. Also, my parents give me red envelopes.
Yes, we also, um, clean the house together before the New Year. It is, um... how to say... for good luck.
The instructions say it should be, um, 500 words.
No, I think I understand now. Thank you so much for helping me!
Thank you! I will start working on it right away. See you in class!
Bye!
