Oh, hi! Yeah, it is. We want to do something special. Um, how to say... do together, you know?
Park, yes! Good idea. We can play game, maybe?
Um, frisbee, maybe? And, uh, picnic. We can bring food and drinks.
Yes, that would be nice. And, um, maybe we can bring cake and balloons?
Sure, I can do that. And, um, I can also invite other friends. You think ten people is good number?
2 p.m., yes. That is good time. We can meet at park entrance, right?
Great! I will send message to everyone and confirm. Um, anything else we need to prepare?
Yes, good idea. I will ask friends to write message. We can put in nice card.
You are welcome. I am excited! See you at park on Saturday.
You too! Bye!
