Hi! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Yes, I started yesterday. It is a lot of material to cover. You?
Good idea! I think it will be helpful. Um, how to say... we can go over the chapters together and practice questions.
Yes, the part about chemical reactions. I always get confused with the formulas.
I mean, the formulas are confusing to me.
That sounds good. I also have some practice problems that we can work on together.
How about Saturday afternoon at the library?
Three o'clock?
Sounds perfect. I will bring my notes and the textbook.
See you then! Thanks for the help!
