Hi Alex, I okay. The project... uh, it is... I think it is... big challenge, but I try my best.
Um... we finish about 60 percent. But... the deadline... how to say... it is soon.
I think... it is... possible, but... we need more time for testing and... fixing bug.
The user interface... it is... not perfect yet. And also, the database... um, connection sometimes have problem.
Yes, we talk about it. They say... we need more man-hour, but... the budget is... limited.
I think... maybe two more days would be... good. This will give us time to fix the main issue.
Yes, I agree. We will work hard to finish it on time.
No problem, Alex. I want the project to be successful.
Thank you, Alex. See you tomorrow.
