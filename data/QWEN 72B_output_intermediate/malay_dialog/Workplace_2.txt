Hi, Aiman! Yes, sure. Um, what I need to know?
Ah, okay. What, um, step we need to do first?
Okay. So, we need to, um, find information about the product and then, um, think of ideas?
Got it. We create, um, plan for, like, blog and social media?
Ah, I see. So, I will, um, help with social media and, um, work with design team?
No, I think, um, I understand. But, um, how we start the brainstorming?
Okay, that sounds good. When we, um, have the meeting?
Yes, Thursday, um, works for me.
No, I think that's all. Thank you, Aiman.
Sure, see you on Thursday. Bye!
