Hi, Aiman! I am good, thank you. You?
Um, my favorite holiday is... how to say... Hari Raya Aidilfitri. It is very special.
I like when family and friends come together. We have big meal, um, feasts. And, we visit each other house. It is, um, very warm and happy.
Yes, we have many traditions. Like, um, we wear new clothes. And, we, um, give money to children. It is called "duit raya."
Oh, we eat lot of delicious food. Like, um, rendang, lemang, and kuih. And, we always have, um, sweet drinks.
Yes, my favorite is rendang. It is, um, made with coconut milk and spices. It is very, very yummy.
We usually celebrate at home. My family, um, we cook together. And, we invite, um, neighbors and friends.
Yes, I want to, um, organize big party. I hope, um, everyone can come and enjoy.
Sure! You very welcome. We will have, um, lots of food and, um, fun.
You welcome, Aiman. It is, um, nice to talk about it.
You too, Aiman. Goodbye!
