Hi, Aiman. Yes, I have time. Please, tell me how to do it.
Um, a little bit. Not very much.
Okay, I see it. What next?
Ah, I understand. So, I put the name, and... um, date. And description, if I want to.
I see. How to add tasks?
Okay, so title, description, and... due date. And, um, who do the task?
Ah, I get it. So, I select the person, and they will know they have to do it.
Yeah, it looks simple. One more thing, how to check the progress?
Oh, I see. The chart and list show everything. Very helpful.
Thank you, Aiman. I feel more confident now.
Yes, thatâ€™s fine. See you next week!
You too, Aiman. Bye!
