Ah, hello. My name is Farah. I have a problem with my recent purchase. Um, I buy a... how to say... a thing for cooking.
Yes, a kitchen appliance. It is a blender, but it not work properly.
Sure. When I try to use it, it make a very loud noise and it not blend the food. Um, it just... uh, spin but not blend.
I notice it right after I use it for the first time. It was a few days ago.
I read the manual, but it not help. I try everything, but the problem still there.
Yes, my order number is 123456789. The model number is B123. Um, it on the bottom of the blender.
Yes, I can do that. How to send it?
I use the app. It is easier for me.
No, that is all. Thank you for your help.
Thank you, you too. Goodbye.
