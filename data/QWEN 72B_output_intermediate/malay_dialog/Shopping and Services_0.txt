Oh, good afternoon. I look for... um, how to say... thing for fixing paper.
Yes! Stapler. I need stapler. Can you show me?
Um, I need one for office work. Not too big, but strong enough for many papers.
Yes, I try. *tries the stapler* It good. But, price?
Yes, please show me.
I think... um, I choose the second one. It is enough for my work.
No, I think that is all. Thank you for helping me.
No, I think I am good. Thank you a lot.
Thank you. Goodbye!
