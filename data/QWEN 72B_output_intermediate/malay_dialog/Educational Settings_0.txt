Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?
Of course, I can try. What is the problem?
Um, how to say... You can choose any cultural tradition. It is up to you. Maybe you can write about a tradition from your own country?
Yes, we have many interesting traditions. For example, we have “Raya” celebration. It is big festival for Muslims. We have special food, and we visit family and friend.
We have “rendang,” which is a spicy meat dish. And also “ketupat,” which is rice cooked in coconut leaves. Very yummy!
Definitely! That is a great topic. You can talk about the food, the customs, and how people celebrate.
Sure. You can start with introduction about Raya, then describe the celebration, and then talk about the food and traditions. Maybe you can include some personal stories too.
You can check the library or look online. There are many articles and books about Raya. I can also share some links if you want.
No problem! I am happy to help. Good luck with your essay.
You too! Bye for now.
