Hi, Alex. Saya nama Aiman. Senang berkenalan dengan awak.
Sure, it is not far. You can go to... um, where is... the main road, Jalan Utama.
You need to turn left, then go straight for about... um, how to say... one kilometer?
Then, you see the big white building. It is the museum. It have big clock tower.
Yes, very easy. Many people visit there. You can see the sign, too.
Yes, have parking lot behind the museum. It is free, but sometimes full.
Um, the museum open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. And they have nice caf√© inside. You can rest there.
You welcome, Alex. Jangan lupa bawa kamera!
Bye, Alex. See you soon!
