Hi! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Um, it is good. I exercise... how to say... twice week. I go to gym and do some running.
Yes, I want to be more fit, and maybe lose some weight. I also want to have more strength.
I like running and doing some weight lifting. But, um... I need to improve my, how to say, form?
Not yet, but I want to try yoga. I hear it is good for flexibility and balance.
No, I never try. But I think I want to start. Maybe you can help me?
That would be good! I can come Wednesday afternoon?
How about three o'clock?
Yes, very much! Thank you for helping me.
Okey, see you then! Thank you!
