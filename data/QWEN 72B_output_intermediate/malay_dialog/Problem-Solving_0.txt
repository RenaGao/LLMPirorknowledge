Oh, hey Aiman. I am fine, thank you. What about the mall?
Um, I... I was a bit tired, and maybe I was not very happy with the food court. But it is okay, no big problem.
No, no, nothing big. Just a little thing. You know, the line for the food was very long. I was hungry and a bit frustrated.
Yes, that will be better. Thank you for understanding. I should have told you then, but I did not want to ruin the day.
Setuju! I really enjoy spending time with you, and I do not want any misunderstanding between us.
Boleh! That sounds nice. I have not been to that place yet.
Yes, that will be good. What time should we meet?
Okey, 11 a.m. is fine. I will be there.
You too, Aiman. Jumpa nanti!
