Oh, hi! Iâ€™m okay, but the homework a bit... um, difficult. I not sure what to do.
The, um, how to say... the math problem. The one about, um, the equations?
Yes, I not understand how to solve it. The teacher say we have to use, um, the formula, but I not sure which one.
No, I not want to bother him. But maybe I should, yes?
Okay, that sound good. Can we look at the problem now?
Um, I try this, but I not sure if it correct. (Shows work)
Isolate the... variable, yes. I see. So, I put the x on one side?
Okay, I try again. (Pauses) Is this right?
Thank you! I will. I feel more confident now.
No, I think I understand. Thank you so much!
Okey, see you later! Thank you again!
