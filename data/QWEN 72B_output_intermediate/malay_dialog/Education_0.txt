Oh, hello! I am good, thank you. Um, preparation, it... it okay, but I need more time to, um, study. You?
Yes, I know. Exam, it is, um, difficult. What subject you find hardest?
For me, it is... um, how to say... the essay writing. I need to practice more to improve my, um, grammar and vocabulary.
Yes, I join study group with some friends. It help a lot. We discuss, um, the topics together. What about you?
Yes, that is good idea! We can, um, share notes and, uh, practice problems together.
Um, how about, um, Friday afternoon? After class?
Let’s meet, um, four o’clock?
Um, how about the library? It is quiet and, um, good for study.
Yes, that is, um, very helpful. Thank you.
Thank you! Same to you. See you Friday.
Bye, take care!
