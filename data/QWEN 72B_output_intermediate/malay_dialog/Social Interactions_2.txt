Ah, yes! Hello, Aiman! How are you?
I am good. Thank you for call. Um... How to say... I miss talking to you.
I, um, I work at office now. And I go gym sometimes. How about you?
Oh, that is nice! You like it?
It is okay. I learn many new thing every day. Um, how to say... I feel happy.
I go to beach last weekend with my friends. It is very fun. We swim and eat seafood.
I, um, I plan to visit my family in Kelantan. I not go there long time. How about you?
That is good. You like Penang, right?
Yes, I try Nasi Lemak. It is very good. I cook it for my family.
Sure! I send you, okay. Um, we should meet soon.
Yes, that sound good. I hope you have good trip.
You too, Aiman. Talk to you soon. Bye!
