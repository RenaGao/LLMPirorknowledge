Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. You?
No, nothing yet. Why you ask?
Sure! That sound fun. Where you want to go?
Oh, the one everyone talk about? Yes, I heard it too. What they serve?
Fusion menu? What is it?
Oh, that is interesting. I like to try new food. Um, what time we should meet?
7 p.m. is good. And after that, we want to do something else?
Yes, I want to see the new action movie. Everyone say it is amazing.
Yes, that is good idea. I will book the tickets.
Me too! Thank you for inviting me. See you on Saturday!
You too! Bye!
