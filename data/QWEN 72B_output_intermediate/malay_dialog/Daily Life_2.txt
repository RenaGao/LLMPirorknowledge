Hi Aiman! I am good, thank you. The place nice. I like it. How you?
Oh, yes! I like to cook nasi lemak. It is very yummy. You want to try?
Sure, um... I start with coconut milk. First, I boil water and add coconut milk. Then, I put rice in.
Yes, and I add pandan leaf. It give nice flavor. Then, I cook it in rice cooker for one hour.
For side, I make sambal. I blend red chili, garlic, and onion. Then, I fry it with a bit of oil and tamarind.
Yes, I use cucumber and egg. Sometimes, I add peanuts too. It is very, very good.
Oh, you can use less chili. Or, you can take out the seeds. It will be less spicy.
How about Saturday? It is good day for cooking.
Yes, morning is good. We can have lunch together.
You welcome! I am happy to cook with you. See you Saturday!
Bye, Aiman!
