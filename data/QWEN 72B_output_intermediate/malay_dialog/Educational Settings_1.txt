Hi Aiman! Yes, I have time. How about you?
Not really. I am a bit... um, how to say... scare about it. It is big test, right?
Oh, that sound good! What do you think we should do first?
Yes, I think that is good idea. But, I have problem with understanding some of the... um, concepts. Like, the one about photosynthesis.
Yes, diagram is good. That help me a lot. And, we also need to memorize some formulas, right?
Flashcard, yes. I like that. We can also discuss the questions we find difficult, so we can understand them better.
How about tomorrow after class? In the library?
Sure, I can bring. And I will bring my notes too. See you tomorrow!
You too, Aiman! Bye!
