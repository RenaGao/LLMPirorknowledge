Hello, I am good, thank you. How about you?
Yes, that is good idea. Um... in Malaysia, we have some... how to say... rules for eating.
Sure. In Malaysia, we use... um, fork and spoon. Fork for pushing food, and spoon for eating.
Yes, for some... how to say... traditional food. Like nasi lemak or roti canai. We use our right hand.
Yes, always right hand. Left hand is... um, not clean.
Oh, I see. In Malaysia, we usually put hands on lap when not eating. It is more polite.
Not so much. In Malaysia, service charge is usually included in the bill. But sometimes, if service is very good, people may give small tip.
No, it is not polite. We try to eat quietly. But sometimes, when eating certain... um, soup or noodles, slight noise is okay.
Yes, it is good to learn. Culture is very... um, interesting.
You are welcome. I learn also from you. Thank you.
Yes, talk to you later. Bye!
