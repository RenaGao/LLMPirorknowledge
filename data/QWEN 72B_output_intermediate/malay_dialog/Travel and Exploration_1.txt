Hi, I am good. Thank you. You how are?
Yes, I have one. It is... um, a place near my home, called Pantai Merdeka.
Sure. It is nice beach. Have sand and sea. People go there for relax and play.
I go with family. We build sandcastle and swim. Sometimes, we have picnic. It very fun.
Special because... um, it have good memory. I go there since I small. My family, we always happy there.
Yes. I like to walk along the beach and look for shell. And, um, watch sunset. It very beautiful.
Sometimes, we play frisbee or volleyball. But, most, I just like to sit and enjoy the view. It very peaceful.
I try to go every month. If I busy, maybe every two month. But I always remember it.
You welcome. I happy to talk about. Maybe one day, you can come visit too.
You too. Bye-bye!
