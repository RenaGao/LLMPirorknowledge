Hi! I am good, thank you. Yes, I free this weekend. Why, you want to do something?
Oh, that sound nice! Where you want to go?
No, I never go. But I hear it is very nice. What we can do there?
I like to see the city, and maybe we can go to a museum? How about that?
Sure, I like shopping. But we also can, um, how to say... take a walk in the park?
That is good to know. We can plan to go there. When we want to meet?
Yes, 10 a.m. is good. Where we should meet exactly?
Okay, I will be there. We need to bring water and some snacks?
Alright, I will do that. See you on Saturday!
You too! Bye-bye!
