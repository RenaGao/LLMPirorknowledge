Hi, I am good, thank you. You?
Oh, yes, I have think about it. It is good idea. What you suggest we do?
Um, that is nice. We can do... how to say... the Joget dance. It is fun and colorful.
Yes, we can have Nasi Lemak, it is very popular. And also, uh, Satay. People like it a lot.
Yes, we can have, um... Congkak. It is game with small wooden board and shells.
Yes, we can teach how to make Bunga Telur, it is decoration made from eggshells. And also, um, Batik painting.
Yes, that is good idea. We can write about history and culture of Malaysia.
Sure, I can give speech. I will talk about, um, the importance of culture and tradition in Malay society.
