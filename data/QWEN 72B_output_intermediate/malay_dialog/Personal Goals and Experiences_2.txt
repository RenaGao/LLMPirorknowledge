Hi, I am good, thank you. How about you?
Um, recently I... I complete my course for web design. It is... it was online course, and I study very hard for it.
It take about... about three month. I learn many thing, like HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
I want to... how to say... upgrade my skill. And also, I like to create website. It is... it is fun and challenging for me.
Yes, I have to make website for... um... small business. It is for... for bakery. I design it and it look very nice. I... I proud of it.
The most... most difficult part is... um... how to make it responsive. I mean, it must look good on phone and on computer. It... it take a lot of time to fix.
I feel very happy and... and proud. I think it is good step for my career. And I... I want to learn more about web design.
I want to find some freelance work to gain more experience. And also, I want to take another course, maybe for... for advanced JavaScript.
Thank you very much. I... I really appreciate your support.
Yes, letâ€™s talk again. Thank you, bye!
