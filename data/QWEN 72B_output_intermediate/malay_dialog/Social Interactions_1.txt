Hi! I am good, thank you. Ali's birthday surprise? Yes, I want to talk about it. How to start, lah?
Ali's birthday is this Saturday. Um, how about we start the surprise at 7 p.m.?
I think we can have it at his house. His place big and we have space for everyone.
I check with a few friends. I think about 20 people will come.
I want to make it colorful. We can use balloons and streamers. Maybe some banners too?
I can bring some kuih and snacks. We can also order some pizza and drinks from the nearby restaurant.
I think Ali likes chocolate cake. Maybe we can get a chocolate one?
We can play some games like musical chairs and pass the parcel. It will be fun for everyone.
Yes, I think that is good. We can buy something special for him, like a new book or a gadget.
Yes, it sounds good! Thank you for helping with the planning.
Yes, see you then! Bye-bye!
