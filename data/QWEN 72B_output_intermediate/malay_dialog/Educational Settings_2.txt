Hi, Aiman! I fine, thanks. How about you?
Yes, I have one. I think... um, the topic about... how to say... the theory of relativity. It is very hard for me.
Um... I donâ€™t understand the concept of time dilation. How time can be different for different people.
Yes, I know that. But how the time... how to say... change?
Oh, I see. So, if I travel very fast, my time will... um, slow down?
That is very interesting. But... how to apply it in real life?
Ah, I understand now. So, the GPS need to fix the time difference to work properly?
I think I need more practice, but I understand the basic idea now. Thank you, Aiman!
Boleh! See you next time, Aiman. Thank you again.
You too! Bye!
