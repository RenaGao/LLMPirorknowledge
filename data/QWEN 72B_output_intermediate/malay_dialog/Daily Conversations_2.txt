Hi, Aiman! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Um, let see. I think the most memorable thing happen last week, when I go to the new mall with my friends. It is really big and have many new thing.
We go to the food court and try new food. It very delicious. Also, we see the new movie everyone talk about.
It is... how to say... the action movie, very famous. I forget the name, but all the people in the food court talk about it.
Yes, I enjoy it very much. The action is so cool, and the story is interesting. We all have good time.
We go to the shops and look at new clothes. I buy new shirt for myself. It very nice.
Yes, I try it on. It fit me well, so I buy it. I wear it to school yesterday, and my friend say it look good on me.
I feel very happy. It is nice to spend time with my friends and do fun thing. I think we should do it again soon.
You welcome! It was good to talk about it. Talk to you later, Aiman!
