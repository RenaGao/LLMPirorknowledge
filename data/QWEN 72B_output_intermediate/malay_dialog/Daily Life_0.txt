Hi Aiman! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Um, yeah... I wake up early, around 6 a.m. Then I pray subuh. After that, I take shower.
I make breakfast, usually some nasi lemak or toast. Sometimes I have cereal too. Then I go to my room and read some book or check my emails.
About 30 minutes. Then I get ready for work. Um, I pack my bag, and I make sure I have everything I need for the day.
Yes, sometimes I do some yoga or stretching. It depends on how I feel that day. If I am tired, I just do a short walk around my house.
I am curious too! What do you do?
That sounds healthy! Do you have any other morning activities?
Meditation is good. I should try that. It sounds relaxing.
I go to my office. I work in marketing. I start my day with a team meeting. Then I handle emails and work on projects.
Yes, it helps a lot. Thanks for sharing your routine too, Aiman!
You too! Take care, Aiman. Bye!
