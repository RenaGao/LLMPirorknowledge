Hi Aiman, I am fine. How about you?
Oh, yes. I also want to talk about that. I think... um, it was a bit of a problem.
Okay, um... when you said the teams, I felt like I was not chosen. It make me feel a bit left out.
I know, but you know, in Malay culture, it is important to include everyone, even if they are not the best player.
I value our friendship too. I think we can solve this. How about next time, we can pick teams together, so everyone feels included?
No problem, Aiman. We are friends, right? We should always be honest with each other.
Yes, that sounds good! I am free this weekend.
Eleven a.m. is fine. See you then!
You too, Aiman. Bye!
