Hi Aiman! I am fine, thank you. How about you?
Yes, I start already. But, um, I have some problem with the data entry.
The data, it is not, um, how to say... not organize well. I think I need help to clean it.
Yes, that will be good. When we can meet?
2 p.m. is fine for me. Should I bring my laptop?
Okay, thank you. Um, do you think we can finish it by Friday?
Yes, I agree. I will try my best. Thank you for help!
See you then. Thank you, Aiman. Bye!
