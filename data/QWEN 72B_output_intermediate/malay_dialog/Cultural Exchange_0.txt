Oh, hello! Yes, sure. Um, one of the most important festival in Malaysia is Hari Raya Aidilfitri. It is very special for Muslims.
Sure. Hari Raya Aidilfitri, we call it Raya. It is to celebrate the end of fasting month, Ramadhan. People fast for one month, and after that, we have big celebration.
We do many things. Um, people go to mosque for prayer, and after that, we visit family and friend. We wear new clothes, and we give gift. Also, we have special food, like ketupat and rendang.
Ketupat is rice cook in coconut leaf, and rendang is meat cook with coconut milk and spices. It is very yummy.
Yes, um, we also do something called "open house." It is when people open their house for visitor, and everyone can come to eat and celebrate together. It is very fun.
We clean house, decorate with lights and flowers. We buy new clothes, and we prepare food. It take many days to prepare, but it is worth it.
Yes, many non-Muslims join too. It is very welcoming. They come to open house, bring gift, and celebrate together. It is good for community.
You are welcome! I happy to share. If you ever come to Malaysia, you should experience it yourself!
You too! Bye-bye!
