Hi Aiman! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Um, yes, I hear about it. The deadline is soon, right?
I think it is good idea. We need to... um, make sure everything is ready on time.
Sure. We need to finish the report, and also, um, update the database. We need to, um, check the data.
Yes, and we need to, um, send the final report to the manager for review.
Okay, I can do that. You will do the report?
That sounds good. We meet, um, Wednesday?
Okay, 2 p.m. in the conference room. I will, um, send a reminder.
No problem, Aiman. We can do this. See you Wednesday.
You too. Bye!
