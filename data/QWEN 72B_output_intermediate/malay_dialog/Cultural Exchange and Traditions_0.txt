Hi, I am good. How about you?
Oh, sure! I can tell about Hari Raya Aidilfitri. It is very important festival for us.
Yes, Hari Raya Aidilfitri is end of Ramadhan. Ramadhan is month where we fast from sunrise to sunset. Um... it is joyful time for us.
We usually wear traditional clothes, like baju kurung. We go to mosque for special prayer, and after that, we visit family and friends.
Yes, we have many special foods. Um... like ketupat, which is rice wrapped in leaves. And alsoabcdayam lemak, it is spicy rice with chicken.
Yes, we also give gifts and money to children, called duit raya. It is way to show love and care.
We clean our house, buy new clothes, and prepare food. We also decorate our house with lights and flowers.
Yes, I remember when I was young, we all gather at my grandparentsâ€™ house. We pray together, eat together, and play games. It is very happy time for me.
Yes, it is. I miss those times now. How about you? Do you have any special traditions in your culture?
Oh, that is nice! I would like to experience it one day.
You are welcome! I am glad you find it interesting. We should keep in touch and maybe celebrate our traditions together some day.
See you soon! Bye!
