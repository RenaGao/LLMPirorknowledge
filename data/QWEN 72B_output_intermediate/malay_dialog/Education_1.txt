Hi, Farah! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Um, the topic is... how to say... it is about the theory of relativity. I find it difficult to understand.
Yes, please. I would like that very much.
Oh, I see. Time and space change... um, how to say... different for fast things.
Time dilation... it is like time move slower for fast thing.
Gravity affect... um, space and time. It is very hard to imagine.
Space is like fabric... and big thing make it curve. This is how gravity work.
Oh, I understand now. It is like... how to say... object follow the curve.
Yes, it is very interesting. Thank you for explaining it to me, Farah.
No, I think I understand it better now. Thank you again.
Yes, see you there! Thanks for the help.
