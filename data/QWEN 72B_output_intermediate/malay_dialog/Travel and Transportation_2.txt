Hi Aiman! Iâ€™m good, thanks. Not really, how about you?
Um, how about we go to the beach? I think it is nice. Maybe Langkawi?
I like to go um... to the beach, of course. And we can do the cable car, right? It is very famous.
Yes, I like that. Maybe we can um... do snorkeling or jet ski?
Ooh, turtle sanctuary! That is good. I want to see the turtles.
Yes, I like that. Maybe we can find a place near the beach too?
I think I am free from Friday to Sunday. How about you?
Yes, that is good. We can start packing soon.
Okay! I will wait for your message. Thanks, Aiman.
Yes, see you soon! Bye!
