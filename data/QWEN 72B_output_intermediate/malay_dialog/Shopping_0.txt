**Scene: A native English speaker (NS) is shopping and needs help finding a product. They approach a Malay-speaking shop assistant (L2) for assistance.**
Oh, of course! What you look for?
Yes, we have. What kind of phone you have?
Ah, iPhone 12. Let me check. One moment, please.
(Returns) Here, we have this one. It is compatible with your phone. You want to take a look?
Of course. (Hands over the charger) This is the charger. It is... um, fast charging, yes.
It is thirty-five ringgit.
Yes, we have another one. (Points to another charger) This one is, um, twenty-five ringgit. It is good quality too.
Sure. (Hands over the second charger) Here you go. It is twenty-five ringgit.
Yes, sure. Follow me. (Leads the way) Here are the power banks. Which one you like?
This one is forty ringgit.
You welcome! Anything else you need?
No problem. Have a good day!
Goodbye!
