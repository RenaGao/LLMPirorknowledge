Hi! I am good, thank you. And you?
Um, how to say... next week maybe? Perhaps Wednesday or Thursday?
2 p.m. is fine. That work for me. What we need to talk about in the meeting?
Yes, um, we can talk about the new marketing strategy. And also, maybe some team building activities?
Sounds good to me. We need to send out the agenda to everyone too, right?
Sure, I can help. Just tell me what to do.
Um, we can have a quiz night or maybe go for some outdoor activity, like a picnic?
You welcome! I am glad to help. See you on Wednesday then?
You too! Goodbye!
