Sure, I can help you. You from where now?
Oh, I see. Post office, how to say... it is in the city center, right?
Okay, so from there, you go straight until you see the big park.
After park, you turn left. There is a street with many shops. You keep walking, about five minutes.
You will see a tall building on your right side. That is the Grand Hotel. You cannot miss it, very big.
Yes, exactly! That is correct. Very easy.
You are welcome. If you need more help, just ask anyone. Everyone is friendly here.
You too! Good luck, and see you around maybe.
Bye-bye!
