Hi, I am good, thank you. How about you?
Yes, I want to learn... um, how to say... cooking.
I want to learn... um, how to cook, like, local dishes. Malay food, I mean.
I think, um... it is important because... it is part of my culture. And, I want to, um... share it with my friends and family.
Yes, I try to make... um, Nasi Lemak. But it is not easy. I need more practice.
The, um... how to say... coconut milk, it is hard to get it right. And the, um... spices, I sometimes use too much.
Yes, I think so. I also read some... um, recipe books. My mother, she teach me some, too.
Yes, I want to make Rendang. It is famous, and I really like it.
I try to, um... cook it slowly. And use, um... fresh ingredients, like lemongrass and galangal.
Thank you! I will keep trying. It is fun, and I enjoy it a lot.
Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
