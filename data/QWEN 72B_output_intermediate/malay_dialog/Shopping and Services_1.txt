Hi, I am good, thank you. How to say... I am thinking about buying new laptop. You can help me?
Um... for work. I need it for my study and project.
Yes, I need it small, and battery must be long. And... how to say... it must be fast.
Budget... I think around one thousand... um, dollars.
Yes, I look at some. But I not sure... how to choose.
I like... um... Apple. But I think it is too expensive. Maybe... how to say... Dell or HP?
I look at some, but I not sure. Can you give me advice?
Oh, I see. Can you tell me more about... um... the HP one?
That sounds good. And the price?
Thank you so much! I will look at it today. Maybe I buy it.
Thank you! I will tell you if I buy it. Bye!
