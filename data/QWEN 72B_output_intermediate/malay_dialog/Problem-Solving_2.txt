Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?
Oh, really? How to say... What mistake?
Ah, I see. No problem, can you change the time?
That is good. Thank you. How to say... Can you also check if the new filem, the one everyone talks about, is playing then?
Okay, thank you. I will wait for your message.
No, it is okay. Mistakes happen. I appreciate you fixing it.
Yes, no worries. Talk to you soon.
You too, bye!
