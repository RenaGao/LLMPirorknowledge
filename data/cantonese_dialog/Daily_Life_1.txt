peaker A (NS):** Hi, thanks for meeting with me today! Are you thinking about any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, um, yes, I am thinking to have picnic with family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! Where are you planning to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We not decide yet. Maybe... um, how to say... the big park? With the lake?

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you mean the city park with the lake?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes, city park. It is good for picnic, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! It's a great spot. What do you plan to bring for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, we bring food, like sandwiches, fruit, and maybe some, um, rice thing?

**Speaker A (NS):** Rice thing? Like rice balls or sushi?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, rice balls, that's it! My children like them very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious. Will you have any activities planned for the kids?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we bring... um, ball? For play games. And maybe kite if wind is strong.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you need to prepare anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I think... um, need to bring mat to sit. And also, how to say... sun protection?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sunscreen, you mean? And maybe a hat?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, sunscreen and hat! So we don't get, um, too hot and burn.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. Is everyone looking forward to it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, my family very excited. We not have picnic for long time.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure it will be a great day out. Let me know how it goes!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, thank you for help. I will tell you aft
