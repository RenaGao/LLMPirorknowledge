peaker A (NS - Trainer):** Hi there! I'm glad you could make it today. How are you feeling about starting a new exercise routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I am feeling good, but also a bit... how to say... nervous?

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** That's totally normal! Many people feel a bit anxious at first. What are your main fitness goals?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I want to, uh, lose weight. Also, get stronger, you know, more muscle.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Great goals! Building muscle and losing weight can definitely go hand in hand. Do you have any specific exercises you like or want to try?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like swimming because it is, um, good for body. But I want try... um, gym weights?

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Swimming is excellent! And weightlifting is a great idea. It helps with strength. Have you lifted weights before?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, not really. It's, uh, new for me. I worry I do wrong.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** No worries at all! We'll start with the basics and build from there. How often do you plan to exercise each week?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe... three times? I think it is... how to say... not too much?

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Three times a week is a good start. We can adjust as you go along. Any particular time of day you prefer?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, morning is best for me. Before work, I think better energy.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Perfect, morning sessions can really energize you for the day. How do you feel about combining cardio with weights?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Cardio is, um, running, right? I think... yes, I can try. Is it too much?

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Not at all! We'll balance it out. Short cardio sessions paired with weights can be very effective.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, sounds good. I also need to, um, eat better. What food is good?

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** Nutrition is key! Focus on whole foods like vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Do you like cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like cooking. I make rice and... um, vegetables quite often.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** That's a great start! We can explore more recipes that fit your goals. How are you feeling about all this?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I feel... excited and ready. Thank you for helping.

**Speaker A (NS - Trainer):** You're welcome! I'm excited too. Let's get started and have some fun with
