peaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m curious about festivals in your country. Can you tell me about one?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, of course. Um, we have a festival called Mid-Autumn Festival. You heard before?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I’ve heard of it! Could you explain more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is a... how to say... family festival. We celebrate with mooncakes and lanterns.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! What’s the story behind it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** The story is about a woman, Chang’e. She fly to moon after, um, drink a... special potion.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, interesting! Why do people eat mooncakes?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Mooncakes, they are for... um, sharing. Like share happiness with family and friends. They have... egg inside, sweet paste.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. And the lanterns, what do they symbolize?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Lanterns, they mean... light and hope. Children like to carry them at night.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s beautiful! Do you have any special activities during the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we... um, gather with family. Eat dinner together, look at the moon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do people give gifts during this time?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sometimes, we give mooncakes as gift. To show... um, respect and good wishes.

**Speaker A (NS):** How long does the festival last?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It is mainly one day, but we prepare, um, before. And sometimes celebrate few days.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful. Is there a specific day for the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is on the... um, 15th day of eighth lunar month. When the moon is... very round and bright.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for explaining! Do you have a favorite part of the festival?
