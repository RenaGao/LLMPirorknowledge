peaker A (NS):** Hey, are you ready for the exam next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, um, not really. I still need to study more, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. What part do you find the hardest?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, the, how you say, the writing part? I always make mistake in grammar.

**Speaker A (NS):** The writing can be tricky. Do you want to practice together?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that would be good! You can help me with... um, sentences?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with sentence structure. Maybe we can start with some sample essays?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sample essay, yes. I have some from teacher, but not understand all.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, we can go over them together. How about tomorrow after class?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Tomorrow is good. After class, um, maybe around three o'clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Three o'clock works for me. We can meet in the library.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Library, okay. Thank you. You are always very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! How are you doing with the reading section?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Reading... I think better. But sometimes vocabulary is difficult.

**Speaker A (NS):** We can work on that, too. Do you use flashcards or any apps?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I use app. It helps, but sometimes I forget word.

**Speaker A (NS):** That happens. Repetition is key. We can quiz each other.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Quiz sounds fun! I will bring my notes, too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea. We’ll cover as much as we can. Feeling a bit more confident?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, a bit more now. Thank you for studying with me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! We’ll get through this exam together. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you tomorrow! B
