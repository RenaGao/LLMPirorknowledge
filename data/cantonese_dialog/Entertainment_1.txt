peaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, do you have any plans for this Friday evening?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, not really. I think we can go out, maybe dinner? I don’t know which place good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, do you have any kind of food in mind? Like Italian, Japanese, or something else?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I like Japanese food! But, uh, not sure the restaurant name... How to say... sushi place near Central?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, do you mean Sushi Saito? It’s quite popular.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, Sushi Saito! You think we can get table there?

**Speaker A (NS):** It might be a bit busy, but I can call to check if they have a reservation available.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, thank you. If cannot, we try other place. Maybe... um, hot pot?

**Speaker A (NS):** Hot pot sounds nice too. There’s a great spot called Haidilao, would you like to try that if sushi doesn’t work out?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, Haidilao! I hear they have good service. We can go.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, I’ll call Sushi Saito first, and if not, we’ll go for hot pot. Anything else you want to do after dinner?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, maybe watch movie? I hear new Marvel movie is out.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! We can check the movie times after dinner. Do you want to book the tickets now or wait?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Better we book now, I think. Many people go see Marvel.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good thinking. I’ll check online for showtimes and book two tickets.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I’m very excited. Long time no see movie in cinema.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s going to be fun! What time should we meet on Friday?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, maybe 6 o’clock? Is that okay for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, 6 o’clock works perfectly. We’ll meet at the MTR station?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sure, MTR station is good. I will see you there!

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, see you on Friday at 6 then!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, see you Friday! Thank you for planning!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Mei! Looking forward to
