peaker A (NS):** Hi there! You seem a bit lost. Can I help you with anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, yes, please. I looking for hotel... um, how to say... nearby hotel.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you're looking for a nearby hotel? Sure, I can help with that. Do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think it is... um, "Blue Sky Hotel"? Not sure the full name.

**Speaker A (NS):** Blue Sky Hotel, got it. Let me think for a moment. It's not far from here. Do you know which street it's on?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, yes, I think on, um, Main Road?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right! It's on Main Road. You'll want to head straight down this street, and then turn left at the second traffic light.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Second traffic light, then left. Okay, got it. And then?

**Speaker A (NS):** After you turn left, you should see the hotel on your right, just a few blocks down. You can't miss it.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, okay. Thank you. And, um, how long it take to walk there?

**Speaker A (NS):** It should take about 10 to 15 minutes on foot. Are you okay with walking?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, walking is good. Uh, the weather is nice today.

**Speaker A (NS):** It is! Perfect for a walk. Do you need help with anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, one more thing. Is there... how to say... supermarket near hotel?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, there's a supermarket just a block away from the hotel. It's quite convenient.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, very good! I need to buy some, um, snacks and water.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! You'll find plenty of options there. Do you need directions to the supermarket too?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, it's okay. I think I can find. Thank you, you are very helpful!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! If you need anything else, just ask. Enjoy your stay!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sure, I will. Thank you very much. Bye!
