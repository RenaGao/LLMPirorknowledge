peaker A (NS):** Hey, Mei! Have you ever noticed any differences in dining etiquette between here and back home?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes! There are many difference, um... how to say... like, how people use chopsticks and fork.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, chopsticks are more common in Cantonese culture. Do you find any other big differences?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, in restaurant, we maybe share more dishes. Here, sometimes people have own plate.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, sharing dishes is a big part of family meals, isn’t it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, exactly! We put many dish in middle and everyone take, um, little by little.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice and communal. How about table manners? Anything specific you can think of?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, yes. In Cantonese culture, we don’t, um, stick chopsticks in rice bowl. It’s... not polite.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard that. It resembles incense sticks used in funerals, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes, that is why. Also, we don’t, um, pass food with chopsticks. We use serving spoon.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, when going someone home, it is good to bring gift. Maybe fruit or... um, what is word... dessert?

**Speaker A (NS):** Dessert, yes. That’s a thoughtful gesture. Do you usually start eating as soon as the food is served?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, we wait for elder to start first. Respect for them, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** I see, showing respect to elders is important. What about using napkins? Are they commonly used?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, not always. Maybe we use tissue more. Napkin is, uh, more Western style?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I think so. And how do you show that you’ve finished eating?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We put chopstick on holder or beside bowl. And maybe say something like... um, thank you for meal.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds polite. Are there any superstitions related to dining?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we don’t turn fish over. It mean bad luck for fisherman, like boat will... um, flip.

**Speaker A (NS):** Interesting. I’ve learned so much. Thanks for sharing all this with me, Mei!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You’re welcome! It was nice to talk about this. Let’s eat together soon, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I’d love th
