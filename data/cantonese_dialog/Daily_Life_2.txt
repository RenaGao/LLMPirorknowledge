peaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for showing me how to cook your favorite meal. I’m really excited to learn!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, I am happy to share! It is, um, how to say... chicken rice. Very simple but tasty.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What do we need to get started?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We need chicken, rice, garlic, and ginger. Ah, and some, um, how to say, soy sauce and... chicken soup, uh... broth?

**Speaker A (NS):** Broth, right. How do we prepare the chicken?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** First, we clean chicken. Then, boil it in water with ginger and garlic. Boil for, um, maybe 20 minute.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Do we need to marinate the chicken?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, not need to marinate. Just boil and it will taste good. Um, after boil, we cut chicken into pieces.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, sounds straightforward. What about the rice?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, rice very important! Use chicken broth to cook rice, not water. It give, um, more flavor.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious. How much broth should we use?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Use same amount like water. If one cup rice, then one cup broth. 

**Speaker A (NS):** I see, that makes sense. What’s next after the rice?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We wait rice to cook. Then, we make sauce for chicken. Mix soy sauce, um, sesame oil, and garlic.

**Speaker A (NS):** I love sesame oil! How much do we need?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Just a little. One teaspoon maybe, for nice smell.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Is there anything else we should prepare?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, if you like, we can make side dish. Uh, cucumber with a bit vinegar.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds refreshing. How do we prepare the cucumber?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Just slice cucumber thin, add vinegar, a little sugar, and salt. Mix well.

**Speaker A (NS):** Simple and easy. I like that. Is everything ready to serve after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we put rice on plate, chicken on top, and sauce. Cucumber on side. All done!

**Speaker A (NS):** Fantastic. I really appreciate you showing me how to make this.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No problem! I hope you like it. We can cook together more times.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that. Thanks again for sharing your reci
