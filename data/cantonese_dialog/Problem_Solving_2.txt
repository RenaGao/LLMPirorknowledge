peaker A (NS):** Hey, Wing, do you have a moment to talk?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes, Mei. I have time now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. I wanted to talk about the report we submitted yesterday. It seems there was a small error in the data.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, really? I did not notice. What, uh, what is wrong?

**Speaker A (NS):** The numbers in the sales section don’t add up correctly. I think it could be a calculation mistake.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I see. I am... I feel sorry about that. I will look at it right away.

**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry about it! Mistakes happen. How do you think we can fix it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I can check the, how to say... original data first? And then redo the calculations.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. Do you need any help with it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe, uh, can you check other sections while I fix the sales part?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I can do that. We’ll make sure everything is correct.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, Mei. Really appreciate your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all! When do you think you’ll have the corrections done by?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I think today... no, maybe tomorrow morning is better.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s totally fine. I’ll review the other sections by then too.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Good, good. I will check each number carefully.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a solid approach. Let me know if you need anything else.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I will. And, um, sorry again for the mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** Really, it’s okay, Wing. We’re a team, and we’ll sort it out together.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, team is important. Thank you for understanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime. Let’s catch up tomorrow once we’re both done. 

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, see you tomorrow, Mei.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then, Wi
