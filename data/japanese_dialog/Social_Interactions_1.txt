peaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! Do you have some time to talk about Minami's birthday?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, of course. I have time. Minami's birthday... um, when is it again?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s next Saturday. We should plan something fun for her.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, yes. Next Saturday. Uh, what do you think we should do?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about a surprise party? We can invite her close friends.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Surprise party... sounds good! Um, where should we do the party?

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe at my place? I have enough space for everyone.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, your place. Yes, that is good idea. What about food?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could order some of her favorite foods. Do you know what she likes?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, she likes sushi and... ah, pizza too. Should we also have cake?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! We can get her favorite chocolate cake. Do you know a good bakery?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, there is one near my house. I can... um, I can order it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And for drinks, maybe some soda and juice?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, soda and juice. Um, do we need decoration?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, some balloons and a “Happy Birthday” banner would be nice. Can you help with that?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sure, I can buy balloons and banner. When do we set up?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about Friday evening? We can set everything up then.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Friday evening is good. I will bring decorations, and you do... um, what was it?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll handle the invitations and order the food.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Perfect! Um, how to get Minami to your place?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll ask her to come for a casual hangout. She won’t suspect anything.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sounds good plan. I hope she enjoys it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure she will! We’ll make it a great day.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I am excited! Thank you for planning with me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Yuki. See you Friday for set
