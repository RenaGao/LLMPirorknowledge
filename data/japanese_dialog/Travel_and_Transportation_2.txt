peaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! It’s been a while. How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello, Sarah! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks! I was thinking, maybe we should plan a group vacation. Do you have any places in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, vacation sounds nice! Um, how about... Kyoto? I think it is very beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Kyoto is a great choice! There’s so much history and culture there. What do you think we should do while we’re there?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, um... maybe we can visit, uh, temples? And see, uh, how to say... traditional houses?

**Speaker A (NS):** Traditional houses, like the old townhouses? Those are called “machiya.” That sounds wonderful!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, machiya! And also, I want to try Kyoto food... um, like kyo-kaiseki?

**Speaker A (NS):** Kyo-kaiseki is a must-try, definitely! It’s such a unique culinary experience. How should we get there, by the way?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I think... shinkansen? It’s fast, but maybe, uh... expensive?

**Speaker A (NS):** True, the bullet train is quick but can be pricey. We could consider the express bus if we want to save money.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, express bus is good idea too. Maybe, um, we can check price for both?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a smart plan! We should compare the costs. Do you think we’ll need to book accommodations soon?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Better to book early, I think. Maybe a... ryokan? For real Japanese experience.

**Speaker A (NS):** A ryokan sounds perfect! Staying in a traditional inn would be really special. How many people do you think will join us?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think, um, maybe five? Or six? I ask some friends if they want to come.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! Let’s gather a small group. Do you want to handle the message to everyone?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I can do it! I will... um, make a group chat and tell them our plan.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Once we have everyone’s responses, we can finalize our itinerary. Looking forward to it!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, me too! It will be fun, I think. Thank you, Sarah, for planning with me!

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Yuki! It’s going to be an exciting trip. Let’s chat again soon to sort out the details.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, let’s do that. See you soon, Sarah!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you soon, Yuki! Take ca
