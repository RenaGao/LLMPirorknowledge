peaker A (NS):** Hi there! Welcome to the team. How are you settling in?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello! I am, um, little nervous. But everyone nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's completely normal. Don't worry, we're here to help. So, today I’ll explain your first task. Are you ready?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I am ready. Please tell me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. We need to organize the digital files on the server. Have you used our system before?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Uh, not yet. I see the system, but not use it yet.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. It’s quite simple. You’ll categorize the files and move them into appropriate folders.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, okay. Category... files. And move to folder, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Make sure each file is labeled correctly before moving. Do you need help with the categories?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes please. Category is, uh, like topic? Or date?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. Mostly by topic, but sometimes by project name. We have a guide for this.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see. Guide... is it online?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it's on our internal wiki. I’ll send you the link after this.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. And, um, how many files to organize?

**Speaker A (NS):** There are about 200 files. It might take a few days.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** 200 files... okay, I will do my best.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you’ll do great. If you have questions, just ask. We’re all here to support you.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you very much. It is helpful. Uh, who should I ask, if question?

**Speaker A (NS):** You can ask me or anyone on the team. Just send a message or come by our desks.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I understand. I feel better now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that. You’ve got this! When can you start working on it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I can start today. After lunch, maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s check in tomorrow to see how it’s going.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you. I will work hard. See you tomorrow.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow! Good luck, and welcome again to the te
