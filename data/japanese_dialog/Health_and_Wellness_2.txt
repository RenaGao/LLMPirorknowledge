peaker A (NS):** Hi, welcome to our fitness center! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello. Um, I want to start exercise. I am not sure how to... how to begin.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, we can work on that together. Do you have any fitness goals in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to be... more healthy. Also, maybe lose some weight, like five kilo.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great goal. Do you have any specific exercises you like or want to try?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, I like, uh... walking and maybe... how to say... running but slow?

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean jogging, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah yes, jogging. I like jogging but not very fast.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great start. We can create a plan with walking and jogging. How often would you like to work out?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe three times in a week? Is this good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, three times a week is a good start. We can adjust as you progress. How about any strength training?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, strength training... like lifting heavy thing?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. It helps build muscle and improve metabolism.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see. I can try... but not too heavy, please.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, we will start with light weights. Do you have any concerns or things to avoid?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** My knee sometimes hurt, so maybe not too much... jumping?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, we can avoid high-impact exercises. Let’s focus on low-impact workouts instead.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. Um, what about food? Should I eat special?

**Speaker A (NS):** A balanced diet is important. Focus on vegetables, protein, and whole grains. Do you need any suggestions?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, please. I eat rice a lot. Is rice okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Rice is fine in moderation. Just try to include variety, like quinoa or brown rice sometimes.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I will try. Thank you for helping me.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let’s schedule your first session and get started.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I look forward to it. Thank y
