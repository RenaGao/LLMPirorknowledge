peaker A (NS):** Hi, have you thought about what you want to do this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes, I think about picnic. With family. How to say... in park?

**Speaker A (NS):** A picnic in the park sounds lovely! Do you know which park youâ€™ll go to?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, maybe, uh, the one near station? It is called... um, Sakura Park.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sakura Park is a great choice. Do you have everything you need for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I have some things. Need to buy food. Um, sandwich things and drinks.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sandwiches and drinks are perfect. Are you planning any activities for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to play... how to say... ball game with kids. And maybe kite?

**Speaker A (NS):** Playing ball and flying kites sounds fun! Do you know what time you'll go?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Uh, in morning, maybe around... um, ten o'clock. Is good time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten o'clock sounds like a great time. Make sure to bring sunscreen, just in case.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, sunscreen! I forget. Thank you for remind... reminding me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Do you have a way to keep everything cool, like a cooler?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Cooler? Ah, yes, we have small one. For drink and sandwich.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great. Do you need help with anything else for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I think is okay. Maybe just check weather. Hope no rain!

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. Checking the weather is important. I hope the sun will shine for you.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I hope so too. Kids like sunny day for play.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure they will have a wonderful time. Do you have any plans for after the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** After picnic, maybe, um, relax at home. Watch movie with family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a perfect day. Enjoy your picnic and family time!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I will. Have nice weekend t
