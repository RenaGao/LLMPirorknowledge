peaker A (NS):** Hi Hiroshi, ready to discuss our study topic today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, I am ready. But, um, this topic is... hard for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, we can take it step by step. What part is challenging for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It is about, uh, economics. The supply and... um, demand? I not understand well.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, supply and demand. It’s a fundamental concept. Want me to explain it briefly?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, please. That help me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so supply is how much of a product is available. Demand is how much people want it. When demand goes up, prices usually go up too.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, I see. So, if many people want, price is high?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And if the supply is high, but demand is low, what do you think happens to the price?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... price go down?

**Speaker A (NS):** Correct! Because there’s more than people want, sellers lower prices to sell it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, okay. It makes sense now. But, um, what about equilibrium? I hear this word many time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Equilibrium is when supply equals demand. The market is balanced because the price is just right.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** So, price not go up or down when equilibrium?

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, it stays stable because the amount people want matches what’s available.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** How does, um, company know when it is equilibrium?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! They use market research to estimate demand and adjust supply. It's not always perfect.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I understand better now. Um, can I ask... what happens if demand suddenly change?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! If demand increases suddenly, prices might go up until supply catches up.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, like when new phone come out and everyone want it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! That's a perfect example of demand surge affecting prices.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you, this help me a lot. I feel more confident now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that, Hiroshi! Anytime you need help, just ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you. I will study more and maybe ask again.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! Keep up the great wo
