peaker A (NS):** Hi Yuki, thanks for meeting with me today. I heard there was a little mix-up with the project deadline. Could you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, hello. Um, I am very sorry. I think, how to say, I misunderstood the date. I thought it was next week, but it is, uh, this week.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. It's okay, mistakes happen. Can you explain what might have led to this misunderstanding?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, sure. I read the email, and I think I confused with another project. I need to be more, um, careful with schedule.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. It's easy to mix things up sometimes. Do you have a plan to get back on track?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will work more hours this week. Maybe, um, I stay late? And I finish by Friday.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. Make sure you also take care of yourself. Is there anything you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, I think I can manage, but, um, if you can check my work, it helps. To make sure no mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I can review it with you. Let’s set a time on Thursday to go over everything together.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you, very helpful. Thursday is good, um, maybe afternoon?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, how about 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, 2 p.m. is perfect. I will come prepared.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, looking forward to it. By the way, have you considered setting reminders to avoid such mix-ups in the future?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, good idea. I will use calendar more often, with alert. This will help, um, a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a smart approach. Technology can be very useful for keeping track of things.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I agree. Thank you for your advice, and sorry again for trouble.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all, Yuki. We all learn from our mistakes. Just keep up the good work.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I will, thank you. I feel more, um, confident now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that. Let’s make sure everything goes smoothly from here on out.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will do my best. And I see you on Thursday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, see you th
