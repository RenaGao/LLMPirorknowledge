peaker A (NS):** Hi Yuki, how have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I was thinking about cultural differences in dining etiquette. Have you noticed any since moving here?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, many. Um, in Japan, we say “Itadakimasu” before eating. Here, not so much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, “Itadakimasu” is like giving thanks before meals, correct?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, yes. It is polite way. Also, um, chopsticks... people here not use often.

**Speaker A (NS):** True, most people use forks and knives. Have you adjusted to using them?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, sometimes difficult. I still practice. But I like chopsticks best.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It's all about comfort, right? How about tipping? Is that different for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! In Japan, no tipping. Service fee included. Here, I must remember.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, tipping is customary here. Usually around 15-20% of the bill.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, I see. Um, also, slurping noodles... in Japan, okay. But here, not so okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right, slurping is seen as impolite here, though it shows appreciation in Japan.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes. I try to be quiet when eat noodle here. Little hard!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're doing great, Yuki. It's about adapting to each culture.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I learn new things every day. Like, drinking soup from bowl. In Japan, okay... here?

**Speaker A (NS):** Typically, people use spoons here, but direct from the bowl is fine for some dishes, like ramen.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. Thank you for explain. It helps a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Yuki. It's wonderful to learn about these differences together.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I agree. I enjoy talk about cultures. Thank you for your time.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. Let's chat more about it so
