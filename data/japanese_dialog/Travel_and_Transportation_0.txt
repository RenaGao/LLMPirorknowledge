peaker A (NS):** Hi there! How was your trip? You visited a new city, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, I went to, um, Osaka. It was my first time there.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds exciting! What did you do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see... many things. Um, I go to Osaka Castle. Very big and, uh, historical.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Osaka Castle! It’s a famous landmark. Did you enjoy the visit?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, very much. The view from top is beautiful. I take many pictures.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds amazing! Did you try any local food?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I eat... how to say... octopus ball?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you mean takoyaki?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, takoyaki! Very delicious. I also try okonomiyaki.

**Speaker A (NS):** You had quite the culinary adventure! How did you find traveling around the city?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I use subway. It is... convenient but little confusing at first.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! Did you use a map or an app to help?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I use app on phone. It tell me which train... um, to take.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s handy. Did you visit anywhere else besides the castle?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I go to Dotonbori. Very... lively, and many shops.

**Speaker A (NS):** Dotonbori is famous for its neon lights and street food! Did you buy anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I buy some souvenirs and gift for family. Small things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Lovely. How was the weather while you were there?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It was... sunny but also hot. I need... how to say... sunscreen?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sunscreen, yes. It’s important in the summer. Overall, did you enjoy your trip?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, very much! I want to go again. So much more to see.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear! Thanks for sharing your experience with
