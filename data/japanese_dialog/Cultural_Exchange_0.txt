peaker A (NS):** Hi there, Yuki! I was thinking, could you tell me about a Japanese tradition or festival? I’d love to learn more about your culture.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Of course, I can do that. Uh, maybe I talk about Tanabata? It is, um, a festival in July.

**Speaker A (NS):** Tanabata sounds interesting. What exactly happens during this festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** So, Tanabata is... how to say... star festival. We celebrate, um, two stars meeting in sky. They are lovers.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds romantic! How do people celebrate Tanabata?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, um, people write wishes on paper. We call it tanzaku. Then, we hang on bamboo.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What kind of wishes do people usually write?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Uh, many kind. Like, for good health, or... um, success in study. Children write, too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s lovely. Is there anything else people do during Tanabata?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, sometimes there are festival... uh, matsuri. With food stands and fireworks.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds fun! Is there a particular food associated with Tanabata?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, not special food for Tanabata, but we eat... uh, summer food. Like watermelon or noodles.

**Speaker A (NS):** I love watermelon! Do people wear special clothes for the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, some people wear yukata. It is, um, like kimono but for summer.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yukata, I think I’ve seen those. They look very beautiful. Do you wear one?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Uh, sometimes, yes. I wear when go to festival with my friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** It must be quite the experience. Does Tanabata have a particular story behind it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is story of two star lovers, Orihime and Hikoboshi. They meet once a year.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a beautiful story. How long have you celebrated Tanabata?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Since I was child. My family, um, always write wishes together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s such a nice tradition to keep. Thank you for sharing, Yuki. I learned a lot!
