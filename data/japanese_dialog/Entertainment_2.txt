peaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello, Sarah! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I was wondering if you’ve read any good books lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes. I read a book, how to say... very famous? It is called, uh, “Norwegian Wood” by Murakami.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, Haruki Murakami! He’s a wonderful author. Why do you recommend “Norwegian Wood”?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, it is... how to say... deep? It talks about life and, um, love in a way that is very... um, touching.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds intriguing. What did you find most interesting about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think, um, the characters are very... real? They have, uh, real problems and feel... how to say... alive.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great way to describe them. Did you have a favorite part of the book?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, there is a part, um, where they talk about music. I like music a lot, so it was... um, interesting to me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Music does play an important role in the story. Do you think it would be easy for someone who’s not familiar with Japanese culture to enjoy this book?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, maybe some parts are... how to say... a little difficult? But, the story is very... um, universal. Everyone can feel... um, connected?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true, the themes are quite universal. What would you say to someone who’s unsure about reading it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think, um, they should try. It is, uh, good for thinking and... um, feeling. Also, it is good practice for... um, reading English too if they use the translation.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely, reading translated literature can be a great way to learn. Have you read any other Murakami books?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I read “Kafka on the Shore.” It is also... um, strange but interesting. I like it too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That one is quite unique as well! What draws you to his books in general?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think, um, his world is very... um, how to say... different? It is like a... um, dream but real life.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a beautiful way of putting it. Would you like to read more of his work in the future?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to read, um, more. Maybe “1Q84”? I hear it is very... um, long but good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s another excellent choice. Well, thank you, Yuki, for your recommendation. I’ll definitely check it out.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you, Sarah. I hope you enjoy it! Let’s talk about it when you fini
