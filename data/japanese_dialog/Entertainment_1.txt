**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, I am free. What kind of, um, place do you want to go?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking maybe Italian or Japanese. Do you have a preference?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, I like both. But maybe Japanese food tonight, yes?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you soon! Thank you for planning.
