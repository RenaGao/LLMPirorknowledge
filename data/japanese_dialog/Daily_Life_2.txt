peaker A (NS):** Hi there! I heard you like cooking. Could you tell me how you prepare your favorite meal?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, I like cooking. My favorite is, um, curry rice. You know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I love curry rice! How do you usually make it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** First, I cut vegetables. Onion, potato, and... how you say... carrot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Carrot, yes. Do you use any meat?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I use chicken. I cut chicken into, um, small pieces.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. What’s the next step?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Then, I fry vegetables and chicken in pan. Use little oil. Uh, medium heat.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, and after they’re cooked, what do you do?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I add water... um, about two cups. And then, curry roux.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the curry roux! That’s what gives it flavor, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is important. Stir until roux is... um, how to say... melted?

**Speaker A (NS):** Melted, yes. Do you let it simmer for a while?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I let it simmer maybe ten minutes. Stir sometimes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you serve it with rice?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, of course. I cook rice in rice cooker. It is easy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any tips for making it taste better?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, sometimes I add soy sauce, just little. Makes taste good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice tip. Do you make it spicy?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not too spicy. My family like medium spicy. Um, balance is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you usually make curry rice for special occasions?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, sometimes. But also, I make when I miss home food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You’re welcome! I hope you can try it some ti
