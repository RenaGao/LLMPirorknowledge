**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie. Thanks for taking the time to chat. I wanted to talk about the mix-up with the project files last week.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, hey! Yeah, I’ve been meaning to discuss that. I’m really sorry about the confusion. I must have sent the wrong version by mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, these things happen. I appreciate you owning up to it. Do you have any thoughts on how we can avoid this in the future?

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely. I was thinking we could set up a shared folder with clear labels for each version. That way, we’re all on the same page.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a solid plan. Maybe we could also have a quick check-in before sending out the final files?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, that’s a great idea. A five-minute call could save us a lot of headaches down the line.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. And if you ever need a second pair of eyes on something, just give me a shout.

**Speaker B (NS):** I appreciate that. I’ll definitely take you up on it. By the way, how did the presentation go with the client?

**Speaker A (NS):** It went pretty well, all things considered. They were understanding about the delay, and they loved the final product.

**Speaker B (NS):** Phew, that’s a relief! I was worried it might have thrown a wrench in the works.

**Speaker A (NS):** Not at all. We managed to pull it off, and they were really impressed with the updates.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s great to hear. I’ll make sure to double-check everything next time to avoid any hiccups.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. I’m glad we could sort this out. Anything else on your mind?

**Speaker B (NS):** Not really, just wanted to make sure we’re all good. Thanks for being so understanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, Jamie. We’re a team, after all. Let’s keep the lines of communication open.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely. I’ll get started on setting up that shared folder today.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s touch base next week to see how it’s working out.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good. Thanks again for your patience.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Have a great rest of your day!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too, take care!
