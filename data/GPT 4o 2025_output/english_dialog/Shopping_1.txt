**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for coming with me to the market today. I’ve got my eye on that vintage lamp over there.

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem! I love a good market trip. That lamp does look pretty cool. Have you thought about how much you’re willing to spend?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I’m thinking around $50, but I’m not sure if that’s realistic. What do you think?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, it’s always worth a shot. You know, sometimes sellers are open to negotiation, especially if you’re polite and show genuine interest.

**Speaker A (NS):** True, I’ll give it a go. Do you have any tips for haggling? I’m not exactly a pro at this.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sure thing! Start by asking about the item’s history or any unique features. It shows you’re interested beyond just the price.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. I’ll ask about its background. Anything else I should keep in mind?

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely. Be ready to walk away if the price doesn’t budge. Sometimes that’s when they’ll lower it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. I’ll try to keep my poker face on. Let’s see how it goes.

**Speaker B (NS):** You’ve got this! I’ll be right here if you need backup.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks! Okay, here goes nothing. *[Approaches the seller]* Hi there, I’m really interested in this lamp. Can you tell me a bit about it?

**Speaker B (NS):** *[Listening from a distance]* You’re doing great. Keep it up!

**Speaker A (NS):** *[Returns]* So, the seller said it’s from the 1960s and in great condition. They’re asking $70, but I offered $50.

**Speaker B (NS):** Nice work! Did they counter your offer?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, they came down to $60. I think I might go for it. What do you think?

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s a fair compromise. If you love it and it fits your budget, I’d say go for it.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re right. I’ll take it. Thanks for the advice, it really helped!

**Speaker B (NS):** Anytime! I’m glad it worked out. Shall we grab a coffee to celebrate your new find?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect. Let’s do it. Thanks again for your help today.

**Speaker B (NS):** No worries, it was fun! Let’s head over to that café we passed earlier.
