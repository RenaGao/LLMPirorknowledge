**Speaker A (Manager):** Hi, Jamie! Thanks for stopping by. How's everything going with the project?

**Speaker B (Jamie):** Hey! It's going well, but I wanted to chat about the deadline. I think we might need a bit more time to polish things up.

**Speaker A (Manager):** I see. Can you walk me through what's causing the delay? Maybe we can brainstorm some solutions together.

**Speaker B (Jamie):** Sure thing. We've hit a few snags with the new software integration. It's taking longer than expected to get everything running smoothly.

**Speaker A (Manager):** That's understandable. New tech can be a bit of a wild card. Have you considered reaching out to the vendor for support?

**Speaker B (Jamie):** Yeah, we did, but their response time is slower than molasses in January. We're trying to work around it in the meantime.

**Speaker A (Manager):** That's frustrating. Maybe we can allocate some extra resources to help speed things up. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (Jamie):** That would be fantastic. I think with a couple more hands on deck, we could make up for lost time.

**Speaker A (Manager):** Great. I'll see what I can do about that. In the meantime, let's set a new deadline. How much extra time do you think you'll need?

**Speaker B (Jamie):** I think an additional week should do the trick. That way, we can ensure everything's up to snuff.

**Speaker A (Manager):** A week sounds reasonable. Let's aim for that, but keep me in the loop if anything else crops up.

**Speaker B (Jamie):** Will do. I really appreciate your understanding and support on this.

**Speaker A (Manager):** No problem at all. We're all in the same boat, and it's important to get it right.

**Speaker B (Jamie):** Absolutely. I'll keep pushing forward and update you regularly.

**Speaker A (Manager):** Perfect. Thanks for being proactive about this, Jamie. It makes a world of difference.

**Speaker B (Jamie):** Thanks for your help, too. It's good to know I've got your backing.

**Speaker A (Manager):** Anytime. Let's touch base again next week to see how things are shaping up.

**Speaker B (Jamie):** Sounds like a plan. I'll make sure to have some progress to report.

**Speaker A (Manager):** Looking forward to it. Have a great rest of your day!

**Speaker B (Jamie):** You too! Thanks again, and talk soon!
