**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie! Thanks for meeting up. I wanted to clear the air about what happened last weekend.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, hey! Yeah, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that. I felt like there was a bit of a mix-up.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. I think we might have gotten our wires crossed. I didn’t mean to leave you hanging at the café.

**Speaker B (NS):** I figured something must have come up. I was just a bit confused when you didn’t show up.

**Speaker A (NS):** Totally understandable. I should have called. I got caught up with a family thing and lost track of time.

**Speaker B (NS):** No worries, life happens. I just wish I’d known so I could’ve planned my day better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, and I’m really sorry about that. How about we reschedule? My treat this time.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds great! I’d love to catch up properly. Maybe this weekend?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s do Saturday afternoon. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (NS):** Saturday works like a charm. I’m glad we sorted this out. I didn’t want any bad blood between us.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me neither. I value our friendship too much to let a little misunderstanding get in the way.

**Speaker B (NS):** Same here. It’s good to know we can talk things through. Communication is key, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. I’ll make sure to keep you in the loop next time. Thanks for being so understanding.

**Speaker B (NS):** Anytime. We all have our moments. I’m just glad we’re on the same page now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. I’ll see you on Saturday then. Looking forward to it!

**Speaker B (NS):** Me too! Thanks for reaching out, and have a great rest of your week.

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Jamie. Take care and see you soon!

**Speaker B (NS):** Bye for now!
