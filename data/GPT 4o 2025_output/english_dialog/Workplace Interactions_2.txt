**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for jumping on this call. I thought it’d be good to plan our team meeting for next week. 

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem, happy to help. So, what do you think should be on the agenda?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I was thinking we could start with a quick round of updates from everyone. You know, just to get the ball rolling.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds like a solid start. Maybe we could also include a segment on project timelines? It seems like a few deadlines are creeping up on us.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good point. We definitely need to keep everyone in the loop on that. How about we also carve out some time for brainstorming new ideas?

**Speaker B (NS):** I like that. It’s always good to get the creative juices flowing. Do you think we should set aside time for any specific team-building activities?

**Speaker A (NS):** Hmm, that’s a great idea. Maybe something light and fun to break the ice. Any suggestions?

**Speaker B (NS):** We could do a quick trivia game or a short virtual coffee break. It’s a nice way to keep things lively.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll add that to the agenda. Do you think we should wrap up with a Q&A session?

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely. It’s always good to give everyone a chance to voice any concerns or questions.

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. So, to recap, we’ll start with updates, discuss project timelines, have a brainstorming session, do a team-building activity, and finish with a Q&A.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Should we send out a draft agenda to the team for feedback?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s a good idea. I’ll draft it up and send it over by tomorrow. Anything else we should consider?

**Speaker B (NS):** I think we’ve covered all the bases. Just make sure to include the meeting link in the invite.

**Speaker A (NS):** Will do. Thanks for your input, it’s always great to bounce ideas off you.

**Speaker B (NS):** No worries, happy to help. Let’s touch base again if anything else comes up.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. I’ll keep you posted. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! Talk soon. Bye!
