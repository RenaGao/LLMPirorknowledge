**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie! Are you ready for the big exam next week?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, hey! Honestly, I'm feeling a bit on edge about it. There's just so much to cover, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** I hear you. It's a lot to take in. Have you started reviewing the material yet?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, I've been going through my notes, but I feel like I'm just scratching the surface. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I've been trying to tackle it bit by bit. Breaking it down into smaller chunks seems to help. Have you tried any study groups?

**Speaker B (NS):** Not yet, but that's a good idea. I think discussing with others might help things stick better. Are you in one?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, a few of us meet up after class. You're more than welcome to join. We usually go over key concepts and quiz each other.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds perfect! I could definitely use some quizzing. What time do you guys usually meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** We meet around 4 PM in the library. It's pretty laid-back, and we try to keep it fun.

**Speaker B (NS):** Awesome, I'll be there. I think having a bit of structure will really help me focus.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Plus, it's always good to bounce ideas off each other. Sometimes someone else’s perspective can make things click.

**Speaker B (NS):** True, and I could use all the help I can get. Do you have any tips for managing stress during the exam?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I try to get a good night's sleep before the exam and take deep breaths if I start feeling overwhelmed. It’s all about keeping a cool head.

**Speaker B (NS):** That makes sense. I tend to overthink, so I’ll definitely try to keep calm. Thanks for the advice!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. We’re all in the same boat, right? Just remember, you've got this!

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks, I really appreciate it. I feel a bit more at ease now. I’ll see you at the study group then?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Looking forward to it. Let’s ace this exam together.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Thanks again for the invite. Catch you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! Take care, Jamie. See you soon!
