**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sarah! It's been ages since we last spoke. How have you been?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, hey, Tom! I know, right? Time flies. I've been doing well, just keeping busy with work and the kids. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here, just juggling work and trying to find some time for myself. Speaking of which, I heard you started a new job recently. How's that going?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, I did! It's been a bit of a whirlwind, to be honest. The learning curve is steep, but I'm getting the hang of it. You know how it is, new job jitters and all.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I’ve been there. It’s like drinking from a fire hose at first, but you’ll settle in soon enough. What exactly are you doing now?

**Speaker B (NS):** I'm working in marketing for a tech company. It's a lot of data analysis and strategy planning, which is new for me, but exciting. What about you? Still at the same place?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yep, still at the same company. I’ve been thinking about a change, though. Maybe something that lets me travel more. Any tips from your recent experience?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, I’d say go for it if you feel the itch. Change can be daunting, but it’s also refreshing. Just make sure to weigh the pros and cons, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good advice. I’ll definitely keep that in mind. So, how are the kids doing? They must be growing up fast!

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, they are! It's like they sprout overnight. Emma just started high school, and Jake is already in middle school. They keep me on my toes, that’s for sure.

**Speaker A (NS):** I bet! It must be a handful, but also rewarding. Do they have any new hobbies or interests?

**Speaker B (NS):** Emma's really into photography now, and Jake's all about soccer. It's great to see them passionate about something. How about your family?

**Speaker A (NS):** Everyone's doing well. My son just started playing the guitar, and my daughter is into painting. It’s amazing to watch them explore their creativity.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s wonderful! It sounds like they’re really thriving. We should get the families together sometime soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that. Maybe we can plan a weekend get-together before the holidays hit. It’d be great to catch up in person.

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely, let’s pencil something in. I’ll check our schedule and get back to you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Well, I should probably let you go. It was so nice catching up, Sarah.

**Speaker B (NS):** Likewise, Tom. Let’s not wait so long to chat next time. Take care!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Talk soon, and give my best to everyone.

**Speaker B (NS):** Will do. Bye for now!
