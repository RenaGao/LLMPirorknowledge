**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie! Thanks for meeting up. I wanted to clear the air about what happened last weekend.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, hey! Yeah, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that. I felt like there was a bit of a mix-up.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. I think we might have gotten our wires crossed. I didn’t mean to leave you hanging at the café.

**Speaker B (NS):** No worries. I figured something must have come up. I was just a bit confused when I didn’t hear from you.

**Speaker A (NS):** I totally get that. My phone died, and I couldn’t get in touch. I should have planned better.

**Speaker B (NS):** It happens to the best of us. I was just worried something might have been wrong.

**Speaker A (NS):** I appreciate your concern. I should have been more prepared. How about we reschedule our coffee date?

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds great! I’d love to catch up properly. Maybe this Saturday?

**Speaker A (NS):** Saturday works for me. Let’s make it a plan. I’ll make sure my phone is fully charged this time!

**Speaker B (NS):** Perfect! And hey, thanks for reaching out to clear things up. It means a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, Jamie. I value our friendship too much to let a little misunderstanding get in the way.

**Speaker B (NS):** Same here. It’s good to know we can talk things through.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Communication is key, right? 

**Speaker B (NS):** You bet. I’m glad we sorted this out. Looking forward to Saturday!

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. It’ll be nice to relax and chat without any hiccups.

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely. Thanks again for being so understanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime. I’ll see you on Saturday then!

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Take care until then!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Jamie. Bye for now!

**Speaker B (NS):** Bye!
