**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, it's great to catch up! So, what are your goals for the next year?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey! Yeah, I've been thinking about that a lot lately. I really want to focus on improving my health and maybe even run a marathon. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds ambitious! For me, I’m aiming to advance my career, maybe take on a leadership role. How do you plan to tackle the marathon goal?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, I’m starting with small steps, literally. I’ve joined a local running club to keep me motivated. What about your career goals? Any specific steps in mind?

**Speaker A (NS):** Joining a club is a great idea! For my career, I’m planning to take a few online courses to build up my skills. You know, gotta keep the ball rolling.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely, staying ahead of the curve is key. Do you have any particular courses in mind?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m looking at some leadership and project management courses. I think they’ll really help me step up my game. How about you? Any other goals besides the marathon?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, I’d like to travel more, maybe explore a new country. It’s been on my bucket list for ages. Do you have any travel plans?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds exciting! I’d love to visit Japan. It’s been a dream of mine for a while. What’s your top destination?

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m thinking Italy. The culture, the food—what’s not to love, right? How do you plan to balance work and travel?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m hoping to use my vacation days wisely and maybe work remotely for a bit. It’s all about finding that sweet spot. How about you?

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m planning to save up and maybe take a longer break. It’s all about making it work, you know? Any tips on staying motivated with your goals?

**Speaker A (NS):** I find setting small, achievable milestones really helps. It keeps me on track without feeling overwhelmed. What about you?

**Speaker B (NS):** I agree, celebrating small wins is key. Plus, having a buddy to keep you accountable makes a world of difference.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely, having someone to share the journey with is invaluable. Well, it sounds like we both have exciting plans ahead!
