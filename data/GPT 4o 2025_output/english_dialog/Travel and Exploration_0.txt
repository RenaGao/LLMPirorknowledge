**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for meeting up! I heard you were thinking about planning a trip with some friends. Where are you guys thinking of going?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, we’re actually considering heading to Austin. I've heard it's a pretty vibrant city with lots to do. Have you ever been?

**Speaker A (NS):** I have! Austin's a fantastic choice. The live music scene is off the charts, and the food is to die for. What are you guys hoping to do there?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, we definitely want to check out some live music venues. And, of course, try some authentic Texan barbecue. Any must-see spots you’d recommend?

**Speaker A (NS):** For sure! You can't miss Sixth Street for the nightlife. And for barbecue, Franklin Barbecue is legendary, though you might have to queue up for a bit.

**Speaker B (NS):** Good to know! I’ll make sure we get there early. What about outdoor activities? I heard there are some nice parks and trails.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, you should check out Zilker Park. It's perfect for a picnic or just hanging out. And if you’re up for a bit of a hike, the Barton Creek Greenbelt is beautiful.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds perfect. I’ll add those to our itinerary. Do you think we should rent a car, or is public transport good enough?

**Speaker A (NS):** It depends on how much you want to explore outside the city. Public transport is decent, but having a car gives you more flexibility, especially if you want to visit places like the Hill Country.

**Speaker B (NS):** Makes sense. I’ll discuss it with the group. By the way, any tips on where to stay? We’re looking for something budget-friendly but comfortable.

**Speaker A (NS):** You might want to look into Airbnb options. There are some great places in South Congress that are both affordable and close to the action.

**Speaker B (NS):** Great idea! I’ll check that out. Thanks for all the tips. I feel like we’re going to have an amazing trip.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I’m sure you’ll have a blast. Austin’s one of those places that just has something for everyone.

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m really looking forward to it now. Thanks again for all your help. Maybe we can catch up after the trip, and I’ll tell you all about it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Safe travels, and have an awesome time. Let’s definitely catch up when you’re back.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Thanks again, and take care!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Bye for now!
