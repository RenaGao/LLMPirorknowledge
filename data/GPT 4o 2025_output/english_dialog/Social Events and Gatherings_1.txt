**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for meeting up! I wanted to chat about planning a surprise party for Sarah. Are you in?

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely, I'm all in! Sarah's been such a great friend, and she deserves something special. Do you have any ideas in mind?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking of throwing it at her favorite café. They have that cozy back room we could reserve. What do you think?

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds perfect! She loves that place. Do you think we should go with a theme, or keep it simple?

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe something low-key, like a "throwback" theme with some of her favorite music from college. It’ll be a blast from the past!

**Speaker B (NS):** I love it! We could even make a playlist with all those old hits. Do you think we should handle the decorations ourselves?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I think we can manage that. A few balloons, some streamers, and maybe a photo collage of fun memories. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan! I can take care of the photo collage. Do you want to handle the invites?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure thing. I'll set up a group chat to keep it under wraps. We should probably keep the guest list to her closest friends, right?

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely. We don't want to overwhelm her. What about food and drinks? Should we cater or DIY?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let's do a mix. We can order some of her favorite snacks and maybe bake a cake ourselves. She loves homemade stuff.

**Speaker B (NS):** Great idea! I can help with the baking. Do you think we should have any games or activities planned?

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe a trivia game about Sarah? It could be a fun way to share stories and memories.

**Speaker B (NS):** That's brilliant! I can come up with some questions. When do you think we should have the party?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about next Saturday? It gives us enough time to get everything together, and I know she’s free that evening.

**Speaker B (NS):** Perfect! I’ll start working on the playlist and the trivia questions. Anything else we need to cover?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think we’ve got it all sorted. I’ll handle the invites and decorations. Let’s touch base mid-week to make sure everything’s on track.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good to me. I’m really excited about this! Sarah’s going to be over the moon.

**Speaker A (NS):** I know, right? Thanks for teaming up on this. Let’s make it a night to remember.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely! I’ll catch you later this week. Take care!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Bye for now!
