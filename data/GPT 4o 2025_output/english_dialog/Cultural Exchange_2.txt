**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sarah! I was curious, what's your favorite holiday here in the States?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, that's a tough one! But if I had to pick, I'd say Thanksgiving. There's just something about gathering with family and friends, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, Thanksgiving is such a warm holiday. Is it the food, the company, or something else that makes it your favorite?

**Speaker B (NS):** It's a bit of everything, really. I love the foodâ€”turkey, stuffing, and all the fixings. But it's also the chance to slow down and reflect on what I'm grateful for.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. It's nice to have a holiday focused on gratitude. Do you have any special traditions you follow?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, my family always starts the day with a big breakfast, and then we watch the parade on TV. Later, we all pitch in to cook dinner. It's a real team effort!

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun. I bet the kitchen gets pretty lively with everyone involved.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, for sure! It's a bit chaotic, but that's part of the charm. How about you? Do you have a favorite holiday?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think I'd have to go with Christmas. I love the festive spirit and all the decorations. Plus, it's a great excuse to indulge in some holiday treats.

**Speaker B (NS):** Christmas is wonderful, too. There's something magical about the lights and the music. Do you have any traditions you look forward to?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. My family always goes caroling in the neighborhood, and we have a big Christmas Eve dinner. It's a time to reconnect and enjoy each other's company.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds lovely. It's nice how holidays bring people together, isn't it?

**Speaker A (NS):** It really is. I think that's what makes them so special. Thanks for sharing your Thanksgiving traditions with me, Sarah.

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem, I enjoyed hearing about your Christmas traditions, too. It's always nice to learn about how others celebrate.

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. Let's catch up again soon and maybe swap some holiday recipes!

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds like a plan. Take care, and have a great day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Sarah. Goodbye!
