**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, hey! Yeah, I could use some help. I'm trying to find the Maplewood Hotel. Do you know where it is?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I know the place. You're not too far off, actually. Do you have a map or GPS with you?

**Speaker B (NS):** I do, but it's acting up a bit. You know how technology can be sometimes. Could you maybe give me some directions?

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. So, you’ll want to head straight down this street for about two blocks. Then, take a left at the traffic lights.

**Speaker B (NS):** Got it. Straight for two blocks, then a left at the lights. What next?

**Speaker A (NS):** After you turn, keep going until you hit the roundabout. The hotel should be just on your right, you can't miss it.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds straightforward enough. Thanks a million! I was starting to feel like a fish out of water here.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, happy to help. Are you visiting for business or pleasure?

**Speaker B (NS):** A bit of both, actually. I have a conference to attend, but I’m hoping to squeeze in some sightseeing too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good mix. If you have time, the local museum is worth a visit. It's just a stone's throw from the hotel.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, that sounds interesting! I’ll definitely check it out if I can. Thanks for the tip.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! If you need any more help, just holler. I’m usually around this area.

**Speaker B (NS):** I appreciate that. You've been a lifesaver today. I should get going before it gets too late.

**Speaker A (NS):** Safe travels! Enjoy your stay and the conference.

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks again! I’ll try to make the most of it. Take care!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Have a great day and goodbye!

**Speaker B (NS):** Goodbye!
