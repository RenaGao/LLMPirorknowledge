**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie! Are you ready for the big test coming up next week?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, hey! Honestly, I'm a bit nervous about it. There's so much to cover, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** I hear you. It feels like we're trying to drink from a fire hose with all this material. Have you started reviewing yet?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, I started going over my notes last night, but I feel like I'm just scratching the surface. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I've been trying to break it down into smaller chunks. You know what they say, "Rome wasn't built in a day." 

**Speaker B (NS):** That's a good approach. I tend to cram, but I know it's not the best strategy. Any tips on how to tackle the material?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I've found that making flashcards really helps. It’s like having a mini quiz every time I go through them.

**Speaker B (NS):** Flashcards, huh? I might give that a shot. Do you use any apps for that, or just the old-school paper ones?

**Speaker A (NS):** I actually use an app. It's super handy because I can review them anywhere, even on the bus.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds convenient. I guess I should start using my phone for more than just scrolling through social media.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! And maybe we could study together sometime? Two heads are better than one, right?

**Speaker B (NS):** I’d love that! We could quiz each other and fill in the gaps. When are you free?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this weekend? We can meet at the library and make a day of it.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. I’ll bring some snacks to keep us fueled.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And if we get stuck, we can always ask each other for help. No need to reinvent the wheel.

**Speaker B (NS):** True, and it’ll be nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of. Thanks for suggesting this.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I’m sure we’ll both feel more prepared after a good study session.

**Speaker B (NS):** Agreed. I’m feeling better about the test already. Thanks for the pep talk!

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Jamie. Let’s ace this test together!

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely! See you this weekend, and take care until then.

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Bye for now!
