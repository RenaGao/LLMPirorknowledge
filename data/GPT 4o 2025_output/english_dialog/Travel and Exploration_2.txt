**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, hey! Yeah, I could use some help. I'm trying to find the old lighthouse. I heard it's a must-see around here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, it's a great spot. You're not too far off, actually. Do you have a map, or are you using your phone for directions?

**Speaker B (NS):** I'm using my phone, but, um, the signal's a bit spotty. Could you maybe give me some old-school directions?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure thing! So, you want to head straight down this street until you hit the big oak tree. You can't miss itâ€”it's the only one with a bench underneath.

**Speaker B (NS):** Got it. Big oak tree with a bench. Then what?

**Speaker A (NS):** Once you reach the tree, take a left. You'll pass a small bakery on your right. They make the best croissants, by the way, if you're feeling peckish.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, that sounds tempting! I'll keep that in mind. And after the bakery?

**Speaker A (NS):** Keep going straight until you see the sign for the coastal path. Follow that path, and it'll lead you right to the lighthouse. It's about a ten-minute walk from there.

**Speaker B (NS):** Perfect, that sounds straightforward. Thanks a million for the help!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. It's always nice to help out a fellow traveler. Are you visiting for long?

**Speaker B (NS):** Just a couple of days. I'm trying to squeeze in as much as I can, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** I hear you. Well, the lighthouse is a great choice. The view from up there is worth the trek.

**Speaker B (NS):** I'm really looking forward to it. Thanks again for the directions and the tip about the bakery.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! Enjoy your visit, and if you need more help, just holler.

**Speaker B (NS):** Will do. Thanks for being so friendly. Have a great day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Take care and enjoy the lighthouse.

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks, I will. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Safe travels!
