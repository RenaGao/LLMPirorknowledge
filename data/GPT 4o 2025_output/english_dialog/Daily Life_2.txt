**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for taking the time to chat. I heard you’re quite the cook. What’s your favorite meal to prepare?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, thanks! I love making homemade lasagna. It’s a bit of a process, but totally worth it. Do you like Italian food?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I’m a big fan. So, what’s your secret to a great lasagna?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, I start with a rich meat sauce. I let it simmer for a couple of hours to really bring out the flavors. You know, slow and steady wins the race.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious. Do you make your own pasta, or do you use store-bought?

**Speaker B (NS):** I usually go with store-bought for convenience, but I make sure to get the fresh sheets from the deli. It’s a game-changer, trust me.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll have to try that. How about the cheese? Do you have a special blend?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, definitely. I mix ricotta with a bit of parmesan and mozzarella. It’s all about getting that perfect creamy texture.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yum, I can almost taste it. Do you add any veggies, or is it strictly meat and cheese?

**Speaker B (NS):** I like to throw in some spinach for a bit of color and nutrition. It’s a nice way to sneak in some greens.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. How long does it take to bake?

**Speaker B (NS):** About 45 minutes in the oven, then I let it rest for a bit. It’s hard to wait, but patience is a virtue, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** For sure. It sounds like you’ve got it down to a science. Do you make it often?

**Speaker B (NS):** I try to, especially when I have friends over. It’s a real crowd-pleaser. Maybe I can make it for us sometime?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! I’ll bring dessert. Any preferences?

**Speaker B (NS):** Anything chocolate works for me. You can’t go wrong with a classic.

**Speaker A (NS):** Chocolate it is, then. I’m looking forward to it. Thanks for sharing your recipe tips!

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem at all. I’m glad you’re interested. Let’s set a date soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Thanks again, and have a great day!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! Catch you later!
