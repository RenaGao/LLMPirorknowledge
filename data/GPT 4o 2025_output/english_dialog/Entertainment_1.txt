**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for meeting up! I was thinking we could plan an evening out. Any ideas on where to start?

**Speaker B (NS):** Sure thing! I’ve been itching to try that new Italian place downtown. Have you heard anything about it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean Bella Vita? I’ve heard it’s the bee’s knees! Apparently, their pasta is to die for.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds perfect! I’m always up for some good pasta. Do you think we should make a reservation, or just wing it?

**Speaker A (NS):** It might be wise to book a table. You know how popular new spots can get. I’ll give them a ring later.

**Speaker B (NS):** Great idea. So, what about after dinner? Should we catch a movie or maybe hit up that jazz club?

**Speaker A (NS):** Hmm, both sound tempting. I’ve been meaning to check out that jazz club. I hear they have live music every Friday night.

**Speaker B (NS):** Live music sounds like a blast! Plus, it’s been ages since I’ve been to a jazz club. Let’s do that.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! It’ll be a nice change of pace. Do you want to meet at the restaurant, or should we carpool?

**Speaker B (NS):** Let’s carpool. It’ll save us the hassle of finding parking twice. I can swing by and pick you up around six?

**Speaker A (NS):** Six works for me. I’ll be ready and waiting. Oh, and should we dress up a bit, or keep it casual?

**Speaker B (NS):** Maybe smart casual? That way, we’re covered for both the restaurant and the club.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. I’m really looking forward to this. It’s been too long since we had a proper night out.

**Speaker B (NS):** I know, right? It’ll be great to catch up and enjoy some good food and music.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Thanks for helping plan this. I think it’s going to be a fantastic evening.

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem at all. I’m glad we could sort it out. Let’s make it a night to remember!

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. I’ll see you at six then. Have a great rest of your day!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! Looking forward to it. Bye for now!
