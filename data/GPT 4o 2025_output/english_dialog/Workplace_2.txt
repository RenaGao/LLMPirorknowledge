**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, welcome to the team! How are you settling in so far?

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks! I'm doing well, just trying to get the lay of the land, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Totally understand. Starting a new job can feel like drinking from a fire hose. Do you have any questions about your tasks?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, actually. I was hoping you could walk me through the process for the monthly report. I want to make sure I’m not missing anything.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! The monthly report is pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it. First, you'll need to gather data from the sales and marketing teams.

**Speaker B (NS):** Got it. And do I just email them for the data, or is there a shared drive?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. We have a shared drive where they upload everything by the 5th of each month. I’ll send you the link after this chat.

**Speaker B (NS):** Perfect, that’ll be really helpful. What’s the next step after collecting the data?

**Speaker A (NS):** Once you have all the data, you’ll need to analyze it and create a summary. We usually focus on trends and any significant changes from the previous month.

**Speaker B (NS):** Okay, that makes sense. Is there a specific format I should follow for the summary?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we have a template for that. I’ll share it with you. It’s pretty user-friendly, so you shouldn’t have any trouble.

**Speaker B (NS):** Awesome, thanks! And how about the deadline? When does the report need to be finalized?

**Speaker A (NS):** We aim to have it ready by the 10th, so it gives us a couple of days to review and make any necessary tweaks.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds doable. I appreciate you breaking it down for me. Anything else I should keep in mind?

**Speaker A (NS):** Just remember to double-check the figures for accuracy. It’s always better to measure twice and cut once, as they say.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely, I’ll make sure to do that. Thanks for all the tips!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I’m here if you need any more help. We’re all in the same boat, after all.

**Speaker B (NS):** I really appreciate it. I feel a lot more confident about tackling the report now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Glad to hear it! Let’s touch base next week to see how things are going.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Thanks again for your help today.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! Have a great rest of your day.

**Speaker B (NS):** You too—take care!
