**Speaker A (Teacher):** Hi there! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (Student):** Hi! I was hoping you could clarify a few things about the assignment due next week. I'm a bit confused about the requirements.

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Of course, I'd be happy to help. What specifically are you unsure about?

**Speaker B (Student):** Well, the part about the research component. Do we need to include primary sources, or are secondary sources enough?

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Good question. For this assignment, you should focus on secondary sources. However, if you find a primary source that really supports your argument, feel free to include it.

**Speaker B (Student):** Got it. That makes sense. And about the word count, is there any leeway if we go a bit over?

**Speaker A (Teacher):** We do have a bit of wiggle room, but try to keep it within 10% of the limit. It's more about being concise and to the point.

**Speaker B (Student):** Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Also, I wanted to ask about the presentation format. Are we expected to use PowerPoint, or can we choose another method?

**Speaker A (Teacher):** You're free to choose any format that you feel comfortable with. Just make sure it's clear and engaging for your audience.

**Speaker B (Student):** Perfect, thanks! I think I'll try something a bit different this time. Maybe a video presentation.

**Speaker A (Teacher):** That sounds like a great idea! Just make sure to test it beforehand to avoid any technical hiccups.

**Speaker B (Student):** Will do. Thanks for the tip. One last thingâ€”how should we submit the assignment? Is it through email or the online portal?

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Please submit it through the online portal. It helps keep everything organized and ensures I don't miss anything.

**Speaker B (Student):** Alright, I'll make sure to do that. Thanks so much for clearing things up.

**Speaker A (Teacher):** No problem at all. I'm glad I could help. Do you feel more confident about the assignment now?

**Speaker B (Student):** Definitely. I really appreciate your guidance. It's always helpful to get a bit of direction.

**Speaker A (Teacher):** I'm glad to hear that. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

**Speaker B (Student):** I will, thanks again. I'll get started on it right away.

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Great! I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (Student):** You too! Thanks and goodbye!
