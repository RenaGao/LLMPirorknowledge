**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for meeting up today! I was really curious to hear about that festival you mentioned last time.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, sure! I’d love to tell you about it. It’s called Diwali, and it’s a big deal in my family. Have you heard of it before?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I’ve heard bits and pieces, but I’d love to know more. What’s it all about?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, Diwali is the Festival of Lights. It’s celebrated by millions of people around the world, and it symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds beautiful. How do you usually celebrate it?

**Speaker B (NS):** We do a lot of things! We clean and decorate the house, light oil lamps, and set off fireworks. It’s also a time for family gatherings and delicious food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, it sounds like a real feast for the senses. What’s your favorite part of the celebration?

**Speaker B (NS):** Honestly, it’s the family time. Everyone comes together, and there’s this warm, joyful atmosphere. Plus, the sweets are to die for!

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! Do you have any special traditions within your family?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, we always start the day with a small prayer ceremony, and then we exchange gifts. It’s a nice way to show appreciation for each other.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really lovely. It must be a great way to strengthen family bonds.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely. It’s like hitting the reset button and starting fresh with positive vibes.

**Speaker A (NS):** I love that idea. It’s like a new beginning every year. Do you think I could join you for Diwali sometime?

**Speaker B (NS):** Of course! We’d love to have you. The more, the merrier, as they say.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d really enjoy that. Thanks for the invite! I’ll bring some sweets to share.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds perfect. I’m sure you’ll have a blast.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m looking forward to it. Thanks for sharing all this with me. It’s fascinating to learn about different traditions.

**Speaker B (NS):** My pleasure! I’m glad you’re interested. It’s always fun to share a piece of my culture.

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s definitely plan for me to join next time. Until then, take care!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! Have a great day, and we’ll catch up soon. Goodbye!
