**Speaker A (Teacher):** Hi there! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (Student):** Hey! I was hoping you could clarify something about the homework assignment. I’m a bit confused about the second question.

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Of course! What specifically is tripping you up about that question?

**Speaker B (Student):** Well, it asks us to analyze the themes in the novel, but I’m not sure how detailed you want us to be. Should we focus on just one theme or cover multiple?

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Good question. I’d suggest focusing on two or three key themes. That way, you can explore them in depth without spreading yourself too thin.

**Speaker B (Student):** Got it. And when you say "in depth," do you mean we should include examples from the text?

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Exactly. Use specific examples to support your analysis. It’s like adding meat to the bones of your argument, you know?

**Speaker B (Student):** That makes sense. I’ll make sure to include some quotes, then. Is there a particular format you prefer for the essay?

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Just stick to the usual format we’ve been using: introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. Keep it clear and concise.

**Speaker B (Student):** Perfect. Thanks for clearing that up. I was also wondering about the word count. Is there a minimum or maximum?

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Aim for around 1,000 words. It’s enough to cover the material without going overboard.

**Speaker B (Student):** Alright, I think I’ve got a handle on it now. Thanks for your help!

**Speaker A (Teacher):** No problem at all. If you hit any more snags, feel free to reach out.

**Speaker B (Student):** Will do. I really appreciate your guidance.

**Speaker A (Teacher):** Anytime! I’m glad I could help. Good luck with the assignment.

**Speaker B (Student):** Thanks! I’ll get started on it right away. Have a great day!

**Speaker A (Teacher):** You too! Take care and see you in class.

**Speaker B (Student):** See you then! Goodbye!
