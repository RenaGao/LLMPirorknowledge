**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for meeting up! So, we need to brainstorm some ideas for Sarah's birthday surprise. Any thoughts?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, I've been thinking about it. You know how she loves the outdoors? Maybe we could organize a picnic at that park she likes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea! We could set up a nice spot with some fairy lights and blankets. Do you think we should invite just close friends or make it a bigger gathering?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hmm, I think keeping it small and intimate would be more her style. Plus, it’s easier to manage. What do you think about the food situation?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good point. We could do a potluck style, where everyone brings a dish. That way, we have a variety and it’s less work for any one person.

**Speaker B (NS):** I like that. And maybe we could have a little cake-cutting ceremony. She loves chocolate, so a chocolate cake is a must.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, chocolate it is! Should we plan any activities or games to keep things lively?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, maybe some classic games like charades or a scavenger hunt. Something that gets everyone involved and laughing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And what about a gift? Should we all chip in for something special?

**Speaker B (NS):** I was thinking the same. Maybe we could get her that art set she’s been eyeing. It’s a bit pricey, but if we all pitch in, it’s doable.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a fantastic idea. She’ll love it. Do you think we should keep the whole thing a secret until the day of?

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely. The element of surprise will make it even more special. We just need to make sure she’s free that day without giving anything away.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, maybe we can have her sister help with that. She can make sure Sarah doesn’t make other plans.

**Speaker B (NS):** Good thinking. I’ll touch base with her sister and coordinate. Anything else we need to cover?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think we’ve got the main points down. Let’s just make sure everyone’s on the same page with the plan.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. I’m really excited about this. Sarah’s going to be over the moon!

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Thanks for your input. Let’s catch up again soon to finalize everything.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely. Thanks for organizing this. Talk to you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye for now!
