**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey, Xiao Li! Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Um, hello! This weekend, I think... not busy. You have idea?

**Speaker A:** Great! I was thinking of going to the park. The weather is supposed to be nice. Would you like to join?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes! Park is good. What we do there?

**Speaker A:** We could ride bikes or maybe have a picnic. What do you think?

**Speaker B:** Ah, ride bike... and picnic. Sounds good! But, um, where we get bike?

**Speaker A:** There’s a place to rent bikes at the park entrance. I’ve been there before. It’s easy.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. I understand. We meet what time?

**Speaker A:** How about 10 a.m. on Saturday?

**Speaker B:** Ten a.m. is good. I will be there. Um, what we bring for picnic?

**Speaker A:** Maybe some sandwiches, fruits, and drinks? I can bring a blanket.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I bring... um, how to say... snacks and juice.

**Speaker A:** Perfect! Do you need help with anything else?

**Speaker B:** No, I think is okay. Thank you for ask.

**Speaker A:** No problem! I’m looking forward to it. Anything else you want to do?

**Speaker B:** Maybe, um, we can play... ball game? Like, uh, soccer?

**Speaker A:** Sure, we can bring a soccer ball. That sounds fun!

**Speaker B:** Yes, very fun! I like play soccer.

**Speaker A:** Awesome! So, we’ll meet at the park entrance at 10 a.m. on Saturday.

**Speaker B:** Yes, see you then! Thank you for plan.

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome, Xiao Li. See you this weekend!

**Speaker B:** Okay, see you! Goodbye!
