**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! I wanted to talk to you about the report you submitted yesterday.

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Oh, yes. Um, is there a problem with it?

**Speaker A:** Well, there was a small mistake in the data section. It seems like some numbers were mixed up.

**Speaker B:** Ah, I see. I am sorry for that. I think I, um, maybe put wrong number in table.

**Speaker A:** No worries, it happens. Do you know how you might fix it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can check the data again and, um, correct the mistake. I will do it today.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a good plan. Do you need any help with it?

**Speaker B:** Thank you, but I think I can do it. If I have question, I will ask you.

**Speaker A:** Sure, feel free to reach out. When do you think you can have the revised report ready?

**Speaker B:** I think, um, by tomorrow morning. Is that okay?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that works perfectly. Thank you for handling this so quickly.

**Speaker B:** No problem. I want to make it right. Thank you for telling me.

**Speaker A:** Of course. It's all part of learning. Is there anything else you need from me?

**Speaker B:** No, I think I am good. Just need to, um, focus on fixing it.

**Speaker A:** Alright, Xiao Li. I appreciate your effort. Let me know if you need anything.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will. Thank you for your understanding.

**Speaker A:** You're welcome. Have a great day, and good luck with the corrections!

**Speaker B:** Thank you! I will do my best. Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye, Xiao Li! Talk to you soon.
