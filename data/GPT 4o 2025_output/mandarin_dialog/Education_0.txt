**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey, Xiao Li! Are you ready for the exam next week?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Um, hello! I am... how to say... a little nervous. The exam is difficult, yes?

**Speaker A:** I understand. It can be challenging. Have you started studying yet?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I start study. I read the book and, um, do practice questions. But some part is hard for me.

**Speaker A:** Which parts are you finding difficult?

**Speaker B:** The, uh, essay part. I not sure how to write... um, good argument.

**Speaker A:** Essays can be tricky. Have you tried outlining your ideas first?

**Speaker B:** Outline? Ah, yes, I make list of points. But sometimes, I forget... how to connect them.

**Speaker A:** You can use transition words like "however" or "therefore" to connect your ideas.

**Speaker B:** Oh, yes! I remember now. Thank you. And, um, vocabulary is also problem.

**Speaker A:** Maybe try using flashcards to remember new words. It helps me a lot.

**Speaker B:** Flashcards, yes! I will try. Do you have other tips?

**Speaker A:** Sure! Study in short sessions and take breaks. It helps keep your mind fresh.

**Speaker B:** Ah, good idea. I will do that. And, um, can we study together sometime?

**Speaker A:** Of course! How about we meet this weekend to review?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that is good. What time is best for you?

**Speaker A:** How about Saturday at 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B:** Okay, Saturday 2 p.m. I will see you then.

**Speaker A:** Great! Don’t worry, we’ll do well. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B:** Thank you! See you Saturday!
