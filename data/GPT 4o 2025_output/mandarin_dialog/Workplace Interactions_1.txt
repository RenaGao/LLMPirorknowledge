**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, welcome to the team! I'm here to help you get started. Can you tell me a bit about your background?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, thank you! I am Xiao Li. I come from Beijing. I work in, um, software development for three years.

**Speaker A:** That's great, Xiao Li! Today, I'll explain how we manage our project tasks. Are you familiar with project management tools?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I use... how to say... tool for organize work. Like, um, Trello or Asana?

**Speaker A:** Perfect! We use a similar tool called Jira. It helps us track tasks and progress. Do you have any questions about it?

**Speaker B:** Um, yes. How to, uh, create new task in Jira?

**Speaker A:** Good question! To create a new task, you click on the "Create" button at the top. Then, fill in the details like the task name and description. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I understand. And, uh, assign task to person, how do?

**Speaker A:** You can assign a task by selecting a team member from the "Assignee" dropdown menu. It's quite straightforward. Would you like to try it now?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I try. Um, I click "Create," then write task name... and choose person. Right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly! You're doing well. If you need to add more details, you can use the "Description" box. Is there anything else you're curious about?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. How to, um, update task when finish?

**Speaker A:** Once a task is completed, you can change its status to "Done" by clicking on the status dropdown. It's important to keep the team updated. Do you think you can manage that?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I think I can. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A:** No problem at all! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. How are you feeling about using Jira now?

**Speaker B:** I feel better. Still need practice, but I will learn.

**Speaker A:** That's the spirit! Practice makes perfect. Let's catch up later this week to see how you're doing. Sound good?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that is good. Thank you again!

**Speaker A:** You're welcome, Xiao Li. Have a great day, and see you soon!

**Speaker B:** Thank you! See you soon!
