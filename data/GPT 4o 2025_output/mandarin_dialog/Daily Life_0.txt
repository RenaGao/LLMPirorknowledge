**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey, good morning! How was your morning today?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Good morning! Um, my morning is... how to say... busy, but good.

**Speaker A:** Busy, huh? What do you usually do in the morning?

**Speaker B:** I wake up at, uh, seven o'clock. First, I... um, brush teeth and wash face.

**Speaker A:** Sounds like a good start. Do you have breakfast after that?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I eat breakfast. I like, um, rice porridge. It is... uh, very common in China.

**Speaker A:** Oh, rice porridge sounds delicious! Do you make it yourself?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I make it. It is easy. Just rice and water, and... um, cook.

**Speaker A:** Nice! What do you do after breakfast?

**Speaker B:** After breakfast, I... um, how to say... prepare for work. I check email and, uh, plan my day.

**Speaker A:** That's a productive routine. Do you commute to work?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I take bus. It is about, um, 30 minutes. I listen to music on bus.

**Speaker A:** Listening to music is a great way to relax. What kind of music do you like?

**Speaker B:** I like pop music. Um, sometimes I listen to English songs to, uh, practice.

**Speaker A:** That's a smart way to improve your English! Do you have a favorite artist?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I like Taylor Swift. Her songs are, um, very nice.

**Speaker A:** Taylor Swift is great! So, after you get to work, whatâ€™s the first thing you do?

**Speaker B:** First, I... um, check my schedule. Then, I start work. It is, uh, busy but good.
