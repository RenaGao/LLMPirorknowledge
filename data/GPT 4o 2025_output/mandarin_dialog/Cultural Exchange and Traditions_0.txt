**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi! It's great to see you. I was wondering if you could tell me about a tradition or festival from your culture. I'm really curious!

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes, hello! Um, I can talk about... how to say... Spring Festival? It is very important in China.

**Speaker A:** Oh, the Spring Festival! That's also known as Chinese New Year, right?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes! Chinese New Year. It is big celebration. We have many, um, activities.

**Speaker A:** That sounds exciting! What kind of activities do you usually do?

**Speaker B:** We, uh, clean house before. It is for good luck. And we have... um, family dinner. Very big dinner.

**Speaker A:** Cleaning for good luck and a big family dinner, that sounds wonderful. What do you usually eat?

**Speaker B:** We eat dumplings, fish, and... um, rice cake. It is called "nian gao."

**Speaker A:** Yum, that sounds delicious! Is there anything else special about the festival?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we give red envelopes. Um, inside is money. It is for children, for good fortune.

**Speaker A:** Red envelopes, that's a lovely tradition. Do you have any special decorations?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we use red paper... um, how to say... with words? For happiness and luck.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you mean couplets? Those are beautiful. Do you also have fireworks?

**Speaker B:** Yes, fireworks! Very loud, but fun. It is to scare away... um, bad spirits.

**Speaker A:** I see, that makes sense. It must be a very lively time!

**Speaker B:** Yes, very lively! Many people visit family and friends. It is happy time.

**Speaker A:** It sounds like a wonderful celebration. Thank you for sharing this with me!

**Speaker B:** You are welcome! I am happy to talk about it.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad to learn more about your culture. Let's catch up again soon!

**Speaker B:** Yes, let's do that. Thank you, and goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Take care!
