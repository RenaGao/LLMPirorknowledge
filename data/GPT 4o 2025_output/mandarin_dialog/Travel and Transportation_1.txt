**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes, please. I am looking for, um, hotel. Nearby hotel.

**Speaker A:** Sure, I can help with that. Do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B:** Um, I think it is... how to say... "Green Tree Hotel"?

**Speaker A:** Oh, the Green Tree Hotel! Yes, I know where that is. It's not too far from here.

**Speaker B:** Thank you! How I can go there?

**Speaker A:** You can walk. It's about ten minutes. Go straight on this street, then turn left at the second traffic light.

**Speaker B:** Go straight, then left at... second light?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. After you turn left, you'll see the hotel on your right side.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay. I understand. Thank you very much!

**Speaker A:** No problem at all. Do you need any more help with directions?

**Speaker B:** Um, no, I think I am okay. Just... I hope not get lost.

**Speaker A:** You'll be fine. If you have any trouble, just ask someone nearby. People here are friendly.

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you. People very nice here.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else you need?

**Speaker B:** No, I think that is all. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A:** You're welcome! Have a great stay at the hotel.

**Speaker B:** Thank you! I will try. Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Take care and enjoy your time here!
