**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li! We’re planning a birthday surprise for Sarah. Can you help us with the preparations?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes! I can help. What, um, what do we need to do?

**Speaker A:** Great! We’re thinking of organizing a small party at her favorite café. Do you know it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I know. It is, um, the one near the park, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly! We need to decorate the place. Can you bring some balloons and streamers?

**Speaker B:** Balloons and... um, how to say... the long paper?

**Speaker A:** Streamers, yes. Can you bring those?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can bring. How many we need?

**Speaker A:** Maybe around 20 balloons and a few packs of streamers should be enough.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will buy them. And, um, what time we meet?

**Speaker A:** We’re meeting at 3 p.m. to set everything up. Is that okay for you?

**Speaker B:** Yes, 3 p.m. is good. Do we need, um, music or something?

**Speaker A:** Yes, we’ll have a playlist ready. Do you have any song suggestions?

**Speaker B:** Ah, maybe some, um, happy songs? Like, uh, pop music?

**Speaker A:** Perfect! I’ll add some pop songs to the list. Anything else you think we need?

**Speaker B:** Um, maybe cake? Do we have cake?

**Speaker A:** Yes, we’ve ordered her favorite chocolate cake. It’ll be delivered to the café.

**Speaker B:** Oh, good! I think we have everything then.

**Speaker A:** Awesome! Thanks for your help, Xiao Li. See you at 3 p.m. at the café.

**Speaker B:** Yes, see you then! Bye!

**Speaker A:** Bye! Looking forward to it!
