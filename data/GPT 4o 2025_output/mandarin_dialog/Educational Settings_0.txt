**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Hello, um, I have question about assignment. It is, uh, not clear for me.

**Speaker A:** Of course! Which part of the assignment are you having trouble with?

**Speaker B:** Uh, the part about, um, research... how to say... research method?

**Speaker A:** Ah, the research methods section. Are you unsure about which methods to use?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. I not sure which one to choose. There are many, um, options.

**Speaker A:** I understand. Have you thought about what kind of data you want to collect?

**Speaker B:** Um, I think... maybe survey? But I not know if it is good.

**Speaker A:** Surveys can be a great choice if you want to gather opinions or experiences. What is your topic?

**Speaker B:** My topic is, uh, student... um, how they manage time.

**Speaker A:** Time management among students? A survey could definitely work well for that.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. Thank you. And, um, how many questions should I ask?

**Speaker A:** It depends on how detailed you want your data to be. Maybe start with 10 to 15 questions?

**Speaker B:** Ah, I see. And, um, I need to, uh, write report after, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, you’ll need to write a report summarizing your findings. Do you need help with that part too?

**Speaker B:** Yes, please. I not sure how to start report.

**Speaker A:** You can start with an introduction about your topic and why it’s important. Then, describe your methods and findings.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will try. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A:** No problem at all! If you have more questions, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will. Thank you very much. Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Goodbye, and good luck with your assignment!
