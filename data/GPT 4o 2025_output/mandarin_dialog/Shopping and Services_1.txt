**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! Are you thinking about buying a new phone today?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Yes, um, I want to buy new phone. My old one is, uh, very slow now.

**Speaker A:** I understand. What features are you looking for in a new phone?

**Speaker B:** I think, um, good camera is important. I like take photo, uh, of nature and friends.

**Speaker A:** A good camera is definitely a great feature. Anything else you need?

**Speaker B:** Yes, also, um, battery life. My phone die very fast now. I need long battery.

**Speaker A:** Long battery life is crucial. Do you have a specific brand in mind?

**Speaker B:** Uh, I not sure. Maybe, um, Samsung or Apple? They are, uh, popular, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, both are popular and have good options. Do you prefer Android or iOS?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, I use Android before, but I hear iOS is, um, easy to use. What you think?

**Speaker A:** iOS is user-friendly, but it depends on what you're comfortable with. Do you use any specific apps?

**Speaker B:** I use, um, WeChat a lot. And also, uh, some game apps. They work on both, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, they work on both platforms. How about the price range? Do you have a budget?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes, budget is, um, important. I think maybe, uh, not too expensive. Mid-range is good.

**Speaker A:** Mid-range phones can be great value. Have you checked any reviews online?

**Speaker B:** I see some review, but, um, too many options. It is, uh, confusing.

**Speaker A:** I can help you narrow it down. Maybe we can look at some models together?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that is good idea. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A:** No problem! Let's find the perfect phone for you. Anything else you want to know?

**Speaker B:** Um, no, I think that is all. Thank you very much!

**Speaker A:** You're welcome, Xiao Li. Let me know if you need more help. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** Thank you! You too! Goodbye!
