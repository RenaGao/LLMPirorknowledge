**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li! How's your day going?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Hello! My day is good, thank you. Um, how about you?

**Speaker A:** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I was thinking, maybe we could plan an evening out. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. I think maybe we can go to eat. Um, do you know good restaurant?

**Speaker A:** Sure! There are a few nice places around. Do you prefer Italian or maybe something else?

**Speaker B:** Italian is good! I like pasta. But, um, I also like... how to say... spicy food?

**Speaker A:** Oh, spicy food! Maybe we could try a Mexican restaurant. They have some spicy dishes.

**Speaker B:** Yes, Mexican! I like that. And after dinner, what we do?

**Speaker A:** We could go to a movie or maybe a walk in the park. What do you think?

**Speaker B:** Movie is nice, but park is... um, more relax? 

**Speaker A:** Yes, a walk in the park is relaxing. We can enjoy the evening air.

**Speaker B:** Sounds good! What time we meet?

**Speaker A:** How about 6 p.m. at the restaurant?

**Speaker B:** Okay, 6 p.m. is good. Um, which restaurant we go?

**Speaker A:** Let's meet at "El Camino." It's a great Mexican place downtown.

**Speaker B:** El Camino, okay. I will find it. 

**Speaker A:** Great! If you have any trouble, just call me.

**Speaker B:** Thank you! I will. Um, see you tonight?

**Speaker A:** Yes, see you tonight! Looking forward to it.

**Speaker B:** Me too! Bye-bye!

**Speaker A:** Bye, Xiao Li!
