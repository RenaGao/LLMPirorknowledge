**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li! It's great to see you. Are you excited about planning our group vacation?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Yes, very excited! Um, I think we should go somewhere... how to say... relaxing?

**Speaker A:** That sounds perfect. Do you have any places in mind?

**Speaker B:** I think maybe beach is good. We can, uh, swim and... um, relax on sand.

**Speaker A:** A beach vacation sounds wonderful. Do you have a specific beach in mind?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, maybe Hawaii? I hear it is very beautiful and, uh, many activities.

**Speaker A:** Hawaii is a great choice! We can explore the islands, try surfing, and enjoy the local food.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes! I want to try... um, how to say... the food from there?

**Speaker A:** You mean Hawaiian cuisine? Like poke and loco moco?

**Speaker B:** Yes, Hawaiian food! I want to try. And maybe we can, uh, hike too?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, there are some amazing hiking trails in Hawaii. Do you think everyone in the group will like this plan?

**Speaker B:** I think so. Everyone like beach and, um, adventure. We can ask them.

**Speaker A:** Good idea. We should also decide on the dates. When are you free?

**Speaker B:** I am free in, uh, July. Is that okay for you?

**Speaker A:** July works for me too. Let's check with the others and finalize the dates.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will ask them. Um, what about hotel? Should we book soon?

**Speaker A:** Yes, booking early is smart. We can look for a place near the beach.

**Speaker B:** Sounds good. I will help with, uh, finding hotel. Maybe we can, um, share room?

**Speaker A:** Sharing a room is a great way to save money. Let's look into that.

**Speaker B:** Yes, save money is good. I am happy we plan this together.

**Speaker A:** Me too, Xiao Li. It's going to be an amazing trip. Let's talk again soon to finalize everything.

**Speaker B:** Yes, let's do that. Thank you for help. See you soon!

**Speaker A:** You're welcome! See you soon, Xiao Li!
