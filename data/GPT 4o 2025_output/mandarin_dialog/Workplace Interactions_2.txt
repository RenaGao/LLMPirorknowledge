**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Li! Thanks for joining the call today. Are you ready to plan our team meeting?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Yes, um, I am ready. We need to talk about, uh, what we do in meeting, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. We need to decide on the agenda. Do you have any ideas on what topics we should cover?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, I think we should talk about, uh, the new project. The one with, um, the... how to say... new software?

**Speaker A:** The software update project? That’s a good idea. Anything else?

**Speaker B:** Yes, maybe we also discuss, um, team roles. Who do what in project.

**Speaker A:** Great point. Clarifying roles is important. Should we also include a section for feedback?

**Speaker B:** Yes, feedback is good. We can, um, ask everyone to share their, uh, thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. So, we have the software update, team roles, and feedback. How long should each section be?

**Speaker B:** Maybe, uh, 20 minutes for software, 15 for roles, and, um, 10 for feedback?

**Speaker A:** That sounds reasonable. Do you think we need to add anything else?

**Speaker B:** Um, maybe we can have, uh, time for questions at end?

**Speaker A:** Yes, a Q&A session is a good idea. Let’s add 10 minutes for that. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that is good. I think it will be, um, helpful.

**Speaker A:** Alright, so our agenda is set. When should we have this meeting?

**Speaker B:** How about, um, next Tuesday? In the morning?

**Speaker A:** Tuesday morning works for me. How about 10 a.m.?

**Speaker B:** Yes, 10 a.m. is good. I will, um, send email to team.

**Speaker A:** Great, thank you, Li. I appreciate your help with this.

**Speaker B:** No problem! Thank you for, uh, your support.

**Speaker A:** Anytime. Looking forward to the meeting. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B:** Yes, see you soon! Goodbye!
