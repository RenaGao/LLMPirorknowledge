**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li! Thanks for meeting up. I heard you want to plan a surprise party for our friend, right?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Yes, yes! I want to make, um, surprise party for David. He have birthday soon.

**Speaker A:** That sounds fun! Do you have any ideas for the party?

**Speaker B:** Uh, I think maybe we can do at park? Like, um, picnic style.

**Speaker A:** A picnic sounds great! Do you know what kind of food we should bring?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, maybe some... sandwiches? And fruit, like apple and banana. Easy to eat.

**Speaker A:** Perfect! How about drinks? Should we bring some soda or juice?

**Speaker B:** Yes, juice is good. David like orange juice, I think.

**Speaker A:** Awesome. Do you need help with decorations?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. I not sure what to buy. Maybe you can help me choose?

**Speaker A:** Of course! We can get some balloons and a banner that says "Happy Birthday."

**Speaker B:** Good idea! And, um, maybe some... how to say... small lights?

**Speaker A:** Fairy lights? They would look nice in the park.

**Speaker B:** Yes, fairy lights! Thank you. And, um, what time should we start?

**Speaker A:** How about 3 p.m.? That way we have enough time to set up before David arrives.

**Speaker B:** Okay, 3 p.m. is good. I will tell others to come early.

**Speaker A:** Great! Do you need help with anything else?

**Speaker B:** No, I think this is all. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A:** No problem, happy to help! Letâ€™s make it a great party for David.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it will be fun! See you at the park.

**Speaker A:** See you there, Xiao Li! Have a good day!

**Speaker B:** You too! Bye-bye!
