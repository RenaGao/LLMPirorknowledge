**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes, please. I am looking for... um, how to say... big building, famous here?

**Speaker A:** Oh, you mean the town hall? It's quite a landmark around here.

**Speaker B:** Yes, town hall! I want to go there. Can you tell me how to go?

**Speaker A:** Sure! It's not too far from here. Do you know the main street?

**Speaker B:** Main street... um, I think I know. Is it the street with many shop?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's right. You just need to walk straight down that street.

**Speaker B:** Walk straight... and then?

**Speaker A:** After about two blocks, you'll see a big park on your right. The town hall is just past the park.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay. So, I walk two block, see park, then town hall is there?

**Speaker A:** Exactly! It's a big building with a clock tower, so you can't miss it.

**Speaker B:** Thank you! Um, how long it take to walk there?

**Speaker A:** It should take about 10 minutes if you walk at a normal pace.

**Speaker B:** Ten minute, okay. I think I can do that. Thank you very much!

**Speaker A:** You're welcome! Do you need any more help?

**Speaker B:** No, I think I am good. You help me a lot.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad to hear that. Enjoy your visit to the town hall!

**Speaker B:** Thank you! I will. Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Have a great day!
