**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li, I wanted to talk about our plan for the weekend. I think there was a bit of confusion.

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Oh, yes, um, I think maybe I not understand. Can you explain again?

**Speaker A:** Sure! I mentioned going to the park on Saturday, but I think you thought it was Sunday. Is that right?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes, I think you say Sunday. I sorry for mistake.

**Speaker A:** No worries at all! So, we’re planning for Saturday. Does that still work for you?

**Speaker B:** Yes, Saturday is good. Um, what time we meet again?

**Speaker A:** We said 10 a.m. at the park entrance. Is that okay?

**Speaker B:** Yes, 10 a.m. is okay. I will be there. We can rent bike, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly! There’s a place to rent bikes right at the entrance. Have you been there before?

**Speaker B:** I not go before, but I think it is easy to find, yes?

**Speaker A:** Yes, it’s very easy. Just look for the big sign that says “Bike Rentals.”

**Speaker B:** Okay, I understand now. Thank you for explain.

**Speaker A:** No problem! I’m glad we cleared that up. Anything else you want to do after biking?

**Speaker B:** Um, maybe we can have picnic? I bring some food.

**Speaker A:** That sounds perfect! I’ll bring some snacks too. Anything specific you like?

**Speaker B:** I like, um, fruit and maybe sandwich. Simple is good.

**Speaker A:** Great, I’ll bring some fruit and sandwiches. Looking forward to it!

**Speaker B:** Me too! Thank you for help with plan.

**Speaker A:** Anytime, Xiao Li. See you on Saturday at 10 a.m.!

**Speaker B:** Yes, see you Saturday! Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye!
