**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! I don't think we've met before. I'm Alex. What's your name?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Hello, Alex. I am Li Wei. Nice to meet you.

**Speaker A:** Nice to meet you too, Li Wei! Are you enjoying the party?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is very... um, lively. Many people here.

**Speaker A:** It sure is! So, what do you do, Li Wei?

**Speaker B:** I work in, uh, how to say... numbers? Ah, finance. I work in finance.

**Speaker A:** Oh, finance! That sounds interesting. Do you like it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I like it. It is, um, challenging but good. I learn many things.

**Speaker A:** That's great to hear. Are you from around here?

**Speaker B:** No, I am from Beijing. I come here for work, maybe two years ago.

**Speaker A:** Wow, Beijing! It must be quite different from here. Do you miss it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, sometimes. But I like here too. People are very friendly.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad to hear that. Have you had a chance to explore the city?

**Speaker B:** Yes, a little. I visit, um, big park and museum. Very nice.

**Speaker A:** Those are great places! Do you have any hobbies you enjoy?

**Speaker B:** I like to, um, read books and also cook. I try new recipes.

**Speaker A:** Cooking is fun! What's your favorite dish to make?

**Speaker B:** I like to make, uh, dumplings. They are, um, special from home.

**Speaker A:** Dumplings are delicious! I'd love to try them sometime.

**Speaker B:** Yes, maybe I can make for you one day.

**Speaker A:** That would be wonderful! Well, it was great meeting you, Li Wei.

**Speaker B:** Yes, nice to meet you too, Alex. Thank you for talking with me.

**Speaker A:** My pleasure! Enjoy the rest of the party.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, you too. Goodbye!
