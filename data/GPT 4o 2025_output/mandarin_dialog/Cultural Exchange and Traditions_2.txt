**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! Thanks for meeting with me today. I heard you’re interested in planning a cultural event. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Yes, thank you. I want to, um, share Chinese culture with others. Maybe, uh, have a festival?

**Speaker A:** That sounds wonderful! What kind of activities are you thinking about including?

**Speaker B:** Uh, we can have, um, how to say... traditional dance and music. Also, food... like dumplings and, uh, mooncakes.

**Speaker A:** Traditional dance and food are great ideas! Do you have a specific location in mind for the event?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, maybe in the park? It is, uh, big and have space for many people.

**Speaker A:** A park is a good choice. How about the timing? When do you plan to hold this event?

**Speaker B:** I think, um, during the spring. Weather is nice, and people like to go outside.

**Speaker A:** Spring sounds perfect. Do you need any help with organizing or promoting the event?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I need help with, um, telling people. Maybe, uh, social media? I not very good at it.

**Speaker A:** I can definitely help with that. We can create a page and share it widely. Do you have any volunteers to assist during the event?

**Speaker B:** I ask some friends. They say, um, they can help with setting up and, uh, cleaning after.

**Speaker A:** That’s great! Having friends to help makes a big difference. Is there anything else you need to prepare?

**Speaker B:** Um, maybe, uh, decorations? Like, uh, lanterns and banners. Make it look, uh, festive.

**Speaker A:** Decorations will definitely add to the atmosphere. I can help you find some local stores or online options for those.

**Speaker B:** Thank you! That is very helpful. I want people to, um, feel happy and learn about our culture.

**Speaker A:** I’m sure they will. It sounds like a fantastic event. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss?

**Speaker B:** No, I think that is all. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! I’m excited to see how it turns out. Let’s keep in touch and finalize the details soon.

**Speaker B:** Yes, let’s do that. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Talk to you soon!
