**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey, it's great to see you! I heard you recently visited a new city. How was it?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes, I went to, um, San Francisco. It was very... how to say... interesting!

**Speaker A:** That's awesome! What did you find interesting about it?

**Speaker B:** The city have, um, many hills. And the bridge, uh, Golden Gate, is very big and red.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the Golden Gate Bridge is quite famous. Did you get to walk across it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I walk... um, across. It was windy, but view is very nice.

**Speaker A:** Sounds like a great experience! Did you try any local food while you were there?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I try... um, seafood. The crab is very fresh. I like it much.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I love seafood too! Did you visit any other places in the city?

**Speaker B:** I go to, um, Alcatraz Island. It is... how to say... old prison?

**Speaker A:** Yes, Alcatraz is an old prison. What did you think of it?

**Speaker B:** It was... um, a little scary, but very... interesting history.

**Speaker A:** I can imagine! Did you take any tours or just explore on your own?

**Speaker B:** I take tour. The guide was very... um, helpful and tell many stories.

**Speaker A:** That's great! It sounds like you had a full trip. How long were you there?

**Speaker B:** I stay for, um, three days. It was short, but I see many things.

**Speaker A:** Three days is a good amount of time to explore. Would you like to go back someday?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I want to go back. Maybe see more, um, museums next time.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a plan! I'm glad you enjoyed your trip.

**Speaker B:** Thank you! It was very fun. I hope to travel more.

**Speaker A:** I'm sure you will. Thanks for sharing your experience with me!

**Speaker B:** Thank you for listening. Um, see you next time!

**Speaker A:** Definitely! Take care and see you soon!
