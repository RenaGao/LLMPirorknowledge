**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A:** I'm doing well, thanks! So, do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B:** Um, yes, I think... I want to plan picnic with my family.

**Speaker A:** That sounds lovely! Do you have a place in mind for the picnic?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we think to go to, um, how to say... big park near my house.

**Speaker A:** Oh, a nearby park. That’s convenient! What do you plan to bring for the picnic?

**Speaker B:** We will bring food, like sandwiches and fruit. Maybe some... um, drink, like juice.

**Speaker A:** Sounds delicious! Are you planning any activities at the park?

**Speaker B:** Yes, maybe we play games. My children like... um, flying kite.

**Speaker A:** Flying kites is a great idea! Do you have everything you need for the picnic?

**Speaker B:** I think so. We have blanket, and... um, basket for food. But I need to buy kite.

**Speaker A:** That’s good planning. Do you need any help with organizing the picnic?

**Speaker B:** No, thank you. I think I can manage. But, um, what time is good to go?

**Speaker A:** I’d suggest going in the morning, maybe around 10 a.m., when it’s not too hot.

**Speaker B:** Yes, morning is good. Thank you for advice!

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! I hope you have a wonderful time with your family.

**Speaker B:** Thank you! I hope so too. It will be fun.

**Speaker A:** I’m sure it will be. Let me know how it goes!

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will tell you. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A:** No problem at all. Have a great weekend!

**Speaker B:** You too! Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Take care!
