**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi! So, I heard you like cooking. Can you tell me how you prepare your favorite meal?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes! I like to cook... um, how to say... dumplings. 

**Speaker A:** Dumplings? That sounds delicious! How do you make them?

**Speaker B:** First, I make dough. It is... um, flour and water. Mix together.

**Speaker A:** Got it. You mix flour and water to make the dough. What’s next?

**Speaker B:** Then, I make filling. I use pork, cabbage, and... um, ginger. Chop very small.

**Speaker A:** Sounds tasty! Do you add any seasoning to the filling?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I add soy sauce, salt, and... um, sesame oil. Mix all together.

**Speaker A:** Nice! So, you mix the filling ingredients. How do you put it all together?

**Speaker B:** I take dough, make small circle. Put filling inside, then... um, fold and pinch.

**Speaker A:** You fold and pinch the edges to seal the dumplings, right?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes! Seal dumplings. Then, I boil in water until... um, they float.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you boil them until they float. Do you serve them with anything?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I make sauce. Soy sauce, vinegar, and... um, garlic. Mix together.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a perfect dipping sauce! Do you eat them right away?

**Speaker B:** Yes, eat when hot. Very good! 

**Speaker A:** I bet they are! Thanks for sharing your recipe. I’d love to try them sometime.

**Speaker B:** You are welcome! I can make for you one day.

**Speaker A:** That would be amazing! Let’s plan for it soon.

**Speaker B:** Yes, we plan. Thank you for listening.

**Speaker A:** My pleasure! Have a great day, and see you later!

**Speaker B:** Okay, see you later!
