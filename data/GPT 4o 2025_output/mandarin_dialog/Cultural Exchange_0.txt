**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi! Thanks for meeting with me today. I’d love to hear about a tradition or festival from your country. Could you share one with me?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Yes, of course. Um, in China, we have Mid-Autumn Festival. It is very important, like, um, family time.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that sounds interesting! What do people usually do during the Mid-Autumn Festival?

**Speaker B:** We, uh, we eat mooncakes. They are, um, round cakes with, uh, sweet filling. And we look at the moon.

**Speaker A:** Mooncakes sound delicious! Is there a special meaning behind the moon?

**Speaker B:** Yes, the moon is, um, symbol of reunion. Family come together, and we, uh, enjoy the full moon.

**Speaker A:** That’s beautiful. Do you have any other activities during the festival?

**Speaker B:** Yes, sometimes we, um, have lanterns. Children like to, uh, carry lanterns and, um, play outside.

**Speaker A:** Lanterns must look lovely at night. Is there a story or legend associated with the festival?

**Speaker B:** Yes, there is a story about, um, Chang’e. She is, uh, moon goddess. She, um, live on the moon.

**Speaker A:** A moon goddess? That’s fascinating! Do people tell this story during the festival?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we tell the story, and, um, sometimes we have, uh, performances. Like, uh, dance or play.

**Speaker A:** It sounds like a wonderful celebration. How do you usually celebrate with your family?

**Speaker B:** We, um, have dinner together. And, uh, we give mooncakes to friends and family. It is, um, sharing happiness.

**Speaker A:** Sharing happiness sounds like a lovely tradition. Thank you for explaining the Mid-Autumn Festival to me.

**Speaker B:** You’re welcome! I am happy to share. Um, thank you for listening.

**Speaker A:** It was my pleasure. I learned a lot today. Let’s talk again soon!

**Speaker B:** Yes, I would like that. Goodbye!
