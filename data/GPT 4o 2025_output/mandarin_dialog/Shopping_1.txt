**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! Are you looking to buy something special today?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Hello! Yes, I want to buy, um, how to say... a scarf. For my friend.

**Speaker A:** A scarf, great choice! Do you have a specific color or style in mind?

**Speaker B:** Ah, maybe red color. It is, um, lucky color in China.

**Speaker A:** Red is a beautiful choice. Let me show you some options. Here, this one is very popular.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it is nice. How much is this one?

**Speaker A:** This scarf is $25. It's made of high-quality wool.

**Speaker B:** Hmm, $25... a bit expensive. Can it be, um, cheaper?

**Speaker A:** I understand. How about $20? It's a fair price for the quality.

**Speaker B:** Um, maybe $18? I think it is, uh, good price.

**Speaker A:** I see you're a good negotiator! Alright, let's meet in the middle at $19. How does that sound?

**Speaker B:** Okay, $19 is good. Thank you for, um, helping.

**Speaker A:** You're welcome! Is there anything else you need today?

**Speaker B:** No, just the scarf. I think it will be, um, perfect gift.

**Speaker A:** I'm sure your friend will love it. Would you like it gift-wrapped?

**Speaker B:** Yes, please. That would be, um, very nice.

**Speaker A:** Great, I'll wrap it up for you. Here you go!

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much. You are very, um, kind.

**Speaker A:** My pleasure! Have a wonderful day and enjoy your shopping.
