**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! Can I help you find something today?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes, please. I am looking for, um, how to say... a thing for cooking rice.

**Speaker A:** A rice cooker?

**Speaker B:** Yes, rice cooker! I need one for my new apartment.

**Speaker A:** Great! We have a few options. Do you have a specific brand in mind?

**Speaker B:** Um, not sure. Maybe something not too expensive, but good quality.

**Speaker A:** I understand. We have this one here, it's affordable and reliable. Would you like to see it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, please. Can I, um, see how it work?

**Speaker A:** Of course! Let me show you. It’s very easy to use. You just add rice and water, then press this button.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I see. It is simple. How much is this one?

**Speaker A:** This model is $50. It’s a popular choice among customers.

**Speaker B:** Hmm, $50... okay, I think it is good. I will take it.

**Speaker A:** Excellent choice! Would you like any other kitchen appliances?

**Speaker B:** Um, no, just this one today. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! If you need anything else, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** No problem at all. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** Thank you, you too! Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Enjoy your new rice cooker!
