**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! Thanks for joining me today. Can you tell me about your favorite hobby?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes, thank you. My favorite hobby is, um, how to say... drawing picture.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you mean drawing or painting?

**Speaker B:** Yes, drawing and painting. I like to use color, um, color pencil and sometimes paint.

**Speaker A:** That sounds wonderful! What do you enjoy most about drawing?

**Speaker B:** I enjoy... how to say... making picture from my mind. It is very, um, relaxing for me.

**Speaker A:** I see. Do you have a favorite subject you like to draw?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I like to draw nature. Like tree, mountain, and, um, river. It is very beautiful.

**Speaker A:** Nature is a great inspiration. How often do you draw?

**Speaker B:** I try to draw, um, every weekend. When I have free time, I draw more.

**Speaker A:** That's a good routine. Have you ever taken any art classes?

**Speaker B:** No, I not take class. I learn by myself. Watch video and, um, read book.

**Speaker A:** Self-taught! That's impressive. Do you share your artwork with others?

**Speaker B:** Sometimes, I show to friend. They say it is, um, nice. But I am shy to show many people.

**Speaker A:** I understand. It's great that your friends appreciate your work. Do you have any goals with your drawing?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I want to, um, improve and maybe one day, how to say... have exhibition?

**Speaker A:** An exhibition sounds like a fantastic goal! I'm sure you'll get there with practice.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. I hope so. Drawing makes me very happy.

**Speaker A:** That's the most important part. Well, it was great talking to you about your hobby.

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you for listening. I enjoy talking with you.

**Speaker A:** You're welcome! Let's chat again soon. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** Yes, you too! Goodbye!
