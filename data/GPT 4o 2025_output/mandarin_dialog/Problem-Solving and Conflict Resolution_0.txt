**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li, I heard you were upset about something I said last week. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Oh, yes, um, I think maybe I not understand. You say... how to say... you not like my idea?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I see. I didn’t mean it that way. I actually thought your idea was interesting. Maybe I didn’t express it well.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay. I think you say it not good. I feel... um, not happy.

**Speaker A:** I’m really sorry if it came across that way. I value your ideas a lot. Can you tell me more about what you were thinking?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I want to, um, make a plan for our project. I think we can, uh, work together more.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a great plan. I’d love to hear more about your ideas. Maybe we can brainstorm together?

**Speaker B:** Yes, brainstorm! I like that. We can, um, find new way to do things.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. I think working together will help us come up with the best solutions. Do you have any specific ideas in mind?

**Speaker B:** I think we can, um, use new software. It help us, uh, organize better.

**Speaker A:** That’s a good suggestion. Do you have a particular software in mind?

**Speaker B:** Um, I see one called Trello. It is, uh, for team work and project.

**Speaker A:** Trello is a great tool for organizing projects. I’ve used it before. Would you like me to show you how it works?

**Speaker B:** Yes, please. I want to learn. It will be, um, very helpful.

**Speaker A:** Sure, I can show you. Let’s set up a time to go through it together. How about tomorrow afternoon?

**Speaker B:** Tomorrow afternoon is good. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A:** No problem at all. I’m glad we talked about this. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss?

**Speaker B:** No, I think we, um, understand now. Thank you for, uh, listening.

**Speaker A:** Of course, Xiao Li. I’m glad we cleared things up. Let’s keep communicating openly.

**Speaker B:** Yes, open talk is good. Thank you again. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker A:** See you tomorrow, Xiao Li! Have a great day!
