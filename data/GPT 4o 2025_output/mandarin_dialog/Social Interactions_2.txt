**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):**  
Hi there! It's been a while since we last talked. How have you been?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):**  
Hello! Yes, long time no see. I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A:**  
I'm doing well, thanks for asking. So, what have you been up to lately?

**Speaker B:**  
Um, I have been busy with work. I, uh, work in a company for, um, technology. How about you?

**Speaker A:**  
That sounds interesting! I've been busy with work too, but I try to find time for hobbies. Do you have any hobbies?

**Speaker B:**  
Yes, I like, um, how to say... painting? I paint in free time.

**Speaker A:**  
Painting, that's wonderful! What kind of things do you like to paint?

**Speaker B:**  
I like to paint nature, like trees and, um, mountains. It is very... relaxing.

**Speaker A:**  
That sounds beautiful. I'd love to see your paintings someday. Do you have any plans to visit here soon?

**Speaker B:**  
Ah, I want to visit, but maybe next year. It is, um, difficult now because of work.

**Speaker A:**  
I understand. Work can be demanding. But it would be great to catch up in person when you can.

**Speaker B:**  
Yes, I agree. I miss family and, um, the food there!

**Speaker A:**  
We miss you too! And there's always plenty of food waiting for you here.

**Speaker B:**  
Haha, thank you! I look forward to it. Um, how is everyone there?

**Speaker A:**  
Everyone is doing well. The kids are growing up fast. They always ask about you.

**Speaker B:**  
Oh, that is nice to hear. I will, um, send them a gift soon.

**Speaker A:**  
They'll love that! It's so thoughtful of you. Is there anything you need from here?

**Speaker B:**  
No, I am okay. But thank you for asking. I appreciate it.

**Speaker A:**  
Of course! It's always nice to talk to you. Let's not wait too long for our next chat.

**Speaker B:**  
Yes, I agree. It is good to talk. Um, take care and say hello to everyone for me.

**Speaker A:**  
Will do! Take care of yourself too. Goodbye for now!

**Speaker B:**  
Goodbye! Talk soon!
