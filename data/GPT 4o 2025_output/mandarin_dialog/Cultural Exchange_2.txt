**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! I was curious, could you tell me about your favorite holiday in your country?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Oh, yes, um... my favorite holiday is, uh, Spring Festival. It is very important in China.

**Speaker A:** Spring Festival sounds interesting! What do you usually do during this holiday?

**Speaker B:** We, um, we have big family dinner. And, uh, we give red... red envelope, you know?

**Speaker A:** Ah, red envelopes! Those are for good luck, right?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes! For good luck. We also, um, watch fireworks. Very beautiful.

**Speaker A:** That sounds amazing! Is there a special food you eat during the Spring Festival?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we eat dumplings. Uh, how to say... they mean, um, wealth? Like money.

**Speaker A:** Dumplings symbolize wealth, I see. Do you have any favorite memories from the Spring Festival?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, yes. I remember, um, when I was child, we play with, uh, firecrackers. Very fun!

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a lot of fun! Do you celebrate with your family every year?

**Speaker B:** Yes, every year. Family is very important, um, during this time.

**Speaker A:** I can see that. It must be nice to have everyone together.

**Speaker B:** Yes, very nice. We also, um, clean house before festival. It is, uh, for good luck too.

**Speaker A:** Cleaning for good luck, that's interesting! Do you have any other traditions?

**Speaker B:** We, um, we also watch, uh, Spring Festival Gala on TV. It is very popular.

**Speaker A:** I've heard about that! It sounds like a big event. Thank you for sharing all this with me.

**Speaker B:** You are welcome! I am happy to talk about it.

**Speaker A:** I learned a lot today. Thanks again! Let's chat more about this another time.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sure! Thank you for listening. Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Have a great day!
