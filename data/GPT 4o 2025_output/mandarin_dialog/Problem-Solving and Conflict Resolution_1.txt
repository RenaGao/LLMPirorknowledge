**Speaker A:** I see. Have you tried restarting your router?

**Speaker B:** Um, not yet. I not sure how to, uh, explain problem to them.

**Speaker A:** No worries. You can tell them your internet is slow and you've already restarted the router and checked the cables.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will try. And, um, if they ask more, what I say?

**Speaker A:** You can mention any error messages you see or if the issue happens at specific times.
