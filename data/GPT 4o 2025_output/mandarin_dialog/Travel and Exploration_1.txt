**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! Thanks for joining me today. Can you tell me about your favorite place to visit and why it’s special to you?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes, thank you. My favorite place is, um, how to say... the park near my home.

**Speaker A:** Oh, a park! What do you like about it?

**Speaker B:** I like it because it is very... um, peaceful. Many trees and flowers. It is good for relax.

**Speaker A:** That sounds lovely. Do you go there often?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I go... um, maybe every weekend. I like to walk and sometimes, uh, read book there.

**Speaker A:** That’s a nice way to spend the weekend. Do you go alone or with friends?

**Speaker B:** Sometimes with friends. We, um, have picnic or ride bicycle. It is fun.

**Speaker A:** Picnics and bike rides sound like a lot of fun! Is there anything else you do at the park?

**Speaker B:** Yes, sometimes I, um, take photo. The park is very beautiful, especially in spring.

**Speaker A:** I bet the photos are amazing! Do you have a favorite spot in the park?

**Speaker B:** Yes, there is a small lake. I like to sit there and, um, watch the ducks.

**Speaker A:** Watching ducks sounds relaxing. Why is this park special to you?

**Speaker B:** It is special because, um, I go there since I was child. Many good memory.

**Speaker A:** That’s wonderful. It must feel like a second home to you.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is like home. I feel very happy there.

**Speaker A:** I’m glad you have such a special place. Thank you for sharing!

**Speaker B:** Thank you for listening. It was nice to talk about it.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely! It was great hearing about your favorite place. Have a wonderful day!

**Speaker B:** Thank you, you too! Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Take care!
