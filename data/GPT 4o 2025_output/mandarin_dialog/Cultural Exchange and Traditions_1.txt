**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! It's great to chat with you today. I was wondering, have you noticed any differences in dining etiquette between our cultures?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes, hello! I think, um, there are some differences. In China, we use chopsticks, and maybe in your country, you use fork and knife more?

**Speaker A:** That's right! We usually use forks and knives. How about in China, are there any special rules with chopsticks?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. We not put chopsticks, um, standing in rice. It is, uh, bad luck. Like, um, funeral thing.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I see. That's interesting. In Western culture, we don't have that rule. Are there any other customs during meals?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, let me think... Oh, yes! We often share dishes. Everyone take from big plate. Is it same for you?

**Speaker A:** Not exactly. We usually have individual plates, but sharing is common in some settings, like family-style dining. Do you have any other dining habits?

**Speaker B:** Um, yes. We say "thank you" to the person who cook. It is polite. Do you do same?

**Speaker A:** Yes, we also thank the cook. It's a nice way to show appreciation. How about tipping? Is that common in China?

**Speaker B:** Tipping, um, not very common. Maybe in big city, but usually not. How about in your place?

**Speaker A:** Tipping is quite common here, especially in restaurants. It's a way to show gratitude for good service. Do you find it confusing?

**Speaker B:** A little, yes. I sometimes not sure how much to give. Is there a rule?

**Speaker A:** Generally, around 15-20% of the bill is standard. But it can vary. Do you have any questions about dining here?

**Speaker B:** Um, yes. I hear about, uh, "doggy bag"? What is that?

**Speaker A:** A "doggy bag" is when you take leftover food home from a restaurant. It's quite common here. Do you do that in China?

**Speaker B:** Sometimes, yes. But maybe not as much. We try to finish food. It is, um, polite to finish.

**Speaker A:** That's a good habit! It's been great learning about these differences. Anything else you'd like to share?

**Speaker B:** No, I think that is all. Thank you for, um, sharing with me.

**Speaker A:** You're welcome! It was a pleasure talking with you. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
