**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey, Xiao Li! I was thinking about how different dining etiquette can be around the world. Have you noticed any interesting differences between here and China?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Ah, yes, I notice many things. In China, we use chopsticks, but here, um, more fork and knife, right?

**Speaker A:** That's true! Forks and knives are more common here. Do you find it difficult to use them?

**Speaker B:** At first, yes, a little difficult. But now, I am... how to say... more used to it.

**Speaker A:** That's great! What about other differences, like table manners?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, in China, we often share food. Like, many dishes in middle of table. Here, more... um, individual plate?

**Speaker A:** Yes, we usually have our own plates. Sharing sounds nice, though. It feels more communal.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is very... um, friendly. Also, in China, we sometimes make noise when eat soup. It show enjoy. Here, maybe not polite?

**Speaker A:** Right, slurping is usually considered impolite here. But I think it's interesting how it shows enjoyment in China.

**Speaker B:** Yes, different culture, different way. Also, in China, we say "ganbei" for cheers, and drink all. Here, just sip, yes?

**Speaker A:** Exactly, "ganbei" means to drink it all, but here we usually just take a sip. It's fascinating how these customs vary.

**Speaker B:** Yes, very interesting. I learn a lot about culture from food.

**Speaker A:** Me too! It's a great way to understand each other better. Do you have a favorite dish from home you miss?

**Speaker B:** Oh, I miss hot pot. It is... um, very warm and social. Everyone cook together.

**Speaker A:** Hot pot sounds delicious! We should try it together sometime.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that would be fun! I can show you how to make it.

**Speaker A:** I'd love that. Thanks for sharing all these insights, Xiao Li. It's always great to learn from you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you too! I enjoy talk about this. We learn from each other.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. Let's catch up again soon. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** Yes, see you soon! Have a good day too!
