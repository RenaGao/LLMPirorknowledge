**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li! Are you excited about planning our trip to the new city?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, L2):** Yes, very excited! Um, I think it will be fun. We can see many... how to say... interesting places?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely! Do you have any specific places in mind that you want to visit?

**Speaker B:** I hear about big museum there. It have, um, many old things. History things.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you mean the historical museum? That sounds like a great idea. Do you know how we can get there?

**Speaker B:** Uh, not sure. Maybe we take bus or... um, train? I can check map.

**Speaker A:** Good plan. We should also think about where to stay. Do you have any preferences?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, maybe hotel near city center? It is easy for, uh, walking to places.

**Speaker A:** Yes, staying in the city center would be convenient. How about food? Any particular cuisine you want to try?

**Speaker B:** I want to try local food. I hear it is very... um, delicious? Maybe we can ask local people for best place.

**Speaker A:** That's a great idea. Locals always know the best spots. How many days do you think we should stay?

**Speaker B:** Maybe three days? Enough time to see and, um, relax.

**Speaker A:** Three days sounds perfect. Should we make a list of things to pack?

**Speaker B:** Yes, good idea. I think we need, um, camera, clothes, and... how to say... charger for phone?

**Speaker A:** Right, a phone charger is essential. Anything else you can think of?

**Speaker B:** Maybe some snacks for travel. And, uh, map or guidebook?

**Speaker A:** Snacks and a guidebook are smart choices. Do you want to meet up to finalize our plans?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we can meet. Um, maybe this weekend?

**Speaker A:** Sure, let's meet on Saturday afternoon. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B:** Yes, Saturday is good. We can talk more and, um, decide everything.

**Speaker A:** Perfect! I'm looking forward to it. Thanks for planning with me, Xiao Li.

**Speaker B:** Thank you too! I am happy to plan with you. See you Saturday!

**Speaker A:** See you then! Have a great day!
