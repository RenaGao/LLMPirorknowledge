**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! We need to plan a birthday surprise for our friend, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, um, I think it is good idea. How we start?

**Speaker A (NS):** First, we should decide on a location. Do you have any suggestions?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, maybe... park? It is nice outside now.

**Speaker A (NS):** A park sounds great! We can have a picnic. What about food?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, food is important. Um, maybe sandwiches and... how to say... small cakes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, cupcakes! Those are perfect. Do you know if our friend likes any specific flavors?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** She like chocolate, I think. And maybe fruit, like strawberry.

**Speaker A (NS):** Chocolate and strawberry cupcakes it is! How about decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Decorations... um, balloons? And maybe, uh, banner with "Happy Birthday"?

**Speaker A (NS):** Balloons and a banner sound festive! Do you think we should have any games or activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, games are fun. Maybe, um, how to say... treasure hunt?

**Speaker A (NS):** A treasure hunt is a fantastic idea! We can hide small gifts around the park.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, small gifts. It will be surprise and fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We should also think about a gift. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Gift... maybe something she can use every day? Like, um, nice cup or... how to say... diary?

**Speaker A (NS):** A mug or a journal could be nice. Let's decide on that later. When should we meet to set everything up?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, maybe one hour before? So we have time to prepare.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Let's meet at the park an hour early. Anything else we need to plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think we have everything. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm excited for the surprise. See you at the park!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you there! Bye!
