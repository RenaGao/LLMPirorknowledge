**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! Do you have a moment to discuss the project deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, hello. I have time now. We talk about deadline, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! The deadline is approaching. How is the project going?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, project is... how to say... progressing? But, some part is slow.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Which part is taking longer than expected?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** The, uh, design part. We have... um, many changes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Design changes can be tricky. Do you need more resources or help?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe, yes. More help is good. I think we need... um, more designer?

**Speaker A (NS):** I can arrange for an additional designer to assist. Will that help speed things up?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that will help. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Is there anything else you’re concerned about?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, testing phase. I worry it take long time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Testing is important. We can schedule extra time for it. Does that sound okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is good idea. Extra time is helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s aim to finish the design by next week. Is that possible?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think, yes. We try hard to finish.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent. Let’s meet again next week to review progress. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is good. We meet next week.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Thank you for your hard work, Yuki. Let’s keep in touch.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you, too. I will do my best. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Yuki! Talk to you soon.
