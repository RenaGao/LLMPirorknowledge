**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for coming in today. Can you tell me a bit about your current exercise routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Thank you. I do running... um, three times a week. And sometimes, I do yoga.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good! How long do you usually run for?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I run... maybe, uh, 30 minutes. But sometimes, I feel tired, so shorter.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's understandable. Do you have any specific fitness goals you're working towards?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to be... um, more strong. And also, lose some weight.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great goals! Have you thought about adding strength training to your routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Strength training... um, like lifting weights?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! It can help build muscle and boost your metabolism.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. I never try before. Is it difficult?

**Speaker A (NS):** It can be challenging at first, but we can start with light weights and simple exercises.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I want to try. How many times should I do in a week?

**Speaker A (NS):** Starting with two to three times a week is a good idea. We can adjust as you progress.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I understand. And, um, what about food? Should I change?

**Speaker A (NS):** Eating a balanced diet with plenty of protein can support your goals. We can discuss a plan if you'd like.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, please. I want to eat better. Sometimes, I eat too much... um, snack.

**Speaker A (NS):** We can work on that together. It's all about finding a balance that works for you.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I feel more... um, motivated now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to hear that! Let's set up a schedule and get started.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, let's do it. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Looking forward to working with you. See you next time!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you next time! Thank you again.
