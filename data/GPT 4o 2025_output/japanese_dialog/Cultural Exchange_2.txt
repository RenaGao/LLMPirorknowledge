**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! I was curious, what is your favorite holiday in Japan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! My favorite holiday is... um, New Year. In Japan, we say "Oshogatsu."

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, New Year! What do you usually do during Oshogatsu?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We, um, visit shrine. It is called... how to say... "Hatsumode."

**Speaker A (NS):** Hatsumode, that sounds interesting! Do you go with your family?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, with family. We pray for... um, good health and happiness.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s lovely. Do you have any special foods for New Year?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we eat "Osechi." It is... many small dishes in box.

**Speaker A (NS):** Osechi sounds delicious! What’s your favorite dish in Osechi?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like... um, "Kurikinton." It is sweet potato and chestnut.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sweet potato and chestnut, that sounds tasty! Do you make it yourself?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, my mother make it. I help sometimes, but not good.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you’re better than you think! Do you have any other traditions?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we watch... um, "Kohaku Uta Gassen." It is music show on TV.
