**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to hear that! So, what do you do, Yuki?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I work in... how to say... company for technology. We make software.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you work in a tech company? That's interesting! What kind of software do you make?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We make, uh, software for business. Like, um, help with money and... um, data.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, business software. That sounds important. Do you enjoy your work?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I like it. It is... um, challenging but good. I learn many things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nature photography sounds beautiful. Do you have any favorite places to take photos?
