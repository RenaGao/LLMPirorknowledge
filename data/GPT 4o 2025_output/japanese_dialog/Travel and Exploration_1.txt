**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can you tell me about your favorite place to visit and why it’s special to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. My favorite place is Kyoto. It is very... um, how to say... beautiful and old?

**Speaker A (NS):** Beautiful and historic, maybe?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, historic! Many temples and gardens. I like very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful. What do you enjoy doing there?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like to walk in... um, Arashiyama. The bamboo forest is very... calming?

**Speaker A (NS):** Calming, yes. It must be peaceful there. Do you have a favorite temple?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, Kinkaku-ji. It is... um, gold temple. Very shiny and... um, beautiful in water.

**Speaker A (NS):** The Golden Pavilion, right? It’s quite famous. Have you tried any local food there?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I try... um, yudofu. It is tofu in hot water. Simple but... um, delicious.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yudofu sounds tasty! Do you visit Kyoto often?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not often, but I want to go more. Maybe... um, once a year?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice. It’s good to have a special place to visit. Do you have any plans to go soon?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, maybe next spring. I want to see cherry blossoms.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that would be beautiful! Spring is a great time to visit.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I think so. I hope to take many photos.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you’ll capture some amazing shots. Thank you for sharing about Kyoto.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you for listening. I enjoy talking about Kyoto.

**Speaker A (NS):** It was my pleasure. I hope you have a wonderful trip next time you go.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you. I will try. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care and see you next time!
