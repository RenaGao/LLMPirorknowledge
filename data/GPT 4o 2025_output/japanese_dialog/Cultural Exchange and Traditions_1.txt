**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I was wondering if you could tell me about dining etiquette in Japan. I’ve heard it’s quite different from here.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, hello! In Japan, we have, um, many rules for eating. Like, we say "Itadakimasu" before start eating.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s interesting! It’s like saying grace before a meal. What does "Itadakimasu" mean?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It is... um, how to say... like "I receive this food." It is polite to say.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. And what about using chopsticks? Are there specific rules?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, chopsticks have many rules. We do not, um, stick them in rice. It is bad... um, bad meaning.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, I’ve heard that’s considered disrespectful. Anything else to keep in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we do not pass food with chopsticks. It is, um, like funeral custom.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to know. How about slurping noodles? Is that okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! Slurping is okay. It show you enjoy the food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s quite different from here. We usually try to eat quietly. What about tipping?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** In Japan, no tipping. It is not... um, not common. Service is part of price.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s convenient. It must make dining out simpler. Do you find dining etiquette here in the U.S. different?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, very different. Here, um, people talk more during meal. In Japan, we are more quiet.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true. We do enjoy conversation at the table. Is there anything else you find interesting?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think, um, portion size is big here. In Japan, smaller, more... um, balanced.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, portions can be quite large here. Thank you for sharing all this. It’s fascinating to learn about these differences.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome. I enjoy talking about it. Thank you for listening.

**Speaker A (NS):** My pleasure! It was great to learn from you. Let’s chat again sometime.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, let’s do that. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day!
