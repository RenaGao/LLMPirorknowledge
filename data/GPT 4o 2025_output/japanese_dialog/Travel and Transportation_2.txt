**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Have you thought about where you'd like to go for our group vacation?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, hello! Yes, I think maybe... Kyoto? It is very, uh, how to say... traditional place.

**Speaker A (NS):** Kyoto sounds wonderful! There are so many historical sites to see. What activities do you have in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I want to see... um, temples and maybe... try tea ceremony? It is very... cultural.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great plan. The tea ceremony is a unique experience. How about food? Any specific dishes you want to try?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to eat... um, Kyoto cuisine. It is... how to say... special taste?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, Kyoto cuisine is quite special. Have you thought about how we'll get there?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, I think... maybe shinkansen? It is fast, but... um, maybe expensive?

**Speaker A (NS):** The bullet train is fast, but if it's too pricey, we could consider taking a bus. It's more affordable.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, bus is good idea. We can see... um, scenery on the way.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, and it gives us more time to chat and plan our activities. When do you think we should leave?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe... early morning? So we have... um, more time in Kyoto.

**Speaker A (NS):** Early morning sounds perfect. We can meet at the station around 7 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, 7 a.m. is good. I will bring... um, snacks for trip.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, snacks are always a good idea. Is there anything else we need to plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, maybe... hotel? We need place to stay.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, I'll look into some options and we can decide together. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I think that is all. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm excited for our trip. Let's finalize everything soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I am excited too. See you soon!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you soon! Take care until then.
