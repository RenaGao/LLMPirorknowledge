**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How's your morning routine these days?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! My morning routine... um, it is simple. I wake up at six o'clock.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's early! What do you do after you wake up?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** After wake up, I... how to say... I do exercise. Just a little, like stretching.

**Speaker A (NS):** Stretching is a great way to start the day. Do you have breakfast after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I have breakfast. I eat rice and miso soup. Sometimes, I eat... um, egg.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds delicious! Do you make your breakfast yourself?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I make it. It is not difficult. I like cooking.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's nice. What do you do after breakfast?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** After breakfast, I... um, I read news. I use my phone for this.

**Speaker A (NS):** Keeping up with the news is important. Do you have time for anything else before work or school?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I prepare for work. I check my bag and... um, make sure I have everything.

**Speaker A (NS):** Being prepared is always good. Do you commute far?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, not far. I take train. It is about 20 minutes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's convenient. Do you listen to music or read on the train?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I listen to music. It is relaxing for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Music is a great way to relax. Do you have a favorite artist?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I like... how to say... many artist. But, I like J-Pop very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** J-Pop is fun! Well, it sounds like you have a nice morning routine.
