**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can you tell me about a recent memorable event in your life?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Um, last week, I go to... how to say... a festival? In my town.

**Speaker A (NS):** A festival? That sounds exciting! What kind of festival was it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It was... um, traditional festival. We have many... uh, food and games.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I love traditional festivals! What was your favorite part?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like... um, the food. There is... how to say... sweet rice ball? 

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, mochi! Those are delicious. Did you try any games?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I try... um, catching fish game. It was very fun, but difficult.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! How did the festival make you feel?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I feel very... um, happy and... relaxed. It was nice to see many people.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful. Festivals can really bring people together.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is true. I enjoy very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to hear that. Do you often go to festivals?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not often, but I want to go more. They are... um, special time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, they are special. Thank you for sharing your experience with me.
