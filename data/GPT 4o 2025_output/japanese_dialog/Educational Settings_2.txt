**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, everyone! Today, we're discussing the topic of photosynthesis. Does anyone have questions or need clarification?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes, I have question. Photosynthesis is... how to say... process for plant to make food, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! It's the process plants use to convert sunlight into energy. Do you want to know more about how it works?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, please. I understand sunlight is important, but... um, what else plant need?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! Besides sunlight, plants need water and carbon dioxide. These are the main ingredients for photosynthesis.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. And, um, what is product? What plant make?

**Speaker A (NS):** Plants produce glucose, which is a type of sugar, and oxygen. The glucose is used as food, and the oxygen is released into the air.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oxygen, yes. I remember now. But, um, how plant take carbon dioxide?

**Speaker A (NS):** Plants absorb carbon dioxide through small openings called stomata, usually found on the leaves. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, stomata. I understand. But, um, why photosynthesis important for us?

**Speaker A (NS):** Photosynthesis is crucial because it provides oxygen for us to breathe and is the foundation of the food chain. Without it, life on Earth wouldn't exist as we know it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, very important! I think I understand better now. Thank you for explain.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm glad it helped. Do you have any other questions?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No more question. I will study more at home. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! If you think of more questions later, feel free to ask. 

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day, everyone!
