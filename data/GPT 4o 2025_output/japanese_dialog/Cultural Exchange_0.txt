**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m curious to learn about some traditions or festivals from Japan. Can you tell me about one?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, of course. Um, in Japan, we have festival called... how to say... Cherry Blossom Festival?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the Cherry Blossom Festival! That sounds beautiful. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is very beautiful. We call it "Hanami." People go to park and... um, look at cherry blossoms. We eat food and drink under the trees.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. Is there a special time of year for Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is in spring. Usually, um, March or April. It depend on weather, when flowers bloom.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do people do anything special during Hanami besides eating and drinking?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, sometimes we sing songs or play games. It is time for... um, how to say... relax and enjoy nature.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful way to enjoy the season. Do families usually go together?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, families, friends, and sometimes coworkers. It is very... um, social event.

**Speaker A (NS):** It must be a great way to connect with others. Is there any traditional food people eat during Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we eat bento, like lunch box. And also, um, sakura mochi, sweet rice cake with cherry leaf.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sakura mochi sounds delicious! Is there anything else you’d like to share about Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes. It is important to respect nature and clean up after. We say, "leave no trace."

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great practice. Thank you for sharing about Hanami. It sounds like a beautiful tradition.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you for listening. I hope you can see cherry blossoms one day.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to! It was nice talking with you. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you. Have a nice day too! Goodbye!
