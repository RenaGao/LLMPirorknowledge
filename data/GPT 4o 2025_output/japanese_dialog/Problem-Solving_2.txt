**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello! I am good, thank you. Um, I have... how to say... small problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, what happened? Can I help?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, please. I, um, make mistake with report. I send wrong file to manager.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Did you send the correct file afterward?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not yet. I, um, not sure how to say sorry and fix it.

**Speaker A (NS):** You can write an email saying, "I apologize for sending the wrong file. Here is the correct one."

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I will write, "I apologize for... um, sending wrong file. Here is correct one."

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And maybe add, "Please let me know if there are any issues."

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will add that. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Mistakes happen, and it’s good you’re fixing it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I learn from mistake. I will be more careful next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great attitude, Yuki. Is there anything else you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, no, I think that is all. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! If you need anything else, just let me know.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, take care, Yuki. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! Goodbye!
