**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, please. I am looking for... um, how to say... big park? 

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean the Central Park? It's quite popular here.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, Central Park! I want to go there. How I can go?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, it's not too far. You can walk straight down this street for about ten minutes.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Walk straight... ten minutes. Okay. And then?

**Speaker A (NS):** Then you'll see a big fountain. Turn left there, and the park entrance will be on your right.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, turn left at fountain. Entrance is right side. I understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you need any help with anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, is there... how to say... place for eat near park?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, there are a few cafes and restaurants around the park. Do you like any specific type of food?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like... um, sandwich and coffee. Is there place like that?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, there's a nice café called "Green Leaf" just outside the park. They have good sandwiches and coffee.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Green Leaf café. Thank you very much. I will try it.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Enjoy your time at the park and the café.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care!
