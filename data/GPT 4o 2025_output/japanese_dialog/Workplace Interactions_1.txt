**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Welcome to the team. Today, I’ll explain how we handle our project reports. Do you have any questions before we start?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, thank you. I am happy to join. Um, I have little question. What is... project report?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! A project report is a document where we summarize our progress and results. We do this every month.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see. So, we write about what we do in project, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. We include what we’ve accomplished, any challenges, and our next steps. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it make sense. Um, how to start writing it?

**Speaker A (NS):** First, gather all your data and notes from the month. Then, organize them into sections like introduction, progress, and conclusion.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, okay. I need to collect data and make... um, sections?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s right. And don’t worry, we have a template to help you. I can send it to you.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, template is very helpful. Thank you. I will use it.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! After you fill out the template, you can review it for any errors or missing information.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Review is important, yes. I will check carefully.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Once you’re done, you’ll submit it to our project manager by the end of the month.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Submit to manager... um, by last day of month?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly. And if you have any questions while writing, feel free to ask me.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I will ask if I need help. Um, I try my best.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you’ll do great! Let’s meet again next week to see how it’s going.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, next week is good. Thank you for help today.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Have a great day, and see you next week!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you next week! Have a nice day!
