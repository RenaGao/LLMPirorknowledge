**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you looking to buy something today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I want to buy... um, how to say... a bag. For travel.

**Speaker A (NS):** A travel bag? Great! Do you have a specific type in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I like the big one. But, um, price is... how to say... important?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. You want a good price. Have you seen any bags you like?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, this one. It is nice, but... um, expensive, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. How much is it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It is... um, 50 dollars. Can I... um, ask for less?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, you can negotiate. Maybe you can offer 40 dollars and see what they say.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, okay. I try. Um, excuse me, can I buy this for 40 dollars?

**Vendor (imaginary):** Hmm, 40 dollars is a bit low. How about 45 dollars?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, 45... I think is okay. Yes, I will take it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great job! You got a better price.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. It is... um, good practice for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Negotiating can be tricky, but you did well.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I learn much today. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Enjoy your new bag.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Thank you. Um, see you next time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. See you next time! Have a great day.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! Goodbye!
