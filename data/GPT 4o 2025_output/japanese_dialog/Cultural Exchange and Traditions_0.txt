**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! It's great to see you. I was wondering if you could tell me about a tradition or festival from Japan. I'm really curious!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! Yes, I can. Um, in Japan, we have festival called... how to say... Cherry Blossom Festival?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, Hanami! We, uh, go to park and see cherry blossoms. Very beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. Do you do anything special during Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we have picnic under tree. We eat, um, bento... and drink sake. It is very fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful way to enjoy spring. Is it a family event or more with friends?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Both! Family and friends. Everyone enjoy together. Sometimes, we sing and dance too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That must be a great atmosphere. How long does the festival last?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It is, um, short. Maybe one week or two weeks. Depends on weather and flowers.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you have a favorite memory from Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, when I was child, I go with family. We play games and, um, eat special sweets. Very happy memory.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful. I’d love to experience it someday. Is there anything else special about Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. At night, we have... how to say... light up? 

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean the cherry blossoms are illuminated?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, illuminated! It is very beautiful at night. 

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds magical. Thank you for sharing, Yuki. I really appreciate it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome! I am happy to tell you. 

**Speaker A (NS):** I hope I can join you for Hanami one day. It sounds amazing.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, please come! We can enjoy together.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that. Thanks again, Yuki. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, talk soon! Goodbye!
