**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello! Um, I have question about homework. It is... a little confusing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, no problem. What part of the homework is confusing for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, it is the math problem. Number three, I think. I not understand... how to solve.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let’s take a look. Is it the one about fractions?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, fractions. I not sure how to... um, add them together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, when you add fractions, you need a common denominator. Do you know what that means?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Common... denominator? Um, no, I not know.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s the same number at the bottom of both fractions. You need to make them the same before adding.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. So, I change bottom number to same?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Once they’re the same, you can add the top numbers.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I try this. Thank you for explain.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Do you have any other questions about the homework?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, no more question. I think I understand now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! If you need more help, feel free to ask anytime.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Thank you very much for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Yuki. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! Goodbye!
