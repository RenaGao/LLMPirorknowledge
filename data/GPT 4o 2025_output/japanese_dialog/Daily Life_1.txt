**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, not yet. I think about... how to say... family picnic?

**Speaker A (NS):** A family picnic sounds lovely! Do you know where you want to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, maybe park near my house. It is... um, very big and have many trees.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. Do you have any activities planned for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. We play... um, ball game? And maybe... how to say... fly kite?

**Speaker A (NS):** Playing ball games and flying kites sounds fun! What about food? Have you thought about what to bring?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I bring... um, sandwiches and onigiri. My mother make... um, special salad.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sandwiches and onigiri are a great combination! What kind of salad does your mother make?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, maybe five people. My parents, my sister, and... um, my cousin.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a nice group. Do you need to prepare anything else for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I need... um, blanket and... how to say... cooler box for drinks.

**Speaker A (NS):** A blanket and a cooler box are essential. Do you have everything you need?
