**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, everyone! Thanks for joining the meeting planning session. Shall we start by deciding on the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Thank you. Um, first, maybe we talk about project update?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea. We can start with project updates. Anything else we should include?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, how to say... budget? We need to discuss budget, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, discussing the budget is important. We’ll add that to the agenda. Any other topics?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, maybe... team building? We can plan activity for team.

**Speaker A (NS):** Team building activities sound fun! We can definitely include that. Is there anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I think, um, timeline. We need to check timeline for project.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, reviewing the project timeline is crucial. So, we have project updates, budget, team building, and timeline. Does that cover everything?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I think it is good. Um, what time we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about we meet on Thursday at 10 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thursday, 10 a.m. is okay. I will prepare, um, presentation for update.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll send out a calendar invite with the agenda. Anything else you’d like to add?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I think it is all. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Thank you for your input. Looking forward to our meeting.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, me too. See you on Thursday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a great day!
