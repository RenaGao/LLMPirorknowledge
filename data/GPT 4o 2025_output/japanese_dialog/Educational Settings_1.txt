**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! Um, I am little nervous. Test is... how to say... difficult?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It can be challenging. Have you started studying yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I start study. I read textbook and make notes. But, um, I not sure if enough.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start. Do you use any other study methods?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, I try to, um, practice with friend. We ask question each other.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! Sometimes explaining things to others helps you understand better.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, yes. It help me remember. Do you have, um, other tips?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! I like to use flashcards for key terms. It’s a quick way to review.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Flashcards... ah, I see. I will try that. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Also, taking short breaks can help keep your mind fresh.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Breaks are good. I sometimes forget to take.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s easy to forget when you’re focused. Just remember to rest a bit.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I will remember. Um, do you think test will be very hard?

**Speaker A (NS):** It might be tough, but if you prepare well, you’ll do fine.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I hope so. I will study more this weekend.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a solid plan. Let me know if you need any help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Good luck with your studying.
