**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! Thanks for meeting with me. We need to figure out how to handle the project deadline. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! Yes, um, I think we need more time. The project is, uh, very big, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree, it’s quite extensive. Do you think we should ask for an extension?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, maybe we can ask. But, um, how to say... we need good reason?

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, we should have a solid reason. Maybe we can explain the extra research needed?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, research is important. And also, um, testing takes long time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good point. Testing is crucial. Should we prepare a report to show our progress?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, report is good. We can show what we finish and what is left.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. I can help with the report. Would you like to draft the first part?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, I can do first part. I write about research, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll cover the testing section. When do you think you can have your draft ready?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, maybe by, uh, next Monday? Is that okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** That works for me. Let’s aim to review it together on Tuesday.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, Tuesday is good. We can, um, fix any mistake then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. I’ll start gathering the testing data.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I will, uh, focus on research part.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great teamwork, Yuki. Let’s keep each other updated.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we will do that. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Let’s make sure we’re ready for Tuesday. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, talk soon. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Yuki!
