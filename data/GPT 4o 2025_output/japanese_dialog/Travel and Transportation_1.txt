**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, please. I am looking for hotel... um, nearby hotel.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is... um, "Green Park Hotel."

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Green Park Hotel is not far from here. Do you have a map or a phone with GPS?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I have phone, but GPS... not working well.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Let me guide you. You need to go straight on this street for about two blocks.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Two blocks, okay. Then, what I do?

**Speaker A (NS):** After two blocks, you will see a big supermarket on your right. Turn left there.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Turn left at supermarket, yes. And then?

**Speaker A (NS):** Keep walking for another block, and you will see the hotel on your right side.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. Walk one more block, hotel is right side.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Do you need any more help with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, thank you. I think I understand. You are very kind.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Enjoy your stay at the hotel.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you very much. I will try to find it now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Safe travels! If you need more help, feel free to ask someone nearby.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I will. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day!
