**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Yuki! We’re thinking of planning a surprise party for Tom. Would you like to help us?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! Yes, I want to help. Um, what we need to do first?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! First, we need to decide on a location. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, maybe... how to say... park? Or, um, someone’s house?

**Speaker A (NS):** A park could be nice if the weather is good. Do you think Tom would like that?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I think he like park. He enjoy outside, um, nature.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! We’ll check the weather forecast. Next, we need to think about food. Any suggestions?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Food... maybe, um, barbecue? Or, uh, pizza is easy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Barbecue sounds fun! We can also have some snacks and drinks. What about decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Decorations... ah, balloons and, um, banner? Happy Birthday banner?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, balloons and a banner would be great. Do you know where we can get those?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I can check, um, store near my house. They have many party things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome, thank you! Lastly, we should plan some activities. Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Activities... maybe, um, games? Like, uh, how to say... treasure hunt?

**Speaker A (NS):** A treasure hunt sounds exciting! We can organize that. Let’s meet again to finalize everything.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, let’s meet. Um, when is good time for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this Saturday afternoon?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Saturday is good. I will bring, um, list of things we need.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Thanks for your help, Yuki. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you Saturday! Thank you for inviting me to help. Bye!
