**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! I heard you were upset about something I said yesterday. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello. Yes, um, I was little confused. You say... how to say... you not like my idea?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. I think there was a misunderstanding. I didn't mean I didn't like your idea. I just thought we could explore more options.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I understand now. I think maybe I hear wrong. Sorry for that.

**Speaker A (NS):** No need to apologize! Communication can be tricky sometimes. I'm glad we can clear it up.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you. I feel better now. Um, your idea was also good. We can use both, maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Combining both ideas could be really effective. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I think it is good. We can make... um, how to say... a strong plan together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, a strong plan. I'm glad we talked about this. Is there anything else you want to discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I think that is all. Thank you for listening.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Yuki. It's important to me that we understand each other.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, very important. I will try to listen more careful next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** And I'll make sure to be clearer with my words. We make a good team!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, good team! I am happy we talk.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Let's keep communicating openly. 

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I agree. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Yuki. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Talk to you soon!
