**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you planning any trips with your friends soon?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. We want to go to, um, New York City. It is very exciting place, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! Have you been there before?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I never go there before. It is first time for me and my friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any specific places you want to visit in New York?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes. We want to see, uh, Statue of Liberty and, um, Central Park. Also, maybe Times Square.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those are all must-see spots! How are you planning to get around the city?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We think subway is good. It is, um, fast and not expensive, I hear.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the subway is a convenient way to travel. Have you looked into where you’ll stay?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. We find hotel near, um, Times Square. It is easy to go many places from there.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a smart choice. What about food? Any particular dishes you want to try?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we want to try, um, New York pizza and maybe, uh, bagels. They are famous, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, you’ll love them! Do you have any plans for the evenings?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, maybe we see Broadway show. It is, uh, very popular, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a fantastic idea! Have you decided on which show to see?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not yet. We need to, um, check what is available. Maybe, uh, musical?

**Speaker A (NS):** Musicals are a great choice. Let me know if you need any recommendations.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I will ask if we need help. Um, we are very excited for this trip.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you’ll have a wonderful time. Is there anything else you need to plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, no, I think we are ready. Just need to pack and, uh, go!

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like you’re all set. Have a fantastic trip, and let me know how it goes!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you very much! I will tell you all about it. Goodbye!
