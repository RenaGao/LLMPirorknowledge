**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Do you have any plans for this evening?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, not yet. I think about going out. Maybe dinner?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice! Do you have a restaurant in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I not sure. I like... how to say... Italian food?

**Speaker A (NS):** Italian food is great! There’s a nice place downtown. Have you been there before?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I not go before. Is it... um, good price?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it’s reasonably priced. They have delicious pasta and pizza.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, I like pizza! Maybe we can go there. After, we do something?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! What do you feel like doing after dinner?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, maybe... movie? Or, how to say... walk in park?

**Speaker A (NS):** Both sound good! There’s a nice park nearby. We could walk there.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, park is nice. I like nature. Movie maybe next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, dinner at the Italian place and then a walk in the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is good plan. What time we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 6:30 p.m. at the restaurant?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** 6:30 p.m. is okay. I will be there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Looking forward to it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Me too! Thank you for plan. See you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! See you this evening!
