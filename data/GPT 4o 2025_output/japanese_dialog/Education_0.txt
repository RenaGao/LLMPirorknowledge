**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! How are you feeling about the exam next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! Um, I am little nervous. The exam is... how to say... very important.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s a big one. Have you started studying yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I start study. But, I have problem with... um, the history part.

**Speaker A (NS):** History can be tricky. Is there a specific topic you find difficult?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, the... um, dates and events. I forget them easy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe try making a timeline. It can help visualize the order of events.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Timeline? Ah, yes, that is good idea. I will try it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! How about the math section? Are you comfortable with it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Math is... um, okay. But sometimes, I confuse with formula.

**Speaker A (NS):** Practice is key. Maybe we can study together and go over some problems?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, yes! That would be very helpful. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! We can meet at the library this weekend if you’re free.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I am free. What time is good for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about Saturday at 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, 2 p.m. is good. I will bring my notes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! We’ll tackle those tricky parts together.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you very much. I feel better now.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Yuki. We’ll do great. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you Saturday! Goodbye!
