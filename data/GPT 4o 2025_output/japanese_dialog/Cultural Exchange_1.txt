**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuki! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I was thinking about how different dining etiquette can be in different cultures. Have you noticed any differences between Japan and here?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. In Japan, we say "Itadakimasu" before eating. It is like... um, how to say... giving thanks for the food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that's interesting! Here, some people say grace or a short prayer before meals. Do you have any other customs?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we also use chopsticks. But, um, not stick them in rice. It is... bad meaning.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, I heard that's considered disrespectful. Here, we mostly use forks and knives. Do you find it difficult to use them?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** At first, yes. But now, I am okay. Sometimes, I still use chopsticks if I can.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! What about tipping? I know it's different in Japan.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, in Japan, no tipping. It is not... um, expected. But here, it is important, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, tipping is a big part of dining out here. It can be confusing for visitors. Do you have any favorite foods from here?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like... um, how to say... hamburger and pizza. They are very delicious!

**Speaker A (NS):** Those are popular choices! Have you tried any traditional Japanese dishes here?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I find sushi restaurant. It is good, but not same as Japan.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine. Authentic flavors can be hard to find. Do you miss any specific Japanese food?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I miss ramen. It is... um, comfort food for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ramen is delicious! Maybe we can find a good place together sometime.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that would be nice. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! It's always fun to explore different cuisines. Well, I should get going. It was great talking with you, Yuki.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thank you for conversation. See you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you soon! Take care!
