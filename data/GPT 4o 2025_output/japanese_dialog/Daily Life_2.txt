**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I heard you like cooking. Can you tell me how you prepare your favorite meal?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, I like cooking. My favorite is... um, how to say... Japanese curry.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Japanese curry sounds delicious! How do you make it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** First, I cut... um, vegetables. Like potato, carrot, and onion.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good. Do you use any meat?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I use chicken. I cut chicken into... um, small pieces.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What do you do next?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Then, I fry... um, fry chicken and vegetables in pan. With oil.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you add the curry sauce after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I add curry... um, curry roux. And water. Let it... um, cook for a while.

**Speaker A (NS):** How long do you let it cook?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe... 20 minutes? Until it is... um, thick.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect. Do you serve it with anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I serve with rice. Japanese rice is... um, sticky and good.

**Speaker A (NS):** I love sticky rice! Do you make it often?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I make often. It is easy and... um, everyone like it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to try it sometime. Maybe you can show me how to make it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, of course! I can show you. It is... um, fun to cook together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great! Thanks for sharing your recipe with me.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome. I am happy to share.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I’ll see you later then!
