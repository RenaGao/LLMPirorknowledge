**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It's been a while since we last talked. How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! Yes, long time no see. I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks for asking. So, what have you been up to lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I have been busy with work. I work in, uh, marketing now. It is... how to say... very busy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, marketing sounds interesting! What kind of projects are you working on?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is interesting. I work on, um, campaign for new product. We make... advertisement? Yes, advertisement.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds exciting! Are you enjoying it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I enjoy. But sometimes, it is difficult. Many meetings and... um, deadlines.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine. Deadlines can be stressful. Do you have any plans to relax this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I plan to visit, um, how to say... hot spring? Onsen.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds perfect! Onsen are so relaxing. Are you going with friends or family?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I go with friends. We like to, um, enjoy nature and relax.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great plan. I hope you have a wonderful time.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! And you, do you have plan for weekend?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm planning to catch up on some reading and maybe go for a hike. Nothing too exciting.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hiking is nice. Good for health, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! It's a great way to stay active. Well, it was really nice catching up with you.
