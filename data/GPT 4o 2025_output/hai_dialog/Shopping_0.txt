**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can I help you find something today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes, please. I look for... how to say... thing for write on paper.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you mean a pen or a pencil?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, pen. I need pen for my work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, we have a variety of pens. Are you looking for a specific type, like a ballpoint or a gel pen?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I not sure. What is... um, different?

**Speaker A (NS):** A ballpoint pen uses oil-based ink, which is less likely to smudge. A gel pen uses water-based ink, which is smoother but can smudge more easily.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, I see. I think I want ballpoint. It is better for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! They’re right over here. Do you have a color preference?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like blue color. It is easy to see.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, we have blue ballpoint pens here. Would you like a single pen or a pack?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe pack. I use many for work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, here’s a pack of blue ballpoint pens. Is there anything else you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I need... um, thing for fixing paper together.

**Speaker A (NS):** A stapler?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, stapler. I need small one.

**Speaker A (NS):** We have mini staplers right here. Would you like to see them?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, please. I think this one is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent choice. Is there anything else I can help you with?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, thank you. You help me very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! If you need anything else, feel free to ask. Have a great day!
