**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I heard we're planning a group vacation. Do you have any ideas for where we should go?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes. I think maybe we go to beach? Like, um, Phuket or Krabi.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! Both are beautiful places. Do you have a preference between the two?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think Krabi is nice. I hear it have many, um, how to say... beautiful rock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you mean the limestone cliffs? Yes, Krabi is famous for those. What activities do you want to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, limestone cliffs! I want to, um, swim and maybe try... um, kayak?

**Speaker A (NS):** Kayaking sounds fun! We can explore the caves and islands. How about snorkeling? 

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Snorkeling, yes! I like to see fish. Many color fish, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, the marine life is amazing there. How long do you think we should stay?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe three day? Or four day? Enough for relax and see everything.

**Speaker A (NS):** Four days sounds perfect. We can take our time and enjoy. Should we book a hotel or a resort?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think resort is good. More, um, comfortable and near beach.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! I'll look into some options. Do you want to help with the booking?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I can help. I find some place online and we choose together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let's meet tomorrow to finalize everything. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, tomorrow is good. We meet and plan more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! I'm excited for this trip. Thanks for your help, Lek.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you too! I am happy to plan with you. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow, Lek! Have a great day!
