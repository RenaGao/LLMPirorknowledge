**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I heard you like cooking. Can you tell me about your favorite meal and how you prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! I like to cook... um, Thai food. My favorite is Pad Thai. You know it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I love Pad Thai! How do you make it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** First, I need noodle. Um, rice noodle. I soak in water, not too long. Maybe... 30 minutes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, soaking the noodles. What’s next?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Then, I cook... um, how to say... shrimp and tofu in pan. With oil.

**Speaker A (NS):** You fry the shrimp and tofu in oil?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, fry. And I add garlic, very important. Make good smell.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds delicious! What do you add after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** After, I put noodle in pan. And sauce. Sauce is... um, tamarind, fish sauce, sugar.

**Speaker A (NS):** So you mix the noodles with tamarind, fish sauce, and sugar?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, mix well. Then, I add egg. I push noodle to side, cook egg.

**Speaker A (NS):** You cook the egg in the same pan?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, same pan. Then mix all together. Add bean sprout and peanut.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! Do you serve it with anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like lime and chili powder. Make spicy and sour.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can’t wait to try it! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You welcome! I hope you like it. Maybe we cook together sometime?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Let’s plan for it soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, good idea. Thank you for listen. See you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you! Have a great day!
