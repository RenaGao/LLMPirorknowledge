**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, is this Lek? It's Sarah, your cousin from the States.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, hello Sarah! Yes, I am Lek. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thank you! How about you? How's everything in Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I am good, thank you. Thailand is, um, very hot now. But, uh, everything is okay.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! So, what have you been up to lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I, um, work at office. And I also, uh, learn English more. It is, um, sometimes hard.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great that you're learning English! If you need any help, feel free to ask me.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, Sarah. I will ask if I need. Um, how is your family?

**Speaker A (NS):** They're doing well, thanks for asking. My kids are growing up fast. Do you remember them?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I remember. They are, um, very cute. How old are they now?

**Speaker A (NS):** They're 8 and 10 now. Time flies! Do you have any plans to visit us?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I want to visit, but, um, maybe next year. I need to, uh, save money first.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. We'd love to have you here. Let me know when you plan to come.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will tell you. I want to see, um, many places in America.

**Speaker A (NS):** There are so many great places to visit. We can plan some trips together.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That is good idea! I am excited to see you all.

**Speaker A (NS):** We're excited too! Well, it was great catching up with you, Lek.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, very nice to talk with you, Sarah. Thank you for call.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Take care and talk soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, talk soon. Goodbye, Sarah!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Lek!
