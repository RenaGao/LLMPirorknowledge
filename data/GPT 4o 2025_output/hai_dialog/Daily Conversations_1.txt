**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! Um, I not have plan yet. You have idea?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about going to the park? We could have a picnic and relax.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, that sound nice! Which park you think?

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe Central Park? It's big and has lots of space.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, Central Park is good. I like it. We can, um, walk around too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, how about... ten o'clock in morning?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten sounds perfect. Should we bring some food?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I can bring, um, Thai food. You like?

**Speaker A (NS):** I love Thai food! I'll bring some drinks and snacks.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Good! I will make, um, pad thai. Is okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Pad Thai is great! Do you need any help with it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I can do. Thank you. You bring, um, juice maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I'll bring some juice. Anything else we need?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think that all. We have food and drink.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! I'm looking forward to it.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Me too! We will have fun. See you Saturday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you on Saturday, Lek! Have a great day until then.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! You too. Bye!
