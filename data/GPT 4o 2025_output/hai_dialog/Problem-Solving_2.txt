**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! I am good, thank you. Um, I have... how to say... a small problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, what happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I, um, forget to send email to you yesterday. I am very sorry.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay, Lek. We all make mistakes. Did you manage to send it today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I send it this morning. I hope it is not too late.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, it's not too late. Thank you for sending it. Is there anything else you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think... maybe check if everything is correct in email?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can do that. Do you want me to give you feedback?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, please. I want to make sure it is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I'll review it and let you know. Anything else on your mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think that is all. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Lek. I'm glad to help. If you have more questions, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I will. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Lek! Talk to you soon.
