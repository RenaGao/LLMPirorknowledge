**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I heard we’re planning a surprise party for Nuch. Are you excited?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, very excited! Um, I think it will be fun. We need to plan, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Do you have any ideas for the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think maybe we can do at park. Nuch like nature, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea! Do you know which park would be best?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, how to say... the big park with many trees... Chatuchak Park?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, Chatuchak Park sounds perfect. What about food and drinks?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I can bring some Thai food. Maybe, um, pad thai and spring rolls?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! I can bring some drinks. Do you think Nuch will like that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, Nuch like pad thai very much. And drinks, yes, good idea.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What time should we meet at the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe... um, ten o'clock? Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten o'clock works for me. Should we tell others to come at the same time?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, tell them. We can all meet and set up together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll send a message to everyone. Anything else we need to plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe music? Nuch like music, so we can play some.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! I’ll bring a speaker. Do you have a playlist in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I can make playlist. I know Nuch favorite songs.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! I think we’re all set then. Thanks for your help, Lek.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you too! I am happy to help. See you at the park!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you there! Have a great day until then.
