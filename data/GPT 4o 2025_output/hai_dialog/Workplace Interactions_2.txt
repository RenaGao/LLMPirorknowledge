**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! Thanks for joining the call. Are you ready to plan our team meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! Yes, I am ready. We need to talk about, um, the meeting... what we do in meeting?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, we need to decide on the agenda. Do you have any topics in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think we talk about new project. It is important, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, discussing the new project is a great idea. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe we also talk about, uh, team... how to say... team work? How we work together better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Team collaboration, right? That's a good point. We can include that.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, collaboration. And, um, maybe we need to talk about budget too?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, we can add budget discussion to the agenda. Do you think we should also review last quarter's performance?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, review is good. We see what we do well and not well.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, so we have the new project, team collaboration, budget, and performance review. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think that is all. Maybe we finish with, um, how to say... future plan?

**Speaker A (NS):** Future planning, yes. That sounds like a comprehensive agenda. What time should we schedule the meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe 10 o'clock? Is that okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** 10 a.m. works for me. I'll send out the invites. Does that sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, good. I will prepare some, um, notes for meeting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, Lek. Thank you for your help. Anything else before we wrap up?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I think we are ready. Thank you for, um, your help too.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Looking forward to the meeting. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! See you at meeting. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Lek!
