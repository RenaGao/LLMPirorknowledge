**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can you tell me about a recent achievement you're proud of?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes. I, uh, finish my first marathon last month.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that's amazing! How long did you train for it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I train... um, about six month. It was very hard, but I do it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Six months is a long time. What was the most challenging part for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** The most... um, difficult is waking up early. I not like morning, but I must run before work.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Early mornings can be tough. How did you feel when you crossed the finish line?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I feel very happy and, um, proud. It is like... big success for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's wonderful! What does completing the marathon mean to you personally?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It mean I can do hard thing if I try. Um, it give me more... how to say... confidence?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, confidence. That's a great takeaway. Do you plan to run another marathon?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe, yes. I want to try again, but need more time to prepare.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. It's important to be ready. Is there anything else you learned from this experience?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I learn to, um, not give up. Even when tired, I keep going.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a valuable lesson. I'm sure it will help you in other areas of life too.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I think so. It help me with work and study also.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to hear that. Thank you for sharing your story with me.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you for listen. I happy to talk about it.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. It was inspiring to hear. Take care and good luck with your future marathons!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! Goodbye, see you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Looking forward to it!
