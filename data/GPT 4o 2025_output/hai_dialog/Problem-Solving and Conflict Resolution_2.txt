**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! Thanks for meeting with me. We need to figure out how to handle the project deadline. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! Yes, um, I think we can, uh, make a plan. Maybe we work more hours this week?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good start. Do you think we should prioritize certain tasks first?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes. We do important thing first. Like, um, finish the report. It is, uh, how to say... most urgent?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, the report is the most urgent. Should we divide the tasks between us?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I think so. I can do, um, data analysis part. I am good with numbers.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I can handle the writing and editing. How about we check in every day to see our progress?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, check every day is good. We can, um, fix problem fast if we talk.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Do you have any concerns about the timeline?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe... if we have more work, we need help. Can we ask, uh, other team?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we can definitely ask for help if needed. Let's keep that as an option.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, good. I feel better now. We have plan.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to hear that. Let's start tomorrow morning. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, tomorrow morning is good. I will be ready.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent. Thanks for your input, Lek. We'll get through this together.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you too. I am happy to work with you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Likewise! Let's touch base tomorrow. Have a great evening!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you tomorrow. Have a nice evening!
