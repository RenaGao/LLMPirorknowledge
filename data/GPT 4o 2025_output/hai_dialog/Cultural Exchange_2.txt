**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! I was curious, could you tell me about your favorite holiday in Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! Um, my favorite holiday is Songkran. It is, uh, Thai New Year.

**Speaker A (NS):** Songkran sounds interesting! What do people usually do during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We, um, we have water fight. Very fun! People throw water... um, to each other.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! Is there a special meaning behind the water?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, water is for, um, clean... how to say... wash away bad luck.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. It's like a fresh start for the new year. Do you celebrate with your family?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, family is important. We, um, visit temple and, uh, give food to monk.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds very meaningful. Do you have any special foods during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we eat... um, khao chae. It is rice in cold water with, uh, side dish.

**Speaker A (NS):** Khao chae sounds delicious! Is it a traditional dish for Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, very traditional. Only eat in Songkran time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Iâ€™d love to try it someday. How long does the Songkran festival last?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is, um, three days. But some place, maybe more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, three days of celebration! Do you have a favorite part of the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like, um, water fight most. Very happy and, uh, everyone smile.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a joyful time. Thank you for sharing about Songkran with me, Lek.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You are welcome! I happy to tell you.

**Speaker A (NS):** I appreciate it. Let's talk more about it another time. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, you too! See you later!
