**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Lek, I wanted to talk about our plan for Saturday. Are you still free?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! Yes, I am free. We go to park, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Actually, I thought we were going to the museum. Did you mean the park instead?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, um, I think we say park. Maybe I mistake. Museum is okay too.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! We can go to the park if you prefer. Do you want to change the plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, park is good. I like to walk and see tree. How to say... relax?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, relax. That sounds nice. What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe... 10 o'clock? Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** 10 o'clock works for me. Should we bring some snacks?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I bring food. You bring drink, maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I'll bring some drinks. Do you have any preferences?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like juice. Orange juice is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, I'll get some orange juice. Anything else you want to do at the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe take photo? I like photo.

**Speaker A (NS):** Taking photos sounds fun! We can capture some nice moments.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, very good. I happy we go park.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too, Lek. I'm glad we sorted this out. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you Saturday. Thank you for talk.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Have a great day until then.
