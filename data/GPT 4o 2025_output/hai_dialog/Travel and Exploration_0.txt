**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! Are you excited about planning our trip to the new city?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, very excited! Um, I think it will be fun. We go with friends, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We’ll be a group of five. Have you thought about where you’d like to visit first?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hmm, I want to see... how to say... the big building? Um, famous one.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, do you mean the skyscraper? Like a famous tower?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes! Skyscraper. I hear it very nice view.

**Speaker A (NS):** It definitely is. We can start there. What about food? Any special places you want to try?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like to try local food. Maybe, um, street food? Is it good there?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, the street food is amazing. We can explore a food market. Do you have any dietary preferences?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I eat everything. But, um, not too spicy, please.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it, we’ll find something mild. How about transportation? Should we rent a car or use public transport?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think public transport is good. Um, cheaper and easy, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it’s convenient and cost-effective. We can get a travel card for the city.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Good idea! And, um, where we stay? Hotel or...?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking of booking an Airbnb. It’s more comfortable for a group. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, Airbnb is nice. We can cook together maybe.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! We can plan a dinner night. Anything else you’d like to do?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe visit museum? I like history.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, we can add a museum to our itinerary. Let’s finalize the plan soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, let’s do that. I will tell other friends too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Thanks, Lek! I’ll send you the details later.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I look forward to it. See you soon!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you, Lek! Take care!
