**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! Are you thinking about buying a new phone today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I want to buy new phone. My old one is, um, very slow now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. What features are you looking for in a new phone?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I want good camera. I like take photo, um, picture of family and friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** A good camera is important. Do you also need a lot of storage for your photos?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, storage is good. I have many, um, how to say... apps and music.

**Speaker A (NS):** So, a phone with a lot of storage and a good camera. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Battery life. I need phone that last long time. I use it all day.

**Speaker A (NS):** Long battery life is definitely useful. Do you have a budget in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes, I think not too expensive. Maybe, um, around 300 dollars?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds reasonable. Have you looked at any specific models yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I see one, um, Samsung Galaxy A series. It look nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** The Galaxy A series is a good choice. It has a decent camera and battery life.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, and price is okay. I think I will buy it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! Do you need help with anything else before you decide?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I think I am ready. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Lek! I'm glad I could help. Let me know how you like the phone.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will tell you. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Lek! Enjoy your new phone!
