**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I’m curious to learn about different cultures. Can you tell me about a tradition or festival from Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! We have Songkran Festival. It is, um, very famous in Thailand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Songkran? What is it about?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is Thai New Year. We celebrate in April. People, um, throw water to each other.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Is there a special meaning behind the water?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, water is for, um, cleaning. It is like... how to say... washing away bad luck.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you have any other activities during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we also visit temple. We, um, make merit and give food to monk.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting. Is it a family event?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, family come together. We, um, respect elder and pour water on their hand.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a beautiful tradition. How long does the festival last?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is three day, but some place celebrate longer.
