**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! How's your day going?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! My day is good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I was thinking, maybe we could plan an evening out this weekend. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! I like that idea. Um, where you want to go?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking about trying a new restaurant. Do you have any preferences?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hmm, I like spicy food. Maybe Thai restaurant? Or, um, something different?

**Speaker A (NS):** Thai sounds great! But if you want to try something new, how about Mexican food?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Mexican food? Yes, I never try before. It is spicy too, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it can be spicy! They have great flavors. Do you want to go there?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I want to try. What time we go?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 7 p.m.? Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, 7 p.m. is good. After dinner, we do something else?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! We could go for a walk or maybe see a movie. What do you prefer?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think walk is nice. Weather is good now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! We can walk by the river. It's really beautiful at night.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like that. Very relaxing. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! So, we'll meet at the restaurant at 7 p.m. and then take a walk after.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is good plan. I look forward to it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too, Lek! See you on the weekend.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, see you! Have a nice day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Bye!
