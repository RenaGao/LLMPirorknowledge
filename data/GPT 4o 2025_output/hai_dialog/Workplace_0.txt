**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek. Can we discuss the project deadline today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um, I want to talk about it. The deadline is, uh, next Friday, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's correct. How is the progress so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is going well, but I have, um, some problem with the data part. 

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Can you explain the issue a bit more?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, the data is, um, not... how to say... not matching? I try to fix, but it take time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you need any help with that? Maybe we can find a solution together.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, help is good. I think, um, we need more time for this part.

**Speaker A (NS):** How much more time do you think you'll need?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe, um, two more days? I can work hard to finish.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, let's extend the deadline to next Wednesday. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is good. Thank you for understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. It's important to get it right. Anything else you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think that is all. I will update you, uh, tomorrow.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Let me know if you need anything else.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Lek. Let's make sure we meet the new deadline.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we will. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Have a good day, Lek.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Goodbye!
