**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! I heard you’re planning a cultural event. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um, I want to show Thai culture. We have, uh, food, dance, and... how to say... traditional clothes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! What kind of food will you have?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We will have, um, pad thai, and also... green curry. Very delicious!

**Speaker A (NS):** Yum, I love pad thai! Will there be any performances?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we have Thai dance. It is, um, very beautiful and... slow, with music.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing. How about the traditional clothes? Will people be able to try them on?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we have some clothes for, um, people to wear. They can take photo, too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! How can people join the event?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** They can, um, sign up online. We have website for register.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Do you need any help with organizing?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe help with, uh, setting up tables and chairs. It is a lot of work.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d be happy to help with that. What time should I come?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Can you come at, um, 9 a.m.? We start prepare early.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’ll be there at 9 a.m. Is there anything else I should bring?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe, um, some water bottles? It can be hot.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, I’ll bring some. I’m really looking forward to the event!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you so much! I hope you enjoy Thai culture.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure I will. Thanks for organizing it, Lek. See you on the event day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you! Thank you again for help. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Lek!
