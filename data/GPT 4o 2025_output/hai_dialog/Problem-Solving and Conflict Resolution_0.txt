**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Lek, I wanted to talk about our plan for Saturday. Are we still meeting at the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, hello! Um, yes, I think we meet at park. But, um, I not sure what time.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! We said 8:30 in the morning, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, 8:30. I remember now. But, um, I think you say 9:30 before?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Maybe there was a mix-up. I meant 8:30, but if 9:30 is better for you, we can do that.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, 8:30 is okay. I can come early. I just, um, confused before.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's alright, Lek. I'm glad we cleared it up. Is there anything else you want to bring?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I bring food. Um, like sandwich and fruit. You bring drink, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I'll bring some drinks. Maybe some juice and water. Does that sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, very good! I like juice. Um, what flavor you bring?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking of bringing orange juice. Is that okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Orange juice is good! I like it. Um, thank you for bring.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Lek. I'm looking forward to our day at the park.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Me too! I think it will be fun. Um, weather is nice, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the weather should be nice. Perfect for a day outside.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Good! I happy we go. Um, see you Saturday morning, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, see you Saturday morning at 8:30. Have a great day, Lek!
