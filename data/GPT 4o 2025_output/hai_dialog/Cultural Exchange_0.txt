**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I'm really interested in learning about different cultures. Can you tell me about a tradition or festival from Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! In Thailand, we have Songkran. It is, um, very famous festival. It is Thai New Year.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds exciting! When does it take place?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is in April, around 13 to 15 April. Very hot time in Thailand.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What do people usually do during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We, um, we have water fight. People throw water to each other. It is fun and, um, cool down from hot weather.

**Speaker A (NS):** A water fight sounds like a lot of fun! Is there any special meaning behind it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it is for, um, cleansing. We wash away bad luck and start new year fresh.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a beautiful tradition. Are there any other activities during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we also visit temple. We, um, pour water on Buddha statue. It is for respect and good luck.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very interesting. Do families get together during this time?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, family come together. We, um, pay respect to elder. It is important for us.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a wonderful time for family and community. Do you have any special foods during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we eat, um, traditional Thai food. Like, um, mango sticky rice. Very delicious!

**Speaker A (NS):** I love mango sticky rice! It must be a great time to enjoy it with family.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, very nice. Everyone happy and enjoy together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for sharing about Songkran. I’d love to experience it someday.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You are welcome! I hope you can come to Thailand for Songkran.

**Speaker A (NS):** I hope so too. It was great learning about your culture. Thank you!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you for listen. I happy to share.

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, and have a great day!
