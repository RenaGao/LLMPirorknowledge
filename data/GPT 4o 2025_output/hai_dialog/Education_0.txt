**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! Are you ready for the exam next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, hello! Um, I am... not ready yet. I need to study more.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay. What part do you find most difficult?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think... the writing part. It is hard for me to, um, make sentences.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Maybe we can practice together. Do you want to meet up?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is good idea. When you free?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about Saturday afternoon? We can go over some practice questions.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Saturday... um, I have class in morning. Afternoon is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let's meet at the library at 2 p.m. Is that okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, 2 p.m. is okay. I will bring my notes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. We can also review vocabulary if you want.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, vocabulary is important. I need to learn more words.

**Speaker A (NS):** Don't worry, you'll do fine. Just keep practicing.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. I will try my best.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. Do you have any other questions about the exam?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, no more question now. I think I understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, if you think of anything, just let me know.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Lek. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** See you Saturday! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Take care!
