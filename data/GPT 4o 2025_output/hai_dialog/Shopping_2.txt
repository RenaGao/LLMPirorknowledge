**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. Do you have the receipt with you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I have. Here it is. I buy this, um, how to say... blender?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, a blender. Is there something wrong with it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It not work good. It make noise, but not blend well.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. We can definitely look into that. Did you use it only once, or more?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I use two time. Both time same problem.
