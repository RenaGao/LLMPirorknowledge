**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I heard you wanted some advice on staying healthy. Is that right?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes. I want to be more healthy. Um, how to say... more energy every day.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great goal! Have you thought about starting with some exercise?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Exercise, yes. I think about it. But, um, not sure what is good for start.

**Speaker A (NS):** Walking is a good start. It's easy and you can do it anywhere. Do you like walking?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like walking. I can walk in park near my home.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Try to walk for about 30 minutes a day. It helps a lot.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I will try. And food? What food is good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Eating lots of fruits and vegetables is important. Do you eat them often?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, not so much. I eat rice and chicken more.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay. Maybe add some vegetables to your meals. It can be simple, like a salad.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Salad, yes. I can do that. And drink water, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly! Drinking plenty of water is very important. Aim for about eight glasses a day.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Eight glasses, okay. I will remember. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Lek. I'm glad to help. Do you have any other questions?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No more question now. I try these first.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Let me know how it goes. Take care!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I will. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Lek! Stay healthy!
