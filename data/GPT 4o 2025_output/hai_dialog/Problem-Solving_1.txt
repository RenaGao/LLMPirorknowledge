**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, hello. I have problem with my, uh, computer. It not work good.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what exactly is happening with your computer?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um, it is very slow. I try to open, uh, how to say... program? But it take long time.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Have you tried restarting your computer to see if that helps?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I do restart. But still slow. Maybe, um, too many thing open?

**Speaker A (NS):** That could be the issue. Sometimes having too many programs open can slow down your computer. Have you checked your task manager to see what's running?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Task manager? Um, I not sure how to do that.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Let me guide you. Press "Ctrl," "Shift," and "Esc" at the same time. Do you see a window with a list of programs?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, I see. Many thing open. I close some, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, try closing the programs you’re not using. It should help speed things up.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I close now. Um, it better! Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'm glad that helped. Is there anything else you need assistance with?
