**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! Are you ready for the test next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, hello! I am... not ready yet. I need to study more.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay. What part do you find most challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think... the grammar part is hard. Many rules, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, English grammar can be tricky. Have you tried using any study apps?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. I use app for practice. It help me with... um, sentence structure.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good idea. Do you want to study together sometime?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like that. We can study... maybe on weekend?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, Saturday works for me. We can review the grammar rules together.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, Saturday is good. I will bring my notes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We can also quiz each other. It helps to remember better.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, quiz is good. I need to practice more speaking too.

**Speaker A (NS):** We can do that. Speaking practice will help with confidence.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. I feel better now. You are very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Lek. We can do this together!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, together is better. I will see you on Saturday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. See you then, and good luck with your studying!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! See you Saturday. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Lek! Take care!
