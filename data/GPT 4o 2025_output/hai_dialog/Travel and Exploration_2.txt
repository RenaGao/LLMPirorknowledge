**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes, please. I am looking for, um, the big park... how to say... with many flowers?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you mean the Botanical Gardens?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, Botanical Gardens! How can I go there?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, it's not too far. Are you walking or taking a bus?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think I walk. Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it's a nice walk. Go straight on this street, then turn left at the second traffic light.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, straight and then left at... second light?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. After you turn, you'll see a big sign for the gardens.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I understand. Thank you very much!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Do you need any more help?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I think I am good. I will try to find it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Enjoy your visit to the gardens.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I hope it is not too hot today.

**Speaker A (NS):** The weather is nice today, so you should be fine.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, good weather. I like it.

**Speaker A (NS):** If you have any trouble, feel free to ask someone else for help.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will do that. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care!
