**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I was thinking about how different dining etiquette can be in different cultures. Have you noticed any differences between Thai and Western dining?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um, in Thailand, we use spoon and fork, not knife. We, uh, use fork to push food to spoon.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's interesting! In Western cultures, we often use a knife and fork together. Are there any other differences?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we share food. Um, how to say... we put dishes in middle, and everyone take some.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, like family-style dining. That's nice. In some Western cultures, people usually have their own plate.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, and we not start eat until, um, everyone have food. It is polite.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a lovely tradition. In some places here, people might start eating as soon as they get their food.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, and we say "enjoy your meal" before start. In Thai, we say "กินให้อร่อย" (gin hâi à-ròi).

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a nice phrase! Do you have any other customs during meals?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes, we not put chopstick in rice bowl. It is, uh, bad luck.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. That's good to know. In some Western cultures, we might not use chopsticks at all.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, and we not talk loud at table. It is, um, respect for others.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good practice. Here, people might talk more during meals, but it's important to be considerate.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, and we say thank you after meal. It is, um, show appreciation.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, saying thank you is important everywhere. It's been great learning about these differences with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I enjoy talk with you. Thank you for listen.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Lek. Let's chat again soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you next time! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Lek! Take care!
