**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! Do you have a moment to discuss our project deadlines?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I have time. Um, we talk about the project, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. We need to finalize the tasks for the upcoming deadline. Do you know when it's due?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I think it is next week... um, Friday?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right. We need to make sure everything is ready by then. How is your part of the project going?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It go well. I finish the report, but I need to check... um, the numbers again.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Double-checking the data is important. Do you need any help with that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe, yes. I not sure about some... um, calculation. Can you help me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I can help. Let's go over it together tomorrow. What time works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe morning? Like, 10 o'clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. We can meet at 10 a.m. in the conference room. Does that sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is good. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Is there anything else you need to discuss about the project?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think... um, no. I just need to finish my part and check with you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Let's make sure we stay on track for Friday.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we will finish on time. Thank you for your support.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Lek. Let's do our best. See you tomorrow at 10!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you tomorrow. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Lek! Have a good day!
