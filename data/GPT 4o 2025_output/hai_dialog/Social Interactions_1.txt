**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I heard we’re planning a birthday surprise for Nuch. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um, I think maybe we can do... how to say... a small party at park?

**Speaker A (NS):** A picnic at the park sounds lovely! Do you know which park we should go to?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think Chatuchak Park is good. It is big and, um, nice for sitting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! What about food? Should we bring some snacks?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I can bring... um, Thai food. Maybe som tam and, uh, sticky rice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! I can bring some drinks and maybe a cake. Do you think Nuch will like chocolate?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, she like chocolate very much. It is her favorite.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! What time should we meet at the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe... ten o'clock? Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten o'clock works for me. Should we tell everyone else to meet us there?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will tell them. I think they will be happy to come.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! Do you think we need any decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe just some balloons. It is easy to bring.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! I can pick up some balloons on my way. Anything else we need to plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think that is all. We just need to, uh, make sure Nuch not know.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, it’s a surprise! I’ll make sure to keep it a secret. Thanks for organizing this with me, Lek.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No problem! I am happy to help. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a great day, Lek.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, you too! Bye!
