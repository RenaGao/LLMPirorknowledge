**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes, please. I am looking for hotel... um, near here. I not sure where to go.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it is... um, "Green Tree Hotel."

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the Green Tree Hotel. It's not far from here. Do you have a map or a phone with GPS?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I have phone, but... um, battery low. Maybe you can tell me the way?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! From here, you go straight down this street for about two blocks. Then, turn right at the traffic light.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, go straight and then right at... um, traffic light?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly. After you turn right, you'll see a big supermarket on your left. The hotel is just past that, on the same side.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I see. Supermarket on left, hotel after. Thank you very much!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Do you need any more help with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I think I understand. Thank you for help. You are very kind.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's my pleasure. If you get lost, just ask someone nearby. People here are friendly.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will do that. Um, how long to walk there?

**Speaker A (NS):** It should take about 10 minutes if you walk at a normal pace.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, 10 minutes. I can do that. Thank you again!

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! Have a great stay at the hotel.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I hope you have a good day too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks! Take care and safe travels.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Bye-bye! See you!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
