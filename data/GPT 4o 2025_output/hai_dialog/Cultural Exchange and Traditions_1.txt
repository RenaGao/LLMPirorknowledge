**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! It's great to see you. Today, I thought we could talk about dining etiquette. How is it different in Thailand compared to here?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! Yes, um, in Thailand, we use spoon and fork. Not knife. Spoon is main, uh, tool.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that's interesting! So, you use the fork to push food onto the spoon?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes. Fork is for push. Spoon is for eat. And, um, we not pass food with fork. It is not polite.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Here, we often use a knife and fork together. What about chopsticks? Are they common in Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Chopsticks, um, we use for noodle. Like, uh, Chinese food. But not for rice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. In some places, chopsticks are used for almost everything. What about table manners? Are there any specific rules?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um, we not put feet on chair. It is rude. And, uh, we wait for elder to start eat first.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a nice tradition, respecting elders. Here, we often wait for everyone to be served before starting. How about tipping? Is it common in Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Tipping, um, not very common. But, uh, in big city, like Bangkok, some people do. Maybe 10 percent.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's good to know. Here, tipping is usually expected, around 15 to 20 percent. Do you have any other dining customs?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um, we say "kin khao" for eat rice, but it mean eat meal. Rice is important.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's fascinating! Rice is such a staple in many cultures. Thank you for sharing these insights.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You are welcome. I learn much about your culture too. It is good to know.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to hear that. It's always great to learn from each other. Shall we meet again to discuss more topics?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like that. We can talk more next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Looking forward to it. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
