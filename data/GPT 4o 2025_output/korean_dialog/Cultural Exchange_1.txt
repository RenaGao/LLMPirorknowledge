**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! I was thinking about our dinner plans. Have you noticed any differences in dining etiquette between here and Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes, there are many differences. Um, in Korea, we use chopsticks and spoon together. Here, mostly fork and knife, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right. We usually use a fork and knife. Is there anything else that's different?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, in Korea, we say "잘 먹겠습니다" (jal meokgetseumnida) before eating. It means, um, "I will eat well."

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that's interesting! We usually just say "Enjoy your meal" or "Bon appétit." Do you have any other customs?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we also pour drinks for each other. It is polite to, um, not pour your own drink.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Here, it's common to pour your own drink unless you're at a formal event. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes, we don't start eating until the oldest person starts. It is respect.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a nice tradition. We don't have that rule, but sometimes we wait for everyone to be served.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. And, um, in Korea, we don't tip. But here, tipping is important, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, tipping is a big part of dining out here. Usually, around 15-20% of the bill.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I understand. It is different, but I learn. Um, what about talking during meal?

**Speaker A (NS):** We often talk during meals. It's a social time. Is it the same in Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we talk too, but sometimes quiet if eating with elders. Respect again.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. It's great to learn about these differences. Thanks for sharing, Minji!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you for listening. I enjoy talking about this. Um, see you next time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Let's plan another dinner soon. Take care, Minji!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, take care! Goodbye!
