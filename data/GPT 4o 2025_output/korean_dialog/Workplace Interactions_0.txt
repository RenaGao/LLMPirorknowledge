**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji, do you have a moment to discuss the project deadlines?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, I have time. Um, what is... deadline for project?

**Speaker A (NS):** We need to finish the first draft by next Friday. Do you think that's manageable?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Next Friday... um, I think it is okay. But, maybe... some part is difficult.

**Speaker A (NS):** Which part do you find difficult? Maybe I can help.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** The, um, analysis part. I not sure how to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. We can break it down into smaller tasks. Have you gathered all the data?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I have data. But, um, how to say... organize is hard.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries. Let's meet tomorrow to organize it together. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that is good. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! What time is best for you tomorrow?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe... 10 a.m. is good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. We can meet in the conference room at 10 a.m.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I will be there. And, um, about presentation... when is it?

**Speaker A (NS):** The presentation is scheduled for the following Wednesday. We have some time to prepare.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, okay. I will practice more. I want to do well.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure you'll do great. If you need any help, just let me know.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I will ask if I need. Um, see you tomorrow!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow, Minji! Have a good day.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Goodbye!
