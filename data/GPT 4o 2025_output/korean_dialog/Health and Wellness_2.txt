**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How can I help you with your fitness goals today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello. I want to, um, get more strong. Maybe lose some weight too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any specific exercises you like or want to try?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like running, but not very fast. And, um, I want to try... how to say... lift heavy things?

**Speaker A (NS):** Lifting weights? That's a good choice for building strength.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, lifting weights. But I not know how to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! We can start with some basic exercises. Do you have access to a gym?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I have gym near my house. It is small, but have many... um, machines.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. We can focus on a mix of cardio and strength training. How often can you work out each week?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe three times a week? I am busy with work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Three times is a good start. We can create a balanced routine for you. Do you have any injuries or concerns?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No injuries, but sometimes my knee hurt after running.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, we'll include some low-impact exercises to protect your knees. How about cycling or swimming?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Cycling is good. I like it. Swimming, um, I not swim well.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's fine. Cycling will be great for your knees. Let's plan two days of weight training and one day of cycling.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sounds good. And, um, what about food? I need to eat different?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, a balanced diet is important. Focus on lean proteins, vegetables, and whole grains. Do you need help with meal planning?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, please. I not sure what is best to eat.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'll send you some simple meal ideas. We can adjust them based on your preferences.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you very much. I will try my best.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Let's check in next week to see how you're doing. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that is good. Thank you for help. See you next week!
