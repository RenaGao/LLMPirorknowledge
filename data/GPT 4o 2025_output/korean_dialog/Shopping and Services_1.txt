**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! Are you thinking about buying a new phone?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I want to buy new phone. My old one is, um, very slow now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. What features are you looking for in a new phone?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I want good camera. And also, battery... how to say... long time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Long battery life, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, long battery life. And maybe big screen for watching video.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Do you have a specific brand in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think maybe Samsung or Apple. They are popular in Korea.

**Speaker A (NS):** Both are great choices. Do you have a budget?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, not too expensive. Maybe around... 800 dollars?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, there are good options in that range. Have you checked any reviews?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I see some online. But, um, too many information. Hard to choose.

**Speaker A (NS):** It can be overwhelming. Maybe focus on the features most important to you.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think camera and battery most important. And, um, easy to use.

**Speaker A (NS):** User-friendly interface is important. Have you tried using any models in a store?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Not yet. I will go this weekend to try. Maybe it help decide.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good idea. You can see how they feel in your hand.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will do that. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Minji! Let me know which one you choose.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I will tell you. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Minji! Have a great day!
