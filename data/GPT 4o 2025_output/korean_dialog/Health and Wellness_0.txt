**Speaker A (NS):** Hello! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello. I have, um, some problem. My head... it hurt.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. How long have you been experiencing this headache?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, maybe three days? Yes, three days.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, and is the pain constant, or does it come and go?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is... um, come and go. Sometimes very strong.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Do you have any other symptoms, like nausea or dizziness?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, little dizzy. And, um, stomach... not good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright. Have you taken any medication for the headache?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I take... how to say... pain pill?

**Speaker A (NS):** Painkillers, like aspirin or ibuprofen?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, ibuprofen. But not help much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Have you been under a lot of stress lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, yes. Work is busy. Many things to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** That could be contributing. Do you get enough sleep?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sleep... not enough. Maybe five hours?

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. It's important to rest. Let's check your blood pressure and see if we can find the cause.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. I hope it is not serious.

**Speaker A (NS):** We'll do our best to help you feel better. After the check, we can discuss some options.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, thank you very much. I feel better talking to you.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. Let's get started, and we'll find a solution together.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, together. Thank you, doctor.
