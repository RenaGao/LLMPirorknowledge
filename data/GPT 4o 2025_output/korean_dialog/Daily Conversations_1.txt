**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, hello! I think... not much plan. Maybe stay home. You have idea?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about we go to the park? The weather is supposed to be nice.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, park is good! We can, um, walk and talk. Yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we can do that. Do you want to bring some snacks or drinks?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I bring... how to say... rice roll? Korean food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, kimbap! That sounds delicious. I can bring some drinks.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Great! What time we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 11 a.m. at the park entrance?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, 11 a.m. is good. Um, which park we go?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let's go to Central Park. It's not too far.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Central Park, okay. I know how to go there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Do you need directions or anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I think I can find. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, see you at 11 then!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you then! I am excited.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Have a great day until then.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, you too! Bye-bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Minji!
