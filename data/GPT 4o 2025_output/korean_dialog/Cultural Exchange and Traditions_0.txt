**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! I heard you have a special festival coming up. Can you tell me about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! We have Chuseok soon. It is, um, like Korean Thanksgiving.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, interesting! What do you usually do during Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We, uh, visit family and... how to say... pay respect to ancestors.

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean you honor your ancestors?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, honor. We do ceremony, and also eat special food.

**Speaker A (NS):** What kind of food do you eat?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We eat songpyeon. It is rice cake with, um, sweet filling inside.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Do you make it yourself?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, family make together. It is fun and, uh, important tradition.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you have any other activities during Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We also play games, like yutnori. It is, um, board game with sticks.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a lot of fun! How long does the festival last?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is three days. We have holiday from work and school.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's nice. It must be a great time to relax and enjoy with family.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, very good time. I look forward to it every year.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for sharing, Minji. I learned a lot about Chuseok!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You are welcome! I am happy to tell you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Let's catch up again soon. Have a wonderful Chuseok!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! I will. See you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you, Minji! Take care!
