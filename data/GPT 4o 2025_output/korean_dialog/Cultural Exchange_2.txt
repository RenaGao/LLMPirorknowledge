**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! I was curious, could you tell me about your favorite holiday in Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, hello! My favorite holiday is Chuseok. It is, um, like Korean Thanksgiving.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, interesting! What do you usually do during Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We, uh, visit family and, um, make special food. Like, uh, songpyeon. It is rice cake.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Do you have any special traditions or activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we do, um, ancestor... how to say... ancestor ceremony?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ancestral rites?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, ancestral rites. We show respect to ancestors. Very important.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really meaningful. Do you have any favorite memories from Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. I like when all family together. We play games, like yutnori. It is fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yutnori? What kind of game is that?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is, um, board game with sticks. We throw sticks and move pieces.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a lot of fun! Do you also exchange gifts during Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sometimes, yes. We give, um, food or, uh, health things. Like ginseng.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s thoughtful. It must be a busy time for you.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, very busy but happy. I like Chuseok very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for sharing, Minji. I learned a lot about Chuseok!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You are welcome! I am happy to tell you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s talk more about it sometime. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, let’s talk again. Have a nice day too!
