**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, please. I am looking for... um, hotel. Nearby hotel.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I think it is... "Green Park Hotel"?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Green Park Hotel! It's not too far from here. Do you have a map or a phone with GPS?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I have phone, but... um, battery is low. Can you tell me the way?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! You need to go straight down this street for about two blocks, then turn left at the traffic light.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Two blocks, then left... at, um, light?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right. After you turn left, you'll see the hotel on your right side, just past the park.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, okay. I understand. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Do you need any more help with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I think I am okay. You are very kind.

**Speaker A (NS):** Happy to help! Enjoy your stay at the hotel.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I will. Um, how to say... have a good day?

**Speaker A (NS):** You got it! Have a good day too!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care!
