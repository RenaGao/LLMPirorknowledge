**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! We were thinking about planning a group vacation. Do you have any ideas for a destination?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello! Yes, I think... um, maybe we can go to Jeju Island? It is very beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Jeju Island sounds amazing! What activities do you think we should do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We can, um, visit the beach and... how to say... climb the mountain? Hallasan?

**Speaker A (NS):** Climbing Hallasan sounds like a great adventure! Do you think everyone will enjoy hiking?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think so. But maybe some people... um, not like too much walking. We can also see... um, waterfalls?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good point. Visiting waterfalls could be a nice option for those who prefer something less strenuous. How about food? Any local dishes we should try?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes! We should try... um, black pork? It is famous in Jeju.

**Speaker A (NS):** Black pork sounds delicious! Do you know any good restaurants there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I hear there is... um, good place near the beach. I can find name later.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, that would be helpful. What about accommodation? Do you have any preferences?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe we can stay in... um, guesthouse? It is more... how to say... friendly?

**Speaker A (NS):** A guesthouse sounds cozy and a great way to meet locals. How long do you think we should stay?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think... um, three days? Enough to see many things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Three days should be perfect. Should we plan any group activities in the evenings?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, maybe we can have... um, barbecue? And talk together.

**Speaker A (NS):** A barbecue sounds like a fun way to end the day. Do you think we need to book anything in advance?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, maybe... um, the guesthouse and... um, car rental? For travel around.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. I can help with the bookings if you want.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! That is very helpful. I will find more information about... um, places to visit.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let's finalize the details soon. Thanks for your input, Minji.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you too! I am excited for the trip. See you soon!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you soon, Minji! Looking forward to it!
