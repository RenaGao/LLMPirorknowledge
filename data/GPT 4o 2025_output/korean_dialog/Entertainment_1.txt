**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! Do you have any plans for this evening?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, hello! No, I don't have plan. Maybe we can do something together?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! How about going out for dinner? Do you have a favorite restaurant?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I like... how to say... the place with spicy chicken. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean the Korean BBQ place downtown?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes! Korean BBQ. I like it very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe... seven o'clock? Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Seven works for me. Do you want to do anything after dinner?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** After dinner... maybe we can watch movie? 

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds fun! Is there a movie you want to see?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I hear new action movie is good. But, um, I forget name.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, we can check the listings when we get there. 

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that is good idea. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Should we meet at the restaurant or somewhere else?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think... meet at restaurant is easy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I'll see you at the Korean BBQ at seven then.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, see you there! I am excited.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Have a great afternoon until then.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, you too! Bye!
