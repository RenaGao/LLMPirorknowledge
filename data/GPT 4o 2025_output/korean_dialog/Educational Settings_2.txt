**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji, are you ready to discuss the topic for our study group today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, I am ready. But, um, topic is little difficult for me. 

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! Which part do you find challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** The, um, how to say... the part about economic... um, economic growth?

**Speaker A (NS):** Economic growth, right. What specifically is confusing?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is about, uh, why some country grow fast and other not. I not understand well.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. It often depends on factors like resources, technology, and policies. Do you want me to explain more about these?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, please. Resources, like... um, natural things?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, like oil, minerals, and fertile land. Countries with more resources can grow faster. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it make sense. And technology, it is like... new machine?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, new machines and innovations that improve production. Technology can boost efficiency and growth.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. And policy, it is like government rule?

**Speaker A (NS):** Correct. Government policies can encourage or hinder growth, like tax incentives or trade agreements.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. It is more clear now. I will study more about this.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! If you have more questions, feel free to ask anytime.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. Thank you for help. 

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Minji. Let's meet again to review before the next session.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, let's do that. See you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a good day!
