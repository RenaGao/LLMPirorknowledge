**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I heard you recently achieved something significant. Can you tell me about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you. I, um, finish my first marathon last week.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that's amazing! How long did you train for it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I train for, uh, six month. It was very hard, but I feel happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Six months is a long time. What was the most challenging part for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm, maybe... waking up early for run. I like sleep, so it is difficult.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! How did you feel when you crossed the finish line?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I feel very... um, proud? Yes, proud. And tired, but happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great feeling. What does completing the marathon mean to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It mean I can do hard thing if I try. It give me, um, confidence.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a wonderful takeaway. Do you plan to run another marathon?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe, yes. But first, I need rest. My legs still hurt!

**Speaker A (NS):** Rest is important. Do you have any advice for someone wanting to run a marathon?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, um, start slow. And, uh, don't give up. It is hard, but you can do it.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great advice. Thank you for sharing your experience!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you for listen. I am happy to talk about it.

**Speaker A (NS):** It was my pleasure. Let's catch up again soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I would like that. See you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you soon! Take care and rest well.
