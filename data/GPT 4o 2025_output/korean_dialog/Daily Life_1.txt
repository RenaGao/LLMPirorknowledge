**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, not yet. I think maybe... picnic with family? 

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! Where are you thinking of going?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, we want to go to... um, how to say... park near river?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, a park by the river? That sounds perfect. Do you have everything you need for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think so. We bring food, like... um, chicken and fruit. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Yum, that sounds delicious! Are you planning any activities there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, maybe play... um, games? And ride bicycle.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Do you have bikes, or will you rent them?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We rent. There is place... um, near park.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What time are you planning to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe... um, morning? Around ten o'clock.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thatâ€™s a good time. The weather should be nice then. 

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I hope so. Weather is very important for picnic.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. Do you need any help with planning?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, no, but thank you. I think I can manage.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, if you need anything, just let me know.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you very much. I will tell you if I need help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I hope you have a wonderful picnic with your family.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! I will enjoy. Have a nice weekend!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Minji! Take care and see you soon.
