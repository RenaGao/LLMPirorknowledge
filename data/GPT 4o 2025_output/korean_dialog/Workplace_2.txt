**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji, welcome to the team! Are you ready to learn about your first task?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you. I am ready. Please tell me what I do.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, your first task is to organize the files in the shared drive. Do you know how to access it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I think so. I need to use... how to say... the computer network?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly. You’ll use the company network. Do you need help with logging in?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe, yes. I try before, but it not work. Can you show me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Let me walk you through it. First, open the browser and go to the company portal.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I open browser. Then, I go to... um, portal?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right. Once you're there, use your employee ID and password to log in.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. I use ID and password. I try now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Once you're logged in, you’ll see the shared drive link. Click on it to access the files.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I click link. Now I see files. What I do next?

**Speaker A (NS):** Now, you need to organize them by date and project name. Can you do that?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I can do. I put by date and project name. Is there anything else?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s the main part. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me anytime.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I will ask if I need help. I try my best.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you’ll do great, Minji. Let me know when you’re done, and we can review it together.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will tell you. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Welcome again, and good luck with your task!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I will work hard. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Minji! See you later.
