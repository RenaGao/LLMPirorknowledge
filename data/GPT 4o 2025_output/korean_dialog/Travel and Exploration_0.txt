**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! Are you excited about our trip to New York City?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! I am very excited. I never go to New York before.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Do you have any places you really want to visit?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I want to see... how to say... big park? Central Park!

**Speaker A (NS):** Central Park is beautiful. We can have a picnic there. What else do you want to do?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I want to see... um, tall building. Ah, Empire State Building!

**Speaker A (NS):** The Empire State Building is amazing. We can go to the top and see the whole city. Do you like museums?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like museum. Maybe... um, art museum?

**Speaker A (NS):** The Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of the best. We should definitely go there. How about food? Any special dishes you want to try?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I want to try... um, New York pizza. I hear it is very good.

**Speaker A (NS):** New York pizza is delicious! We can find a good pizza place. Do you have any questions about the trip?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. How we go around city? Subway?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the subway is the easiest way to get around. I can help you with the map. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I think that is all. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm glad to help. Let's make sure we have everything planned before we go.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, let's plan well. I am looking forward to trip.
