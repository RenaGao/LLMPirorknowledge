**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji, do you have a moment to discuss the project deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, I have time. Um, the deadline is... how to say... soon?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it's coming up next Friday. Are you on track to finish by then?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think... maybe. I work hard, but some part is difficult.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Which part are you finding challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** The, um, report part. I not sure about... um, the format?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the report format. I can help with that. Do you have a draft ready?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I have draft. But it is not... um, complete.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries. Let's review it together. Can you send it to me by tomorrow?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I send it tomorrow. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. Once we finalize the report, do you think you'll meet the deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think so. After report, other things are... um, easier.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's good to hear. If you need more help, just let me know.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. Thank you for understanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. Let's aim to have everything ready by next Friday.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will do my best. Um, thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're doing great, Minji. Keep up the good work!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I will work hard. See you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, Minji. Have a good day!
