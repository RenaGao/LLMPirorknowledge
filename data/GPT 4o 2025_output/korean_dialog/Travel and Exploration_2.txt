**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, please. I am looking for... um, big park. It is famous here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean Central Park? It's quite popular.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, Central Park! How can I go there?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, it's not too far. Are you walking or taking public transport?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I think I walk. Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it's a nice walk. Just go straight down this street for about ten minutes, then turn left at the big intersection.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, straight and then left. Um, is there... how to say... sign?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, there are signs. Look for the one that says "Central Park Entrance."

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. Thank you. And, um, what can I do in park?

**Speaker A (NS):** There are lots of things! You can walk, have a picnic, or even rent a bike.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Rent a bike? That sounds fun. Where I can rent?

**Speaker A (NS):** There's a bike rental shop near the main entrance. You can't miss it.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you so much. I will try bike. Um, how long to walk there?

**Speaker A (NS):** It should take about fifteen minutes from here.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Fifteen minutes. Okay, I understand. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Enjoy your time at the park.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day!
