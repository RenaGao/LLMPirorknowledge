**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I heard you like cooking. Can you tell me about your favorite meal and how you prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, I like cooking. My favorite is... um, kimchi jjigae. It is Korean stew with kimchi.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! How do you make it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** First, I need kimchi, pork, and tofu. Um, also onion and garlic. I cut them... small pieces.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so you chop everything up. What do you do next?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, chop. Then, I put pork in pot and... um, fry? Fry with garlic and onion.

**Speaker A (NS):** You sauté the pork with garlic and onion. Got it. What comes after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** After, I add kimchi and water. Boil it... um, for long time. Maybe 20 minutes.

**Speaker A (NS):** So you let it simmer for about 20 minutes. Do you add the tofu then?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, tofu go in last. And also, I put... um, how to say... red pepper paste?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, gochujang! That adds a nice flavor, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, gochujang. It make spicy. I like spicy food.
