**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I'm really curious about Korean culture. Can you tell me about a tradition or festival from your country?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. In Korea, we have Chuseok. It is, um, like Thanksgiving in America.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, interesting! What do people usually do during Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We, uh, visit family and... um, how to say... we give thanks to ancestors.

**Speaker A (NS):** So, it's a time for family gatherings and honoring ancestors?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes. We also eat special food, like songpyeon. It is rice cake.

**Speaker A (NS):** Songpyeon sounds delicious! Is there anything else special about Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We have, um, traditional games. And, uh, we wear hanbok, the traditional clothes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! Do you have a favorite part of Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like, um, making songpyeon with family. It is... how to say... very happy time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Making food together must be a great bonding experience. How long does Chuseok last?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is three days. Many people travel, so, um, roads are busy.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. It must be a very important holiday for everyone.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, very important. We, uh, also visit graves of ancestors.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a meaningful tradition. Thank you for sharing about Chuseok with me.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You are welcome. I am happy to tell you.

**Speaker A (NS):** I learned a lot today. Thank you again!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, too. I hope you can, um, visit Korea one day.

**Speaker A (NS):** I would love that! Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, you too! Goodbye!
