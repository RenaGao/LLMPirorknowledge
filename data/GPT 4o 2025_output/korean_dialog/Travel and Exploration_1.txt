**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can you tell me about your favorite place to visit and why it’s special to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. My favorite place is, um, Han River in Seoul. It is very... how to say... peaceful?

**Speaker A (NS):** Peaceful, that sounds nice. What do you like to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like to, um, ride bicycle and eat chicken with friends. The weather is very good, so it is fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great way to spend time. Is there anything else you enjoy about the Han River?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, there are many... um, festivals? And music. It is very exciting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Festivals and music make it lively! Do you go there often?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I go... maybe once a month? It is good for relax.

**Speaker A (NS):** Once a month is a nice routine. Do you have a favorite memory from there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. Last year, I see fireworks with family. It was very beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Fireworks are always amazing. It must have been a memorable experience.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, very special. I want to go again soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** I hope you get to visit again soon. It sounds like a wonderful place.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I hope you can visit too someday.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to! Thank you for sharing about the Han River.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You are welcome. Thank you for listening.

**Speaker A (NS):** It was my pleasure. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, you too. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care.
