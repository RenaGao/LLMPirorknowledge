**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for joining me today. Can you tell me about your favorite hobby?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, hello. My favorite hobby is, um, playing guitar. I like it very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! How long have you been playing the guitar?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I play guitar for, um, maybe five years? Yes, five years.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that's quite a while! What do you enjoy most about playing the guitar?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I enjoy... how to say... making music. It is very... um, relaxing for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Music can be very soothing. Do you play any particular style or genre?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like, um, rock music. But sometimes I play... uh, slow songs too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Rock music is great! Do you have a favorite rock band or musician?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like... um, The Beatles. They are very famous, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, The Beatles are legendary! Have you ever performed in front of others?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, I play in, um, small concert with friends. It was... how to say... exciting?

**Speaker A (NS):** That must have been exciting indeed! Do you plan to perform again?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I want to play more. Maybe next month, we have another concert.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great plan. I hope it goes well! Is there anything else you like about playing guitar?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I like learning new songs. It is... um, challenge but fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Learning new songs can be challenging but rewarding. Do you teach yourself, or do you take lessons?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I learn by myself. I watch, um, videos online. Very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great way to learn! Well, it was nice talking to you about your hobby.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. I enjoy talking with you.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Have a great day, and good luck with your next concert!
