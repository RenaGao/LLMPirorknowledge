**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji, I heard you were upset with me. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, hello. Um, I think maybe... misunderstanding? 

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Can you tell me what happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, um, last weekend, you not come to meeting. I wait long time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, I’m really sorry about that. I thought we agreed to meet on Sunday, not Saturday.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. I think it was Saturday. Maybe I make mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s okay, these things happen. How about we plan another time to meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, good idea. Um, when you free?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this Saturday at 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Saturday, 2 p.m. is good. We meet at same place?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the same café. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it work. Thank you for understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I’m glad we cleared it up.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Me too. I feel better now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll see you on Saturday then.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you Saturday. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Minji. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Bye!
