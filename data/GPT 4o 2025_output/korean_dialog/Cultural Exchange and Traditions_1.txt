**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I heard you wanted to learn about dining etiquette in different cultures. Is that right?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes. I am very interested. In Korea, we have many... um, how to say... rules for eating.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that's fascinating! Can you tell me some of those rules?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sure. We, um, wait for the oldest person to start eating. It is very important.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a nice tradition. In some Western cultures, we usually start eating when everyone has their food.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. In Korea, we also use chopsticks and spoon. Spoon for rice and soup.

**Speaker A (NS):** Interesting! In Western cultures, we mostly use forks and knives. Do you find it difficult to use them?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, a little. I practice, but sometimes I drop... uh, food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay! It takes time to get used to different utensils. Do you have any other dining customs?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we do not... um, leave food on plate. It is not polite.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. In some places, leaving a little food can show you’re full. It's interesting how customs vary.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, very different. Also, we say "잘 먹겠습니다" before eating. It means, um, "I will eat well."

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a lovely phrase. We often say "Bon appétit" or "Enjoy your meal" before starting.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I like that. It is nice to wish good meal.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. Do you have any questions about Western dining etiquette?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. Is it okay to talk during meal?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it's common to have conversations during meals. It makes the meal more enjoyable.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I see. In Korea, we talk too, but not too loud.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good point. Being considerate of others is important everywhere.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I agree. Thank you for sharing. I learn a lot today.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! It was great talking with you. Have a wonderful day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. You too! Goodbye!
