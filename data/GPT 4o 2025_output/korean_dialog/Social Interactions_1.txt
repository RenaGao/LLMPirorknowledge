**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! We were thinking about planning a birthday surprise for Jisoo. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, hello! Yes, um, I think maybe we can do... how to say... picnic?

**Speaker A (NS):** A picnic sounds lovely! Do you know where we could have it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, maybe at... um, Han River Park? It is very nice place.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea! What should we bring for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We can bring... uh, food like... chicken? And maybe some... um, drinks?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I can bring some drinks. Do you think Jisoo will like it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think she will like very much. She love outdoor.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! How about decorations? Should we have some?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Maybe some balloons? And, um, banner with "Happy Birthday"?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds festive! What time should we meet to set everything up?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe... 10 a.m.? Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** 10 a.m. works for me. How about the others in the group?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I will ask them. I think they will be okay.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you need help with anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe help with... how to say... carrying things?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I can help carry things. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I think that is all. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm excited for the surprise. Let's make it special for Jisoo.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it will be very special. Thank you again!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Minji. See you on the day of the picnic!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you then! Goodbye!
