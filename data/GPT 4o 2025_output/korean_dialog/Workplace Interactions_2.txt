**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji, thanks for joining the call. Are you ready to plan our team meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, hello! I am ready. We need to talk about, um, the agenda, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Do you have any topics you think we should include?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I think we should discuss the new project timeline. It is important, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great point. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe we talk about, uh, team roles? Who do what in project.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. Clarifying roles will help everyone. How about discussing any challenges we might face?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, challenges. Maybe, um, we can talk about budget problem too?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, we can add budget issues to the agenda. Do you think we need to set a time for each topic?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, time is good. Maybe, uh, 15 minutes for each?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds reasonable. How long should the meeting be in total?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe one hour? Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** One hour works well. When should we schedule the meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** How about, um, Friday morning? Is it good for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Friday morning is perfect. Let's say 10 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, 10 a.m. is good. I will, um, send email to team.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thank you for doing that. Is there anything else we need to cover?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I think we have all. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Minji. Thanks for your input. Let's make this meeting productive.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, let's do it. See you on Friday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a great day!
