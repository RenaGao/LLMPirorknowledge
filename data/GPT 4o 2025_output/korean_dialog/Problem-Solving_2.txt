**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji, I noticed there was a small mistake in the report you submitted yesterday. Could we talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes, um, I am sorry. What mistake is there?

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! It’s just a minor error in the data section. Some numbers don’t match the source. Do you remember which part you used?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. I think I use, um, wrong file. I will check again.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. Do you need any help finding the correct file?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, but I think I can find it. I will fix and send to you soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Just let me know if you need any assistance. When do you think you can have it ready?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe by tomorrow morning? Is that okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that works perfectly. Thank you for handling it so quickly.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No problem. I am sorry again for mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s alright, Minji. Mistakes happen. I appreciate your quick response.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you for understanding. I will be more careful next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure you will. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, no, I think that is all. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! If anything comes up, feel free to reach out.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. Thank you. Have a good day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Minji. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you soon! Goodbye!
