**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! Are you ready for the big test next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello! Um, I am little nervous. The test is very... how to say... important?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it is important. Do you have a study plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I try to study every day. But, sometimes, I not understand all... um, material.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Maybe we can study together? I can help with any questions you have.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, that is very kind! Yes, I like that. We can meet in library?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, the library is a great place. What time works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe... after class? Around 3 p.m.?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! We can review the chapters and do some practice questions.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, practice questions are good. I need more practice with... um, problem solving.

**Speaker A (NS):** We can focus on that. Do you have any specific topics you find difficult?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, yes. The... how to say... equations? They are hard for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Equations can be tricky. We can go through them step by step.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I think it will help me a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. We’ll make sure you feel confident for the test.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I hope so. I want to do well.

**Speaker A (NS):** You will! Just keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to ask questions.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will ask. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Minji. Let’s meet at the library at 3 p.m. then.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, see you then!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you! Have a great day until then.
