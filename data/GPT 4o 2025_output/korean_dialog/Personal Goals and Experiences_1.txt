**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for joining me today. Can you tell me about a skill you want to learn and why it's important to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you. I want to learn... um, how to play guitar. It is very... um, interesting for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Why do you find playing the guitar interesting?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like music very much. Guitar is... um, how to say... it is good for express feeling.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Music is a great way to express emotions. Have you tried playing any instruments before?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I play piano when I was young. But, um, not very good now.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay! It's great that you have some musical background. Do you have a specific type of music you want to play on the guitar?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I like... how to say... soft music? Like ballad.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ballads are beautiful. They can be very soothing. Do you have a favorite ballad artist?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like... um, Eric Clapton. His music is very... um, touching.

**Speaker A (NS):** Eric Clapton is a fantastic choice! His guitar skills are amazing. How do you plan to start learning the guitar?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think... um, take class. Maybe online class is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Online classes can be very convenient. Have you found any classes yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Not yet, but I look for... um, good teacher. Maybe next week.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. I'm sure you'll find a great teacher soon. Is there anything else you want to share about learning the guitar?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I hope to play for my family. It is... um, special for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a wonderful goal. I'm sure your family will love it. Thank you for sharing your plans with me.
