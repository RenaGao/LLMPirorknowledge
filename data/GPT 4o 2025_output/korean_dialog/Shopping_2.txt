**Speaker A (NS):** Hello! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello. I have question about, um, return... return policy?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. What would you like to know?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I buy, um, jacket last week. But it is, uh, too small. Can I return it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, you can return it. Do you have the receipt with you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I have. Here it is. Um, is there time limit for return?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, you can return items within 30 days of purchase. You're still within that period.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, good. And, um, I need to bring anything else?

**Speaker A (NS):** Just the jacket and the receipt should be fine. Is there anything else you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, yes. If I want, um, exchange for bigger size, is it possible?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, you can exchange it for a different size. Just let us know which size you need.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, thank you. And, um, if I cannot find size, can I get refund?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, if we don't have your size, we can process a refund for you.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. Thank you for help. It is very kind.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm glad I could assist. Is there anything else you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, that is all. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. Goodbye!
