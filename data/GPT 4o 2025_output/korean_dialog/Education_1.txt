**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji, are you ready to discuss the topic for our study group?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, I am ready. But, um, this topic is little difficult for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! We can go through it together. What part do you find challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** The, um, how to say... the theory about... um, energy and... um, conservation?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the conservation of energy? It's a fundamental concept in physics.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, conservation of energy. I understand some, but not all. Can you explain more?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! It means energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. So, like, when we use battery, energy change to... um, light?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! The chemical energy in the battery changes to electrical energy, then to light energy.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I understand better now. But, um, why is it important?

**Speaker A (NS):** It's important because it helps us understand how energy flows and is used in systems, like engines or ecosystems.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I get it. So, it help us save energy too?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, understanding it can help us use energy more efficiently and sustainably.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I will study more about this. It is very... um, useful.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Minji. I'm glad I could help. Do you have any other questions?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I think I am okay now. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! Let's meet again if you need more help.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, let's do that. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Minji! Have a great day!
