**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I heard you're planning a cultural event. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I want to, um, share Korean culture. We have, uh, traditional food and games.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! What kind of traditional food are you thinking of?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We will have kimchi, and, um, maybe bulgogi. It is, uh, very popular in Korea.

**Speaker A (NS):** Delicious choices! How about the games? What will you include?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We play, um, yutnori. It is, uh, board game with sticks. Very fun!

**Speaker A (NS):** Yutnori sounds interesting! How do you play it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You throw sticks, and, um, move pieces on board. Like, uh, race.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it! Will there be any performances or music?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we have, um, traditional dance. And, uh, maybe K-pop music too.

**Speaker A (NS):** A mix of traditional and modern sounds great! How can people join the event?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** They can, um, sign up online. We have, uh, website for it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Do you need any help with organizing?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. Maybe help with, uh, setting up place and, uh, decorations.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'd be happy to help with that. When is the event happening?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is, um, next month. On, uh, Saturday. I think, um, 15th.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, I'll mark my calendar. Is there anything else you need?
