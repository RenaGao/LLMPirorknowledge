**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you looking to buy something today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I want to buy, um, how to say... a bag. 

**Speaker A (NS):** A bag? Great! Do you have a specific type in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like the leather one. But, um, price is... high?

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Have you tried asking for a discount?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Discount? Ah, yes. How to ask... politely?

**Speaker A (NS):** You can say, "Could you give me a better price?" or "Is there any discount available?"

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, thank you. I try. Um, can you give me better price?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good! How much are they asking for it now?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** They say, um, 50 dollars. Is it... good price?

**Speaker A (NS):** It depends on the quality. Did you check if it's real leather?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I check. It is real. But, um, I think maybe 40 dollars is better?

**Speaker A (NS):** You could try offering 40 dollars and see if they accept it.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, okay. I will say, "Can I pay 40 dollars?"

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And if they say no, you can ask if they can meet you halfway at 45 dollars.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Meet halfway... 45 dollars. I understand. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all! Let me know how it goes.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will try now. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Good luck with your purchase.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I hope I get good price. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day at the market!
