**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, let's go through it together. Which problem are you working on?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It is number three. The one with, um, fractions.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, fractions can be tricky. First, you need to find a common denominator. Do you remember how to do that?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, common... denominator? I think, but not sure. Can you explain again?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! You need to find a number that both denominators can divide into evenly. Then, adjust the numerators accordingly.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, I see. So, I make both same, then solve?
