**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes, please. I am looking for, um, a place to stay... a hotel.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. Do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, no, I not know name. Just need hotel close to here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, there’s a nice hotel just a few blocks away. Do you see the big red building over there?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I see it. It is, um, near to that?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. You just walk past that building, and the hotel is on the next street. It’s called the Greenfield Hotel.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Greenfield Hotel. Okay, I understand. Thank you. How long it take to walk there?

**Speaker A (NS):** It should take about ten minutes. Do you need any help with your bags?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, thank you. I can manage. Um, is there... how to say... a restaurant in hotel?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, they have a restaurant inside. It’s quite good, actually.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That is good. I will try it. And, um, what time is check-in?

**Speaker A (NS):** Check-in is usually around 3 PM, but you can ask if they have early check-in available.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will ask. Thank you for help. You are very kind.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your stay at the hotel.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I hope so. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day!
