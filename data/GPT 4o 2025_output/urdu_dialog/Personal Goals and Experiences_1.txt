**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for joining me today. Can you tell me about a skill you want to learn and why it’s important to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello, yes, thank you. I want to learn, um, how to cook. It is very important for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Cooking is a great skill! Why do you find it important?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, because I live alone now. I need to make food myself. Also, it is, um, healthy to cook at home.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, cooking at home can be much healthier. Do you have any specific dishes you want to learn?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I want to learn, um, how to make biryani. It is my favorite dish.

**Speaker A (NS):** Biryani is delicious! Have you tried cooking it before?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I try one time, but it was, um, not good. Rice was too soft.

**Speaker A (NS):** That happens sometimes. It takes practice. Do you follow any recipes?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I follow recipe from, um, internet. But sometimes, I not understand all words.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Maybe you can start with simpler recipes and work your way up. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is good idea. I will try simple first, then biryani.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great plan! Cooking can be fun once you get the hang of it. Do you have any other skills you’re interested in?
