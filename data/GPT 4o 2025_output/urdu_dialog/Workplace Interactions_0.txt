**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal, do you have a moment to discuss our project deadlines?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, of course. Um, I was thinking about this... how to say... timeline?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the timeline. We need to finalize the tasks for this week. Have you started on the report?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, report. I start it, but not finish. I need more... um, data from last meeting.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you need help finding that data?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, please. It will be very helpful. I think it is in, um, shared folder?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it should be there. I can send you the link again if you need it.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. That will make it easy. I will check and finish report soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. And how about the presentation slides? Are you working on those too?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I make slides. But, um, I need to add more... how to say... examples?

**Speaker A (NS):** More examples, right. I can help you with that. We can brainstorm some ideas together.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That is good idea. I think it will make presentation better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Let's aim to have everything ready by Friday. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, Friday is good. I will work hard to finish.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I will do that. Um, anything else we need to do?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think that's all for now. Let's meet again on Thursday to review everything.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, Thursday meeting is good. I will prepare.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, Bilal. Thanks for your time. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. Goodbye!
