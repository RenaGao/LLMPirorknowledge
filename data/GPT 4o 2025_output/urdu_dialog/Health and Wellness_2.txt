**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for coming in today. Can you tell me a bit about your current exercise routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes, thank you. I do, uh, walking in park. And sometimes, I do yoga at home.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good! How often do you walk and do yoga each week?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I walk, um, three times in week. Yoga, maybe two times. But, uh, not always same.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you have any specific fitness goals you’re working towards?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I want to, um, lose weight. And also, get more strong. How to say... build muscle?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, building muscle. That’s a great goal. Have you thought about adding any strength training to your routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Strength training... um, like lifting weights?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Lifting weights or using resistance bands can help with muscle building.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, I see. I never try before. Is it, um, difficult?

**Speaker A (NS):** It can be challenging at first, but starting with light weights and proper guidance makes it easier. I can help you with that.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That would be good. I need, um, how to say... advice? Yes, advice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! We can start with a simple plan and gradually increase the intensity. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that sound good. I want to try.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We’ll focus on a balanced routine with both cardio and strength exercises. Do you have any questions?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, no question now. But maybe later, I ask.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfectly fine. Feel free to ask anytime. Let’s meet again next week to see how you’re doing.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, next week is good. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I’m glad to assist. Have a great day, and see you next week!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, see you next week. Goodbye!
