**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes, please. I am new here. I want to go to, um, the big park... uh, with the... fountain?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you mean Central Park with the big fountain in the middle?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, Central Park! How I can go there?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, it's not too far. You can walk straight down this street for about ten minutes.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, straight... um, this street? And then?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, this street. Then you'll see a large bookstore on your right. Turn right there.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Turn right at... bookstore. I understand. And after that?

**Speaker A (NS):** After you turn, just keep going straight until you see the park entrance. It's very visible.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, okay. I go straight, then right, then straight again. Thank you. 

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Do you need any more help with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think I am okay. Um, thank you very much for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all! Enjoy your time at the park.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will. It is very nice to meet you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you too! If you need anything else, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I will remember. Have a good day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Take care and have fun exploring the town.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Safe travels!
