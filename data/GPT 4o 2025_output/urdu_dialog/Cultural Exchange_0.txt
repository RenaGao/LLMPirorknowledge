**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I'm curious to learn about different cultures. Can you tell me about a tradition or festival from your country?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, of course. In Pakistan, we have, um, festival called Eid. It is very important for us.

**Speaker A (NS):** Eid sounds interesting! Can you tell me more about what happens during Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, Eid is after Ramadan. We, uh, fast for one month, and then we celebrate. We wear new clothes and, um, give gifts.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! Is there a special meal or food you eat during Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we eat, um, sweet dish called... um, how to say... "Sewaiyan"? It is like noodles but sweet.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, sweet noodles! That sounds delicious. Do you spend time with family during Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, family is very important. We visit, um, relatives and friends. We say "Eid Mubarak" to each other.

**Speaker A (NS):** "Eid Mubarak" must mean something like "Happy Eid," right?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes, it is like "Happy Eid." We also, um, give money to children. It is called "Eidi."

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a nice tradition! Do you have any special activities or events during Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, we go to mosque for prayer in morning. After that, we, um, have big meal with family.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a wonderful time to connect with loved ones. How long does the celebration last?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Eid is, um, three days. But first day is most important.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for sharing about Eid. It sounds like a beautiful celebration. Is there anything else you'd like to add?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, no, I think that is all. Thank you for listening.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I really enjoyed learning about Eid. It was great talking to you.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, thank you. It was nice to talk. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day!
