**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal, I heard you were upset about something I said yesterday. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, hello. I was, um, little confused. You say something about my project, and I think maybe you not like it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’m sorry if it came across that way. I actually think your project is great. I just had some suggestions to make it even better.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, I see. I think maybe I not understand your words. Can you, um, explain again?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! I was suggesting that you could add more features to your app, like a reminder function. It’s just an idea to help users.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, reminder function. Yes, that is good idea. I think I can do that. Thank you for telling.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I really admire your work, and I’m here to help if you need it.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, I appreciate. Sometimes, um, English is hard for me to understand fully.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand, and you’re doing great. If you ever need clarification, just ask me.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will. I want to improve my English also, so I try to ask more.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good approach. Practice makes perfect, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, practice is good. I will do more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, are we good now? No more misunderstandings?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we are good. Thank you for talking with me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Bilal. I’m glad we cleared things up.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Me too. I feel better now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful. Let’s keep communicating openly like this.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I agree. It is important.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I’ll see you later then. Take care!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, see you later. Goodbye!
