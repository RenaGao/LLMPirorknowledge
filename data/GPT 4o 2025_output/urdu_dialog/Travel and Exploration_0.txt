**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you excited about planning our trip to the new city?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, very excited! Um, I think it will be fun with all friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Do you have any ideas about where we should go first?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, I hear there is big... um, how to say... park? Yes, big park.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean the central park? That sounds like a great start!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, central park. We can walk and see... um, nature and trees.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! What about food? Do you have any preferences?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like spicy food. Maybe we find... um, Indian restaurant?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I know a good Indian place there. We can have lunch after the park.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That is good plan. And, um, what about... night time?

**Speaker A (NS):** We could check out a local music event or maybe a night market. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, music event is nice. I like music very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll look up some events happening that night. Anything else you want to do?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe visit... how to say... museum? Yes, museum.

**Speaker A (NS):** A museum visit sounds perfect. We can learn about the city’s history.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, history is interesting. I like to know about new places.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! I’ll make a list of all these activities. We’ll have a great time.
