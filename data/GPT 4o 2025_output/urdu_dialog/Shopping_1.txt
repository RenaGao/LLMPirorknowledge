**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you looking to buy something special today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, I want to buy... how to say... a carpet for my home.

**Speaker A (NS):** A carpet, great choice! Do you have a specific style or color in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like, uh, traditional design. Maybe with red and gold color.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds beautiful. Have you seen any that you like here?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I see one. But, um, price is... how to say... too much high?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, it's too expensive. Have you tried negotiating the price with the seller?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, no, I not sure how to do. Can you help me, please?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! You can start by asking if they can offer a discount. Maybe say, "Can you give me a better price?"

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I try. Can you give me better price, please?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And if they say no, you can mention that you really like it but have a budget.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I say, "I like it, but my budget is... um, less."

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And if they still don't lower the price, you can ask if they have any similar items for less.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, I ask for similar. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! How did it go with the seller?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** He say, um, he can give little discount. I think it is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Sometimes a small discount can make a big difference.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I happy with it. Thank you for your advice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! I'm glad I could help. Enjoy your new carpet.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I will. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day at the market.
