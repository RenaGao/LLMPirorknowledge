**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It's great to meet you. I’m curious, how is dining etiquette different in your culture?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Yes, um, in my culture, we eat with hands sometimes. It is, uh, normal for us.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s interesting! Do you use any specific hand for eating?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we use right hand. Left hand is, um, not for eating. It is, uh, how to say... not polite?

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. In some cultures, using utensils is very important. How about in your culture?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We use spoon and fork, but sometimes, um, hands are better for some food. Like, uh, bread and curry.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Are there any special rules for when you start eating?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we say, um, "Bismillah" before start. It is like, uh, blessing the food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice tradition. What about after the meal? Is there anything specific you do?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** After eating, we say "Alhamdulillah." It is, um, thankfulness for food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful. In some places, it’s common to leave a little food on the plate. Is it the same for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, we try to finish all food. It is, um, respect for food and, uh, not waste.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good practice. How do you feel about dining in other cultures?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think it is, um, interesting. I like to learn new ways, but sometimes, um, it is difficult to remember all rules.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It can be challenging. Do you have any favorite international dishes?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I like pizza. It is, um, very tasty and easy to eat.

**Speaker A (NS):** Pizza is a favorite for many! Do you have any tips for someone visiting your country?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, be open to try food with hands. And, uh, enjoy the spices!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great advice! Thank you for sharing. It’s been a pleasure learning about your dining customs.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! I enjoy talking with you. It is, um, good to share culture.
