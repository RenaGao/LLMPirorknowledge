**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It's been a while since we last spoke. How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Yes, long time. I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks for asking. So, what have you been up to lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I am busy with work and family. You know, many things to do. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I've been busy too, mostly with work. Have you had any time for hobbies or anything fun?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, not much time. But I like to read books. I read, um, Urdu poetry. It is very nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! Urdu poetry is beautiful. Do you have a favorite poet?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I like... how to say... Ghalib. His words are very deep.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ghalib is a great choice! His poetry is indeed profound. Have you been able to visit any poetry readings or events?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, not yet. But I want to go. Maybe soon, when I have more time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. Let me know if you need any recommendations for events.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, thank you. I will ask you. And you, any new hobbies?

**Speaker A (NS):** I've started gardening recently. It's quite relaxing. Do you have any plants at home?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes. I have some plants. They are, um, small but nice. I like to see them grow.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Watching plants grow can be very rewarding. Do you have a favorite type of plant?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like, um, roses. They are beautiful and smell good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Roses are lovely. Maybe you can try growing some in your garden.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will try. Thank you for idea.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! It was nice catching up with you. Let's not wait so long to talk again.
