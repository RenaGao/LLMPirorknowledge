**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you ready for the test next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, hello! I am... not so ready. The test is, uh, difficult for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Which part do you find most challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** The, um, writing part. I have problem with... how to say... making sentences correct.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, sentence structure can be tricky. Have you tried practicing with sample essays?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I try. But sometimes, I not know if it is right or wrong.

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe you could ask a friend to review your essays? It helps to get feedback.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, good idea. I will ask my friend. And, um, do you have tips for... remembering vocabulary?

**Speaker A (NS):** Flashcards are great for that. You can also use apps to test yourself regularly.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes, I use app. It is helpful. But sometimes, I forget words in speaking.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s normal. Try to use new words in sentences daily. It helps with memory.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I will try this. Thank you. And, um, how you study for test?

**Speaker A (NS):** I usually make a study schedule and stick to it. It keeps me organized.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Schedule is good. I need to make one. I always, um, study last minute.

**Speaker A (NS):** Planning ahead can reduce stress. Do you want to study together sometime?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that would be nice. We can, um, help each other.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s meet this weekend at the library.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, library is good. I will bring my notes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. We’ll go over everything. Don’t worry, you’ll do well.
