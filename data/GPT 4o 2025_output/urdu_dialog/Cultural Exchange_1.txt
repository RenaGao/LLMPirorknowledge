**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal! It's great to see you. I was thinking, have you ever noticed how dining etiquette can be so different in various cultures?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Yes, I notice this. In Pakistan, we eat with hand sometimes, um, like for rice and curry. It is very normal.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's interesting! In many Western cultures, people usually use forks and knives. Do you find it difficult to switch between the two?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sometimes, yes. I, um, forget which fork to use first. But I learn slowly. In Pakistan, we also, um, share food from big plate.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sharing food sounds like a lovely tradition. It must make meals feel more communal. Do you have any favorite dishes you like to share?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, biryani is favorite. It is rice with, um, spices and meat. Very tasty! Do you have favorite food to share?

**Speaker A (NS):** I love sharing pizza with friends. It's easy and everyone can have their favorite toppings. Have you tried pizza?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I try pizza. It is good, but sometimes too much cheese for me. In Pakistan, we like spicy food more.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can understand that. Spicy food is delicious! Do you find it challenging to find spicy food here?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, sometimes. I cook at home to make it spicy. Um, I use chili powder and other spices.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great solution! Cooking at home gives you control over the flavors. Do you enjoy cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I like cooking. It is relaxing. I learn from my mother. She is very good cook.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's wonderful. Cooking is such a valuable skill. Do you ever cook for your friends here?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I cook sometimes. They like my food. I make, um, chicken karahi last week.

**Speaker A (NS):** Chicken karahi sounds delicious! I'm sure your friends loved it. It's great to share your culture through food.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is nice. Food is good way to, um, connect with people. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. It's amazing how food can bring people together. Thank you for sharing your experiences, Bilal.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you for listening. I enjoy talking about this. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Let's catch up again soon. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we meet again. Have a good day!
