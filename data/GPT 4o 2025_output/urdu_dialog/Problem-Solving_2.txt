**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! I am good, thank you. Um, I want to talk about... mistake I make.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. What happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I, uh, send wrong email to client. It was, um, not for them.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Mistakes happen. Did you let the client know about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I send another email. I say sorry and explain mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good step. Did you offer any solution to fix it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I tell them I will send correct email soon. And, um, I ask if they need more help.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How did they respond?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** They say it is okay. They understand. But I feel, um, still bad.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s normal to feel that way, but you handled it well. Is there anything else you can do to make sure it doesn’t happen again?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think I will check email more careful before send. And maybe, um, ask someone to look.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. Having a second pair of eyes can really help.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I agree. Thank you for your advice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Bilal. If you need more help, just let me know.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I will. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think that is all. Thank you for listening.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. Take care, and have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too! Goodbye!
