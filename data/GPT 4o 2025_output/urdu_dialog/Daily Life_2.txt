**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I heard you love cooking. Can you tell me about your favorite meal and how you prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, I like cooking very much. My favorite is biryani. It is, um, rice with spices and chicken.

**Speaker A (NS):** Biryani sounds delicious! How do you start making it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** First, I take rice and soak... um, soak in water. Then, I cut onion and tomato.

**Speaker A (NS):** So you soak the rice and chop the vegetables. What comes next?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, then I fry onion until it is, uh, brown. After that, I add tomato and spices like, um, cumin and turmeric.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds flavorful! Do you add the chicken after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I put chicken with spices. Cook until it is, um, soft. Then, I mix with rice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you cook the rice separately or together with the chicken?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I cook rice separate, then mix with chicken. It is, uh, layered.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Layering must give it a nice texture. How long do you cook it all together?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I cook for, um, 20 minutes more. Then, it is ready to eat.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! Do you serve it with anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I serve with raita. It is yogurt with, um, cucumber and mint.

**Speaker A (NS):** Raita sounds refreshing. I’d love to try your biryani sometime!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, you are welcome to try. I will make for you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you! I’m looking forward to it. Is there anything else you’d like to add?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think that is all. Thank you for listening.

**Speaker A (NS):** My pleasure! Thanks for sharing your recipe. Let’s catch up soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we will meet again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day!
