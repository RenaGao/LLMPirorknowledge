**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I heard we're planning a birthday surprise for our friend. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, I think we can do... how to say... a small party at home?

**Speaker A (NS):** A house party sounds great! Do you have a place in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe at my house? It is, um, big enough for everyone.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very generous of you! What about decorations and food?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Decorations, I can buy. Balloons and, um, streamers. For food, maybe we order pizza?

**Speaker A (NS):** Pizza is always a hit! Do you think we should have a cake too?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, cake is must! I can, um, order from bakery. They make good chocolate cake.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! What about the time? When should we start the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think, um, evening is good. Maybe 6 PM?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Should we invite everyone by text or call?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Text is easy. I can send message to group.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Is there anything else we need to think about?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe music? I have some, uh, playlists ready.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! Music will definitely set the mood. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think this is all. We can, um, talk more if needed.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Thanks for organizing this. It’s going to be fun!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, thank you too! I am excited.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, let’s keep in touch. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, talk soon. Goodbye!
