**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal! Thanks for meeting with me. Are you ready to plan the surprise party for Ayesha?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, I am ready. I think it will be very fun. How we start?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! First, we need to decide on a location. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, maybe we can do in, uh, her favorite park? She like nature very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect! We can set up a picnic there. What about the date? When should we have it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, let me think... maybe next Saturday? She is free that day, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Next Saturday works for me too. Now, what about the guest list? Who should we invite?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we invite her close friends and family. I can make list and send to you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. And for food, should we order or make something ourselves?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think, um, we can make some food. Maybe, uh, biryani and some snacks?

**Speaker A (NS):** Biryani sounds delicious! I can help with the snacks. Do you have any ideas for decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we can use, um, colorful balloons and, uh, flowers. She like flowers a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Balloons and flowers will look beautiful. What about music? Should we have a playlist?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, a playlist is good. I can make one with her favorite songs.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! And for the surprise, how do we get her to the park without her knowing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe I tell her we go for walk? Then we surprise her there.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a clever plan! I think she'll love it. Is there anything else we need to consider?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, maybe we need, um, a cake? I can order her favorite one.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, a cake is a must! Thank you for handling that. I think we have everything covered.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think so too. Thank you for help. It will be very nice party.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Bilal. I'm excited for the party! Let's meet again to finalize everything.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we meet again soon. Thank you, and goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Bilal! Talk to you soon.
