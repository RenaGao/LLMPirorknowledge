**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you ready for the exam next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, hello! I am... how to say... little bit nervous for exam.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's understandable. Which subject are you most worried about?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think, um, mathematics is difficult for me. The numbers and... um, formulas.

**Speaker A (NS):** Math can be tricky. Have you been able to review the material?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I try to study every day. But sometimes, I not understand all things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you have any specific questions? Maybe I can help clarify.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, thank you! I have problem with... um, calculus. The... how to say... integration?

**Speaker A (NS):** Integration can be tough. Have you tried breaking it down into smaller steps?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I try. But sometimes, I forget step. It is confusing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe we can study together. I can show you some tips.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That is good idea! I will like to study with you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! How about we meet at the library tomorrow?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, library is good. What time we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 3 PM? Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, 3 PM is perfect. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I'm happy to help. We'll get through this together.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, together is better. I feel more... um, confident now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to hear that. See you tomorrow at the library!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, see you tomorrow. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care and don't worry too much.
