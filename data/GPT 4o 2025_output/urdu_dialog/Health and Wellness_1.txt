**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal! How have you been lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! I am good, thank you. But, um, I want to talk about... staying healthy. You know, like exercise and food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Staying healthy is important. Do you have any specific questions or areas you want advice on?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think... um, how to say... I want to know good exercise for, uh, body and mind.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great question! For the body, regular exercise like walking, jogging, or yoga can be very beneficial. For the mind, meditation or even reading can help. Do you do any of these?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I do walking sometimes, but not yoga. Meditation, um, I try but not easy for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Meditation can be challenging at first. Maybe start with just a few minutes a day and gradually increase. Have you tried any apps for guidance?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I not try app. Maybe I should. You have, um, recommendation?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, there are many good ones like Headspace or Calm. They offer guided sessions that can be really helpful.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, I will look. And for food, what is... um, healthy eating?

**Speaker A (NS):** Healthy eating means having a balanced diet. Lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Do you cook at home?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I cook. I like, um, traditional food but sometimes not sure if healthy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Traditional foods can be healthy! Just try to use less oil and more fresh ingredients. Maybe add more vegetables to your dishes.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will try. And, um, drink water is important, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Staying hydrated is key. Aim for about eight glasses a day, but it can vary depending on your activity level.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I understand. Thank you for advice. It is very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Bilal! I'm glad I could help. If you have more questions, feel free to ask anytime.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will. Thank you again. I will try these things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Take care and stay healthy. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, talk soon. Goodbye!
