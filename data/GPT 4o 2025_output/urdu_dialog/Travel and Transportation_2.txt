**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I'm excited to talk about our vacation plans. Do you have any destinations in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Yes, um, I think about going to, uh, the mountains. Maybe, um, like... Switzerland?

**Speaker A (NS):** Switzerland sounds amazing! The Alps are beautiful. What activities are you interested in there?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like, um, hiking. And also, maybe... how to say... the thing with snow?

**Speaker A (NS):** Skiing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, skiing! I never try before, but I want to learn.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be fun! We can also explore the local culture. Have you thought about any other places?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, maybe, um, Italy? I hear it is very, uh, beautiful and good food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Italy is a great choice too! We could visit Rome or Venice. Do you have a preference?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I think Venice. The, uh, water streets are very... how to say... unique?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, Venice is unique with its canals. We could take a gondola ride. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That sound very nice! I like the idea. And, um, maybe try Italian pizza?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, trying authentic Italian pizza is a must! So, are we deciding between Switzerland and Italy?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think so. Both are good, but maybe Italy is better for, um, first time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Italy it is then! We can plan for Venice and enjoy the culture and food. Are you happy with this plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I am happy. Thank you for help with decide.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm glad we could plan this together. Let's finalize the details soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we will talk more later. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Talk to you soon. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too! Goodbye!
