**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you free this evening? I was thinking we could plan something fun.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Yes, I am free. Um, what you think we do?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about we go out for dinner? Do you have a favorite restaurant?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. I like the... um, place with spicy food. How to say... Indian restaurant?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Indian food sounds great! Do you mean the one on Main Street?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that one! They have very good... um, curry and naan.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect choice! What time should we meet there?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe, um, seven o'clock? Is that okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Seven works for me. After dinner, do you want to do something else?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, maybe we can... um, see a movie? Or, um, walk in park?

**Speaker A (NS):** A movie sounds fun! Do you have a particular one in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I hear about new action movie. It is... um, very exciting, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We can check the showtimes after dinner. Do you want me to book the tickets?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, please. That would be... um, very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. I'll take care of it. Anything else you want to do?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe after movie, we can have... how to say... dessert? Ice cream?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ice cream sounds like a perfect way to end the evening!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I agree. I like this plan very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! So, dinner at seven, then a movie, and ice cream after. Looking forward to it!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Me too! Thank you for planning. See you tonight!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! See you tonight!
