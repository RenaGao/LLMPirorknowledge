**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal, thanks for meeting with me today. We need to discuss how to handle the project deadline. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, thank you. I think we need more time, maybe. The work is, uh, very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Do you think we can prioritize some tasks to make it easier?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes. We can do important things first. Like, um, the report writing. It is, uh, big part.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. How about the data analysis? Can we split that work?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, yes. I can do, um, first half. You do second half? Is okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, that works for me. And what about the presentation? Do you feel comfortable starting it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, presentation... I can start, but maybe need help with, um, design. Not so good at it.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, I can help with the design part. We can review it together later.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. That is good. And, um, for meeting with manager, we need prepare?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we should prepare a summary of our progress. Maybe we can meet tomorrow to go over it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, tomorrow is good. We can, um, check everything.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Let's aim to finish the report by the end of this week. Does that sound doable?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think we can do. I will work hard.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. If you have any questions or need help, just let me know.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Bilal. I appreciate your effort. Let's catch up tomorrow then.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, see you tomorrow. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Bilal. Have a good day!
