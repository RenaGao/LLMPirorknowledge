**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal, I wanted to talk about our plan for the weekend. Are we still on for the movie?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, hello! Yes, I think... we go to movie, but I am little confuse about time.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! We planned for 3 PM on Saturday. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I see. I thought it was Sunday. Thank you for telling. Saturday is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you know which movie you want to watch?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like, um, action movie. Maybe the new one with... how to say... big car chase?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean the one with the car chases? That sounds exciting! I’m up for it.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that one! I am happy you like it too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Should we meet at the cinema or somewhere else?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe we meet at... um, coffee place near cinema? We can talk before movie.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. We can meet at the coffee shop at 2:30 PM then.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, 2:30 PM is good. I will be there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome. Is there anything else you want to plan for the day?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe after movie, we can eat dinner? I know place with good... um, spicy food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Dinner sounds perfect. I love spicy food! Let’s do that.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Great! I am happy we plan this. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all, Bilal. I’m looking forward to it.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Me too. I will see you on Saturday, then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, see you on Saturday! Have a great rest of your week.
