**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I don't think we've met before. I'm Sarah. What's your name?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello, Sarah. I am Bilal. Nice to meet you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you too, Bilal! Are you enjoying the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is very... um, how to say... lively? Many people here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, lively is the right word! So, what do you do, Bilal?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I am student. I study business at university.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's interesting! Which university do you attend?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I go to... um, City University. It is near my home.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I've heard good things about City University. What year are you in?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I am in third year now. One more year to finish.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Do you have any plans after you graduate?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I want to work in... um, how to say... finance? Like bank or company.

**Speaker A (NS):** Finance sounds like a solid choice. Do you have a specific role in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe... um, analyst? I like numbers and... um, solving problems.

**Speaker A (NS):** An analyst sounds perfect for you then! Have you done any internships?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, last summer I work in small bank. It was good experience.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's excellent! Internships are a great way to learn. Did you enjoy it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, very much. I learn many things, and people were nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to hear that. It's important to have a supportive environment.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is. Um, what about you, Sarah? What do you do?

**Speaker A (NS):** I work in marketing. I help companies with their advertising strategies.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, that is interesting! You must be very creative.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you, Bilal! I try to be. It was great talking to you.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, same here. Thank you for nice conversation.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Enjoy the rest of the party, Bilal.
