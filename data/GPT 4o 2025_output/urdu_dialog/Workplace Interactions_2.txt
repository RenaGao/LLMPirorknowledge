**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, everyone! Thanks for joining the meeting planning session. Can we start by deciding on the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, thank you. I think we need to talk about, uh, project deadline first.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good point. The project deadline is important. What else should we include?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe, um, discuss team roles? Who do what, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, clarifying team roles is crucial. Anything else on your mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, yes, we should also, um, talk about budget. It is, uh, important for planning.

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. So, we have the project deadline, team roles, and budget. Should we add a section for feedback?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, feedback is good. We can, um, improve things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! How about the timing? Do you think one hour is enough?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe one hour is short. We need, uh, more time for discuss.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's plan for an hour and a half then. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is better. More time is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Do you have any preferences for the meeting platform?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, Zoom is okay. I know how to use it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Zoom it is. And what day works best for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe Thursday? I am free that day.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thursday sounds good. Let's set it for 2 PM. Does that suit you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, 2 PM is fine. I will be ready.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent. So, to summarize, we'll meet on Thursday at 2 PM on Zoom, and we'll cover the project deadline, team roles, budget, and feedback.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is all. Thank you for, um, organizing.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Looking forward to our meeting. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, you too! Goodbye!
