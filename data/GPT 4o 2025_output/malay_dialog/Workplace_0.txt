**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Do you have a moment to discuss the project deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, um, I have time now. The deadline is, uh, next week, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's correct. How is the progress so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It is going well, but I have some, uh, problem with the data part. 

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Can you explain what the issue is?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, the data is not, uh, matching. I think maybe I make mistake in, uh, formula.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, Aiman. Would you like some help to review it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, please. I need to, um, check again. Maybe you can see what I miss.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. When would you like to go over it together?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** How about, um, tomorrow morning? Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Tomorrow morning works for me. Let's meet at 10 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, 10 a.m. is good. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Once we fix the data issue, do you think you'll meet the deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think, yes. After fix, I can finish other part fast.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Just let me know if you need anything else.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Aiman. Looking forward to our meeting tomorrow.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, see you tomorrow. Have a good day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Aiman. Take care!
