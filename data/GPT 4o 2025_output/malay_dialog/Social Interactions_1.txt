**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I heard we're planning a birthday surprise for Sarah. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, um, I think we can do... how to say... a small party at her house?

**Speaker A (NS):** A house party sounds fun! Do you know what kind of decorations she likes?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** She like, um, colorful things. Maybe balloons and, uh, streamers?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! We can get some colorful balloons and streamers. What about food? Any suggestions?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, food... maybe we can order pizza? Everyone like pizza, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Pizza is always a hit! Do you think we should also get a cake?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, cake is must! She love chocolate cake, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, a chocolate cake it is. Should we plan any games or activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe we can play... uh, board games? Or karaoke?

**Speaker A (NS):** Karaoke sounds like a lot of fun! Do you have a karaoke machine?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think my friend have one. I can ask him to bring.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! Let's make sure to check with him. What time should we start the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe, um, 7 p.m.? After everyone finish work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. I'll help with the decorations. Can you handle the food and cake?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I can do that. I will order pizza and cake.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great teamwork, Aiman! Let's make this a memorable birthday for Sarah.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, it will be fun! Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Looking forward to it! See you at the party.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** See you! Bye!
