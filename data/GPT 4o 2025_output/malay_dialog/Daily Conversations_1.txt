**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, hello! I think... no plan yet. Why you ask?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking of going to the new shopping mall in the city. Would you like to join me?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! I want to go. What is... um, interesting there?

**Speaker A (NS):** I heard there are many new shops and a big food court. We could explore and have lunch.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That sound good! We can eat there. After, maybe... um, watch movie?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Do you have a movie in mind that you want to see?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think... the new film, everyone talk about it. You know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, yes, I know the one. We can check the movie schedule later. How about meeting at 10 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, can! But, um, please buy ticket first, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I'll take care of the tickets. Anything else you want to do at the mall?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe... um, look for new clothes? I need... how to say... new shirt.

**Speaker A (NS):** New shirt, got it. We can definitely do some shopping. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I think that all. Thank you for invite me.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm looking forward to it. See you on Saturday at 10 a.m.!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, see you then! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Aiman! Have a great day until then!
