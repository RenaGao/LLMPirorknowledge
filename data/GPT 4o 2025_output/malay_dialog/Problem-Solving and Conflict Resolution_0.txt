**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! I heard you wanted to talk about something. Is everything okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! Yes, um, I want to talk about last weekend. I think maybe, uh, misunderstanding happen.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. What happened exactly?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** So, I say I will meet you at the mall, but I go to wrong place. I go to old mall, not new one.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I understand now. You went to the old mall instead of the new one in the city?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes. I confuse because, um, both malls sound same to me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. The names are quite similar. Did you try to call me?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I try, but my phone, uh, no battery. I cannot call you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s unfortunate. I was worried when you didn’t show up.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I am sorry. I should, um, check better next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, Aiman. It happens. Maybe next time we can meet at a café first?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, good idea! We meet at café, then go together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. So, are we good now? No more misunderstandings?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we good. Thank you for understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime! Let’s plan another outing soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure! I will, um, message you later.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds great. Take care, Aiman!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Goodbye!
