**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for coming in today. Can you tell me a bit about your current exercise routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, hello! Yes, I do some jogging... uh, three times a week. And, um, sometimes I do yoga.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good! How long do you usually jog for?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I jog... maybe 30 minutes. But sometimes, uh, I feel tired, so less.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's understandable. Do you have any specific fitness goals you're aiming for?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to... how to say... lose weight and be more strong.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great goals! We can definitely work on that. Have you tried any strength training before?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, not really. I not sure how to start with weights.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, I can help you with that. We can start with some basic exercises. Do you have any equipment at home?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I have, um, small dumbbells. And, uh, yoga mat.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! We can use those. How about we set a plan to include some strength training twice a week?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is good. I think I can do that.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! And for your jogging, maybe we can gradually increase the time as you get more comfortable.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will try. Maybe 5 minutes more each week?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly! That sounds like a solid plan. Do you have any questions about the routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, no question now. But I will ask if I not understand later.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, feel free to reach out anytime. I'm here to help. 

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you very much. I am excited to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm excited for you too. Let's meet again next week to see how you're doing.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, see you next week. Thank you again!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Take care and see you soon!
