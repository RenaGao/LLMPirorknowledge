**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, how can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, hello. I have question about the assignment. It is, uh, not clear for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What part of the assignment are you unsure about?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** The part where we need to, um, write report. I not sure what to include.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. You need to include an introduction, the main points, and a conclusion. Does that help?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, but, um, how long it should be?

**Speaker A (NS):** The report should be about 1,000 words. Is that okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, okay. And, um, do we need to use, uh, references?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, you should include at least three references from credible sources.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I see. And, uh, can we use internet sources?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, online sources are fine, as long as they are reliable. Do you need help finding some?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe later. I try first. Thank you for help.
