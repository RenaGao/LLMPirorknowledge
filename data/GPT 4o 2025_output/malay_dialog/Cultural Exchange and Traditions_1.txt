**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! It's nice to see you. I was wondering, have you ever noticed any differences in dining etiquette between cultures?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! Yes, um, I think so. In Malaysia, we use hand to eat sometimes, like nasi lemak. It is... um, more natural for us.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that's interesting! In some Western cultures, we usually use forks and knives. Do you find it difficult to switch between the two?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sometimes, yes. I need to remember... um, which hand for fork, which for knife. But I learn, slowly.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're doing great! Are there any specific dining customs in Malaysia that you think are unique?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we say "Bismillah" before eat. It is like... um, blessing the food. And we wait for elder to start first.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a lovely tradition. In some places, we also say grace before meals. How about tipping? Is it common in Malaysia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Tipping not very common. Sometimes, service charge already in bill. But if service very good, we can give extra.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. In the US, tipping is quite expected, usually around 15-20%. It can be confusing for visitors.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I hear about that. It is... um, different. I must remember when I travel.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! It's always good to know the local customs. Do you have any favorite dishes you like to share with friends from other cultures?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like to share satay. It is... um, grilled meat with peanut sauce. Many people like it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Satay sounds delicious! I’d love to try it someday. Do you enjoy trying foods from other cultures too?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I like pizza and sushi. They are... um, very tasty. I try to cook sometimes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Cooking is a wonderful way to explore different cultures. Do you have any tips for someone visiting Malaysia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, try local food, like laksa and roti canai. And, be open to... um, new experience. People very friendly.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those sound like excellent tips. Thank you for sharing, Farah. It was nice talking to you about this.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you too! I enjoy our talk. Maybe next time, we can eat together and try new food.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Let’s plan for it soon. Have a great day, Farah!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Goodbye!
