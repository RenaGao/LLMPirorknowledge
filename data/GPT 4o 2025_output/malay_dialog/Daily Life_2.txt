**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thanks for taking the time to chat! I heard you have a favorite meal you like to cook. Can you tell me about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, hello! I like to cook nasi lemak. It is, um, rice with coconut milk and... many things.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! What do you usually serve with it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I serve with sambal, it is spicy sauce, and... um, fried peanuts, and egg, and cucumber.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice! How do you prepare the rice?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** First, I wash rice. Then, I cook with coconut milk and... pandan leaf for smell good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Pandan leaf? That must add a nice aroma. How about the sambal?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, pandan is very nice. For sambal, I blend chili, onion, and garlic. Then, I fry with oil and add... um, how to say... sugar and salt.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Do you add anything else to the sambal?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, sometimes I put... um, small fish, anchovies. It is crunchy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds tasty! How long does it take to make everything?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe one hour. Rice take time to cook, and sambal need to fry slow.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Do you make it often?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I make when I miss home. It is, um, comfort food for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It must remind you of Malaysia.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, very much. I like to share with friends too.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to try it sometime! Maybe you can show me how to make it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, I can show you. We can cook together next weekend?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect! I’m looking forward to it.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Great! Thank you for listening. I hope you will like nasi lemak.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure I will. Thanks for sharing your recipe with me. See you next weekend!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, see you! Have a good day!
