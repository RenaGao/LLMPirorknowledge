**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, hello. I want to, uh, return this shirt. It not fit me well.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you have the receipt with you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I have. Here it is.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you. Let me check it for you. Okay, it looks like you bought this last week. Our policy allows returns within 30 days. Is there anything wrong with the shirt?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, no damage. Just, um, too small for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, we can process the return. Would you like a refund or an exchange for a different size?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think, um, exchange is better. Can I get bigger size?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Let me check if we have a larger size in stock. Please wait a moment.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I wait.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good news! We have the size you need. Would you like to try it on first?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I try first. Where is, um, fitting room?

**Speaker A (NS):** The fitting rooms are just over there, on your right.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. I go try now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Take your time. Let me know if it fits.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** (After trying) Yes, this one is good. I take this size.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll process the exchange for you. Is there anything else you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, that all. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. You too, have nice day!
