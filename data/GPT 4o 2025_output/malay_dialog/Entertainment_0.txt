**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Do you have a favorite movie or TV show you like to watch?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, hello! Yes, I like... how to say... superhero movie. Like Marvel.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Marvel movies are great! Which one is your favorite?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think... Avengers. The one with, uh, all the heroes together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, "Avengers: Endgame"? That's a popular choice. What do you like about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like the action and... um, the story. Very exciting, and many... how to say... surprise?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, lots of surprises! Do you watch any TV shows?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I watch... um, "Stranger Things." It is about... kids and, uh, mystery.

**Speaker A (NS):** "Stranger Things" is really interesting! What do you think of the characters?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like Eleven. She is... um, strong and brave. And the friends, they are funny.

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree, the characters are great. Do you watch these shows with friends or family?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sometimes with friends. We, um, talk about it after. Very fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good time! Do you have any other shows you want to watch?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I want to watch... um, "The Crown." It is about, uh, the queen, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it's about the British royal family. It's very well-made. I think you'll enjoy it.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I hope so! I like history, so maybe I will like it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure you will. It's a great way to learn about history too.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think so. Thank you for, um, the suggestion.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Aiman! It was nice talking about movies and shows with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, nice talking with you too. Maybe we can watch together sometime?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a plan! Let's do it. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, you too! Goodbye!
