**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Do you have a moment to discuss our project deadlines?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, sure. I have time now. What we need to talk about?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We need to finalize the timeline for the new marketing campaign. Have you had a chance to review the tasks?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I look at it yesterday. Some task, I think, need more time. Like, the design part.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Which part of the design do you think will take longer?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** The, um, how to say... the logo and the color... matching? It need more detail.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the logo and color scheme. Yes, those are important. How much extra time do you think you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe, uh, two more days? I want to make it... um, perfect.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds reasonable. We can adjust the schedule to accommodate that. Is there anything else you’re concerned about?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, the content writing. I not sure if we have enough... um, information.

**Speaker A (NS):** We can arrange a meeting with the content team to gather more details. Would that help?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that will help a lot. Thank you for that.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Let’s set up a meeting for tomorrow. Does 10 a.m. work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, 10 a.m. is good. I will prepare some question.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll send out the meeting invite. Anything else you’d like to discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, no, I think that all for now. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Aiman. Let’s keep in touch if anything comes up. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, thank you. You too! See you tomorrow.
