**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, please. I am looking for... um, hotel. Nearby hotel.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. Do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I think it is... um, "Green Park Hotel."

**Speaker A (NS):** Green Park Hotel? Yes, I know it. It's not too far from here. Do you have a map or GPS?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I have phone, but... how to say... no internet now.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries. I can give you directions. You need to go straight down this road and then turn left at the second traffic light.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, straight and then left at... second light?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right. After you turn left, the hotel will be on your right side, about two blocks down.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Two blocks... okay, I understand. Thank you very much!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Do you need any more help with anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, no, I think I am okay. Just... um, hope I find it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure you will. If you get lost, just ask someone else. People here are friendly.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I see. Everyone is very nice. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Have a great stay at the hotel!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I will. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care and safe travels!
