**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! How have you been lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! I am good, thank you. But, um, I want to be more... how to say... healthy?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great to hear! Staying healthy is important. Do you have any specific goals in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to eat better and, uh, do more exercise. But I not sure where to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, I can help with that. For eating better, you could start by adding more fruits and vegetables to your meals. Do you like them?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I like fruits. Vegetables... um, some I like, some not so much.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay! You can try different ways to cook them. Maybe youâ€™ll find a new favorite. How about exercise? Do you have any activities you enjoy?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like to, um, walk in the park. But I think I need more... um, strong exercise?

**Speaker A (NS):** Walking is a great start! You can add some jogging or cycling if you want more intensity. Do you have a bike?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I have a bike. I can try cycling more. Is it good for health?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Cycling is excellent for your heart and muscles. Plus, it's fun. How often do you plan to exercise?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe three times a week? Is that enough?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's a good start. Just make sure to listen to your body and rest when needed. Do you have any other questions?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, what about drink water? How much is good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Drinking water is very important. Aim for about eight glasses a day, but it can vary depending on your activity level.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will try that. Thank you for advice!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Aiman! I'm glad I could help. Let me know how it goes.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I will. Thank you again. Um, see you later?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, see you later! Take care and good luck with your healthy journey!
