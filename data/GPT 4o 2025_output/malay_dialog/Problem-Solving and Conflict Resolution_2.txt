**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Do you have a moment to discuss the project issue we’re facing?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, um, I have time now. What is the problem we need to fix?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, the main issue is with the data entry errors. We need a plan to reduce them. Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I see. Maybe we can, um, make a checklist? To help check the data before submit.

**Speaker A (NS):** A checklist sounds useful. Do you think we should also have a training session?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, training is good. Maybe we can, uh, show how to use the system better?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. We can organize a session next week. How about we also create a guidebook?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Guidebook, yes. It can help when they forget, um, steps. I can help write it.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be fantastic, Aiman. Should we also set up a regular review meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, review meeting is good. Maybe every two weeks, we check progress?

**Speaker A (NS):** Every two weeks sounds perfect. We can track improvements and adjust if needed.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I agree. We can start next week, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, let’s start next week. I’ll send out an email to everyone about the plan.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Good idea. I will prepare checklist and guidebook draft.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you, Aiman. I appreciate your help. Anything else we should consider?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe we can ask feedback after training? To see if they understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great suggestion. Feedback will help us improve the process.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, feedback is important. I think we have good plan now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree. Thanks for your input, Aiman. Let’s catch up later to finalize everything.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, thank you too. We will talk again soon. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Aiman! Have a great day!
