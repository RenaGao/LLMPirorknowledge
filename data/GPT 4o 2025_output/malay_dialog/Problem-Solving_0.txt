**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! I heard you were upset with me. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, hello! Yes, um, I think we need to talk. I feel... how to say... confused?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I’m here to listen. What happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Last week, you say you come to my house, but you not come. I wait long time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, I’m really sorry about that. I thought I sent you a message to reschedule. Did you not get it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I not see message. Maybe I miss it. My phone sometimes... uh, problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Technology can be tricky. I should have called to make sure you knew.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, maybe call is better. I was worry you forget.

**Speaker A (NS):** I completely understand. I didn’t mean to make you worry. Can we plan another time to meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I like that. Maybe this weekend? I free on Saturday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Saturday works for me too. How about we meet at the café at 3 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, 3 p.m. is good. I will check my phone for message this time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll make sure to call you too, just in case.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. I feel better now. Sorry if I was... um, too upset.

**Speaker A (NS):** No need to apologize. I’m glad we talked about it. Communication is important.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, very important. I will see you Saturday, then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Looking forward to it! Take care, Aiman.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Goodbye!
