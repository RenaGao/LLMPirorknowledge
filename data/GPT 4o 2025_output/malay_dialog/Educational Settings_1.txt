**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Are you ready for the test next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, hello! I think not ready yet. The test is... how to say... difficult for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Which part do you find most challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** The, uh, writing part. I always make mistake with grammar.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's common. Maybe we can study together? I can help with grammar.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, that is good idea! We can meet, um, after class?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, after class works. Do you have any study tips that help you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like to, uh, read notes and... um, make small cards. Flashcards?

**Speaker A (NS):** Flashcards are great! They help with memorization. Do you use them for vocabulary?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, for vocabulary. And sometimes, I listen to... how to say... audio book?

**Speaker A (NS):** Audiobooks? That's a smart way to improve listening skills.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, audiobooks. They help me understand better.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's excellent. We can also practice speaking if you want.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to practice speaking. It is, um, good for test.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Speaking practice will boost your confidence.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you for help. I feel more... um, ready now.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Aiman. Let's meet tomorrow after class, then?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, tomorrow is good. Thank you again!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** See you tomorrow! Bye!
