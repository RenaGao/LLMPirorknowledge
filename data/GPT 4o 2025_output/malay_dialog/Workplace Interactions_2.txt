**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, everyone! Thanks for joining the meeting planning session. Can we start by deciding on the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, um, I think we need to talk about... uh, project deadline first.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good point. The project deadline is important. Anything else we should include?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe, um, discuss... how to say... team roles? Who do what?

**Speaker A (NS):** Discussing team roles is a great idea. We can clarify responsibilities. What about the meeting time?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes. Meeting time. I think... um, morning is good. But, uh, what you think?

**Speaker A (NS):** Morning works for me. How about 10 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, 10 a.m. is okay. We also need... um, talk about budget?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely, the budget is crucial. We can allocate some time for that. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe... feedback session? To improve, uh, next project?

**Speaker A (NS):** A feedback session is a great addition. It helps us learn and improve. Should we summarize the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, please. I think... um, first is project deadline, then team roles, meeting time, budget, and feedback.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! That sounds comprehensive. Are we all set for the meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think we ready. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm glad we could plan this together. Anything else before we wrap up?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I think that all. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Thanks for your input. Looking forward to the meeting. Goodbye!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Goodbye! See you at the meeting!
