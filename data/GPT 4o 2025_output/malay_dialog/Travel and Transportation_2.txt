**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, everyone! So, we're planning a group vacation. Do you have any ideas for where we should go?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, hello! I think... maybe we can go to beach? I hear... um, how to say... many people like it.

**Speaker A (NS):** A beach sounds great! Do you have a specific place in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, maybe... Langkawi? It is very... um, beautiful and have many things to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** Langkawi is a wonderful choice! What activities do you think we should try there?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We can... um, go swimming, and also... how to say... see the big bird park?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean the bird sanctuary? That sounds fun! Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, and maybe... we can try the cable car. I hear it is very... um, high and nice view.

**Speaker A (NS):** The cable car ride is definitely a must-do! How about food? Any local dishes we should try?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! We must try... nasi lemak and... um, satay. Very delicious!

**Speaker A (NS):** Nasi lemak and satay sound delicious! How about accommodation? Do you have any suggestions?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe we can stay at... how to say... resort? It is near the beach.

**Speaker A (NS):** A beach resort sounds perfect. Should we book in advance?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think... better to book early. Many people go there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. Let's make sure we book soon. Is there anything else we need to plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe... we need to check... how to say... transport? Like, how to go there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, transportation is important. We can look into flights or maybe a ferry.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, ferry is good. I think it is... um, cheaper and nice view.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, we have Langkawi, activities, food, accommodation, and transport planned. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think... that is all. We can... um, talk more later if need.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! Thanks for your input. Let's finalize everything soon. Talk to you later!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, thank you! Talk later. Bye!
