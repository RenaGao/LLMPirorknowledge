**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! I heard you're planning a cultural event. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! Yes, I am planning, um, event to show Malay culture. We want to share with others.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! What kind of activities are you thinking of including?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We will have, um, traditional dance. And also, food... Malay food for everyone to try.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I love trying new foods! What dishes will you serve?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We will have nasi lemak, and maybe satay. They are very, um, popular in Malaysia.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those are delicious choices! Will there be any workshops or demonstrations?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we plan to have, um, batik painting. People can learn to make their own design.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! How can people join the event?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** They can, um, register online. We will put the link on social media.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! Do you need any help with organizing?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, maybe help with, um, setting up the place. It is a bit, uh, big job.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d be happy to help! Just let me know what you need.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I will, um, let you know soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Is there anything else you’re planning for the event?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We also think about, um, music performance. Traditional music, like gamelan.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be amazing! I’m sure everyone will enjoy it.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I hope so. We want everyone to, um, feel welcome and happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure they will. It sounds like a fantastic event.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I am, um, excited to share our culture.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m excited too! Let’s catch up soon to finalize the details.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, let’s do that. Thank you for your help!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Aiman. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, see you soon!
