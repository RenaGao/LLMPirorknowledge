**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Are you thinking about buying a new phone today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, um, I want to buy new phone. My old one, uh, not working well.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What features are you looking for in a new phone?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I need, um, good camera. And also, battery... long time, uh, lasting.

**Speaker A (NS):** A good camera and long battery life. That makes sense. Do you have a specific brand in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I think maybe Samsung or, uh, Apple. They are, how to say... popular?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, they are very popular. Do you prefer Android or iOS?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I use Android before, but iOS... um, I hear it is good too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Both have their advantages. Do you need a lot of storage for apps and photos?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, storage is important. I take many, uh, pictures and videos.

**Speaker A (NS):** In that case, you might want to consider a model with at least 128GB of storage.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, okay. That is good idea. And, um, what about price?

**Speaker A (NS):** Prices can vary a lot. Do you have a budget in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think, um, not more than 1000... uh, dollars.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thatâ€™s a reasonable budget. You should be able to find a good phone within that range.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. I will, um, look more and decide.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Let me know if you need more help.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Aiman. Good luck with your purchase!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care!
