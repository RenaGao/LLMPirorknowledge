**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It's nice to meet you. Do you have any hobbies or interests?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! Nice to meet you too. Um, I like... how to say... drawing and painting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that's wonderful! What kind of things do you like to draw or paint?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like to draw nature. Trees, um, and... sea. I find it very... relaxing.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds peaceful. Do you often go to the beach or the forest for inspiration?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, sometimes. I go with family. We have picnic and I draw. You like nature too?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I do! I enjoy hiking and taking photos of landscapes. It's a great way to unwind.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, hiking! I want to try. But, um, not sure where to start. Any advice?

**Speaker A (NS):** Start with easy trails. Maybe a local park? It's good to go with friends for safety.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Good idea. I will ask my friend. Maybe we can go together. Thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Do you have any other interests besides art and nature?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like music. I play... um, guitar. Not very good, but I try.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Playing an instrument is a wonderful skill. Do you play any particular songs?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I play... simple songs. Like, um, pop songs. Easy to learn.

**Speaker A (NS):** Pop songs are fun! Maybe we can share music recommendations sometime.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I like that! We can talk more about music.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. It's been nice chatting with you. Let's keep in touch.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, nice talking to you too. Thank you for the advice.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Goodbye!
