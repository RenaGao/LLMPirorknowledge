**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, please. I am looking for... um, how to say... the big tower in this town.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you mean the City Tower?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, City Tower! I want to go there. Can you tell me the way?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! From here, you need to go straight down this street until you reach the main square.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Main square... um, is it far?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not too far, maybe a ten-minute walk. After the square, turn left at the big fountain.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Turn left at fountain. Okay, I understand. Then what?

**Speaker A (NS):** Then, you’ll see the tower straight ahead. It’s hard to miss!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, okay. Thank you. I think I can find it now.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Do you need any more help?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, no, I think I am good. Thank you very much for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Enjoy your visit to the City Tower.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day!
