**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, how are you today? Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! I am good, thank you. Um, I think to have picnic with family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! Where are you planning to go for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We want to go to, uh, the big park near my house. It have... um, many trees and nice place to sit.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds perfect. Do you have everything you need for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think so. We bring food, like sandwiches and fruits. And, um, drinks also.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Are you planning any activities while you're there?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, maybe play... uh, how to say... flying disc? And also, we can walk around.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, a frisbee! That’s a fun idea. Walking sounds nice too. Is there anything else you need to prepare?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe I need to check weather. If rain, we cannot go.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good thinking. It’s always best to check the weather. Do you have a backup plan if it rains?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, if rain, we stay home and watch movie together. It also fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice backup plan. Watching a movie with family is always enjoyable. What movie would you watch?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe, um, the new one... everyone talk about it. I forget name.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, I’m sure you’ll remember it later. It sounds like you have a wonderful weekend planned.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I hope so. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I hope you have a great time with your family.
