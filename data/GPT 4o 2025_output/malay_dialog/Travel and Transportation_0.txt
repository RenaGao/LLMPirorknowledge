**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, how was your trip to the new city? I heard you went last weekend.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, it was very nice. I go to, um, how to say... the big city, Kuala Lumpur.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds exciting! What did you do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I visit many place. First, I go to the... um, tower, the tall one.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you mean the Petronas Towers?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, Petronas Towers! Very tall and beautiful. I take many photo.

**Speaker A (NS):** I bet the view was amazing. Did you try any local food?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I eat... um, nasi lemak. It is very delicious. I like the... um, spicy sambal.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nasi lemak is a classic! Did you visit any other attractions?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I also go to the... um, market. How to say... many shop and people?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the Central Market?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, Central Market! I buy some... um, souvenir for family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Did you have any challenges while you were there?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, a little. The traffic is... how to say... very busy. But I use train, so okay.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea to use the train. It’s usually faster. Would you visit again?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to go again. Maybe see more place next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! I’m glad you had a good time.
