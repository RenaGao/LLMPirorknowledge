**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, welcome to the team! I'm here to help you get started with your first task. Do you have any questions before we begin?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello, thank you. Um, I think I understand, but maybe you can explain more, please?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Your first task is to organize the files in our shared drive. We need them sorted by project and date. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, I see. So, I need to put files in folder by project and then by date, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And make sure to label each folder clearly. If you need help with the naming, just let me know.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will do that. Um, how to say... if I not sure about project name, what should I do?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! You can check the project list on our team site, or you can ask me anytime.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will check the list. And, um, how many files are there to organize?

**Speaker A (NS):** There are about 200 files, but don't worry, you can take your time. It's not urgent.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, 200 files. I will start today. Maybe finish by tomorrow?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. If you run into any issues, just send me a message.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will do that. Thank you for help. Um, anything else I need to know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Just remember to save your work regularly. And if you have any ideas for improving the system, feel free to share.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will remember. I think I can do this. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm sure you'll do great. Let's catch up tomorrow to see how it's going.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we can talk tomorrow. Thank you, and see you then!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow! Have a great day organizing the files.
