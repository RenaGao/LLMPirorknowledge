**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! I was curious, could you tell me about your favorite holiday in Malaysia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, um... my favorite holiday is Hari Raya. It is very special for us.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! What do you usually do during Hari Raya?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We, um, visit family and friends. We also, uh, eat a lot of food, like rendang and ketupat.

**Speaker A (NS):** Rendang and ketupat? What are those?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Rendang is, um, spicy meat dish. Ketupat is rice in, uh, leaf... how to say... leaf package?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see! That sounds delicious. Do you have any special traditions?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we, um, give duit raya to children. It is like, uh, money gift.
