**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Are you ready for the exam next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, hello! I am... not so ready. The exam is... how to say... difficult for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Which part do you find most challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** The, uh, writing part. I have problem with grammar and... um, vocabulary.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Maybe we can study together? I can help with your grammar.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, that is good idea! We can meet... um, after class?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, after class works for me. Do you have any specific topics you want to focus on?

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, we can go over essay structures and practice some examples.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! And, um, I can help you with... math if you need.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great! I could use some help with the math problems.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, we help each other. It is... win-win, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, a win-win situation! Do you want to meet at the library?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, library is good. We meet... um, 3 p.m.?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, 3 p.m. it is. I’ll bring some practice questions.
