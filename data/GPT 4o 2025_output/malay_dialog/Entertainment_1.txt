**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Do you have any plans for this evening?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, not really. I think maybe just stay at home. Why you ask?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could go out for dinner. Do you have a favorite restaurant?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! I like the, um, Italian place... how to say... with the pizza and pasta?

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you mean the one on Main Street, Bella Italia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, Bella Italia! I like their food very much. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! What time should we meet there?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe, um, 7 o'clock? Is it okay for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, 7 o'clock works perfectly. After dinner, do you want to do something else?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, maybe we can, uh, watch movie? I hear new movie is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Do you know which movie you want to see?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think, um, the one with... superhero? Everyone talk about it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the new superhero movie! I've heard it's really good. Let's check the showtimes.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we check later. I hope not too late.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'll look it up and let you know. Should I book the tickets in advance?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, please. Better to book early, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I'll take care of it. So, dinner at 7 and then the movie?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is good plan. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Aiman. I'm looking forward to it!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Me too! See you later at Bella Italia.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you there! Have a great afternoon until then.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, you too! Bye!
