**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! I was wondering if you could tell me about a tradition or festival from your culture. I'm really curious to learn more.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, sure! Um, we have Hari Raya. It is, uh, very important festival for us.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! What do you usually do during Hari Raya?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We, um, we visit family and friends. And, uh, we eat a lot of food, like rendang and ketupat.

**Speaker A (NS):** Rendang and ketupat? What are those?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Rendang is, um, spicy meat dish. Very delicious. Ketupat is rice, uh, cooked in leaves.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Is there anything else special about the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we also, um, give money to children. It is called "duit raya."

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, like a gift for the kids? That's nice! Do you have any special clothes you wear?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we wear, um, traditional clothes. Baju Melayu for men and baju kurung for women.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those must look beautiful. How long does the celebration last?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Usually, um, one month. But first few days are most, uh, busy.

**Speaker A (NS):** A whole month? That's amazing! Do you have any favorite part of the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like, um, meeting family. And also, the food! Very good.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine! It sounds like a wonderful time. Thank you for sharing, Farah.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You're welcome! I hope you can, um, join one day.

**Speaker A (NS):** I would love that! It was great learning about Hari Raya. Thanks again!
