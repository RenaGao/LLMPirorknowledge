**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! I heard you’re having some trouble with your internet connection. Can I help?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! Yes, um, my internet is very slow. I try to fix, but not sure how.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Have you tried restarting your router?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, I restart... um, the box, but still slow.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, sometimes it helps to check the cables. Are they all connected properly?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Cables? Oh, I think... they are okay. I check again.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Also, how many devices are using the internet at the same time?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe... five? My phone, laptop, and... my family also use.

**Speaker A (NS):** That could slow it down. Maybe try disconnecting a few devices and see if it helps.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, okay. I will try that. Um, if still slow, what can I do?

**Speaker A (NS):** You might need to contact your service provider. They can check if there’s an issue on their end.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think I call them. But, um, what to say?

**Speaker A (NS):** Just explain the problem, like “My internet is slow, and I’ve tried restarting the router and checking cables.”

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I say that. And maybe they can help fix?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, they should be able to help. If not, they might send a technician.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Technician? Oh, that is good. I hope they can fix fast.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure they will. Let me know if you need more help.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you very much! I will try now and call them.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Aiman. Good luck with it!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I will update you later. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Aiman! Take care!
