**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! I was thinking about our dinner plans. Have you noticed any differences in dining etiquette between here and Malaysia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, there are some difference. Um, in Malaysia, we often eat with hand, especially rice and curry. Here, more with fork and knife, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's true. Eating with hands is less common here. Is there a specific way to do it in Malaysia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we use right hand only. It is, um, polite. Left hand is for, uh, other things.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. That's interesting! What about when you're a guest at someone's house?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** As guest, we wait for host to start eat. And, um, we say "terima kasih" after meal. It mean thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a nice gesture. Here, we often bring a small gift for the host. Is that common in Malaysia too?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, sometimes we bring kuih, um, like sweet cake. It is good manners.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I love kuih! What about talking during meals? Is it common to have conversations?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we talk, but not too loud. Respect for others eating. How about here?

**Speaker A (NS):** We usually talk during meals, but it depends on the setting. In formal dinners, we might be quieter.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I see. And, um, in Malaysia, we don't leave food on plate. It is, uh, wasteful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good practice. Here, we try not to waste food too, but sometimes it happens.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, same everywhere, I think. Um, what about tipping? In Malaysia, not so common.

**Speaker A (NS):** Tipping is quite common here, especially in restaurants. It's usually around 15-20%.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I must remember that. Thank you for telling me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! It's always good to learn about different cultures. Anything else you find different?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe how we sit. In Malaysia, sometimes we sit on floor for meal, like family gathering.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a lovely tradition. We usually sit at tables, but I think sitting on the floor sounds cozy.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, it is nice. Thank you for sharing about here too.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Aiman. It was great to learn from each other. Let's plan our dinner soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I look forward to it. See you soon!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you soon, Aiman! Take care!
