**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you looking to buy something special today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! Yes, I want to buy, um, how to say... a bag. For my sister.

**Speaker A (NS):** A bag for your sister? That sounds nice. Do you have a specific type in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think... a handbag. She like, um, colorful one.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! Have you found one you like here at the market?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I see one. But, um, the price is... how to say... too high?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. You want to negotiate the price?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes. I want to try. But I not sure how to do it well.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! You can start by asking if they can offer a discount. Maybe say, "Can you give me a better price?"

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I try. Um, can you give me better price for this bag?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect! If they say no, you can mention you saw a similar one for less elsewhere.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes. I can say, "I see same bag, um, cheaper at other place."

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And if they agree to lower the price, you can decide if it’s good for you.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will think. If price is good, I buy. If not, I look more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Remember to be polite and smile; it helps a lot.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, smile is important. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I hope you find the perfect bag for your sister.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I hope so too. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day at the market!
