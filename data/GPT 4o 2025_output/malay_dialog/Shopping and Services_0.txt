**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! Um, I looking for... how to say... a thing for cleaning floor.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean a mop or a vacuum cleaner?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, vacuum cleaner. I need for my house.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any specific features in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I want one that is... easy to use and not too heavy.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. We have a lightweight model that’s very user-friendly. Would you like to see it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, please. That would be good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Here it is. It’s cordless and has a long battery life. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, this is nice. But, um, how about... the price?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s currently on sale for $150. Does that fit your budget?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, a bit high. Do you have... cheaper one?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, we have another model for $100. It’s slightly heavier but still easy to use.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I think I will take this one. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Is there anything else you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, that all. Thank you very much.
