**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Are you ready to discuss the topic for our study group today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello! Yes, I am ready. But, um, this topic is... how to say... a bit difficult for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, we can work through it together. What part do you find challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** The part about... um, the economic... uh, impact? I not sure how to explain it well.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the economic impact. Do you mean how changes in the economy affect businesses?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes! That one. I understand a little, but to explain is hard.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's break it down. When the economy grows, businesses usually do better because people have more money to spend. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I understand. So, when economy is good, people buy more things?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And when the economy slows down, people might spend less, which can affect businesses negatively.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I see. So, business must... um, adapt to changes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, businesses need to adapt to economic changes to survive. They might change their prices or offer new products.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I think I get it now. Thank you for explain.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Do you feel more confident about discussing this in the group?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I feel better now. I will try to explain like you did.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! If you need more help, just let me know. Are we ready to wrap up?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think we are done. Thank you again for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Aiman. Good luck with the study group!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I will do my best. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Aiman! See you next time.
