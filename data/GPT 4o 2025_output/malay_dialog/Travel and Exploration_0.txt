**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Are you excited about our trip to the new city this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, very excited! Um, I think it will be fun. We have many plan, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! We have a lot planned. Do you know what you want to do first when we get there?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, maybe... we can visit the big museum? I hear it is very... how to say... interesting?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, interesting! The museum sounds like a great idea. Do you know if there are any special exhibits?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I not sure, but I can check online. Maybe they have... um, art from famous people?

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be amazing. After the museum, do you want to try some local food?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to try! I hear they have good... um, street food? Like in Malaysia, but different.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, street food! It's always fun to try new flavors. Do you have any specific dishes in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not really, but I like spicy food. Maybe something spicy and... um, with rice?

**Speaker A (NS):** Spicy and with rice, got it! We can ask locals for recommendations. How about in the evening? Any plans?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Evening... maybe we can see the city lights? I hear it is very beautiful at night.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. We can take a walk and enjoy the view. Do you want to plan anything for the next day?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, maybe we can go shopping? I want to buy... how to say... souvenir for family.

**Speaker A (NS):** Souvenirs, yes! Shopping is a great idea. We can find something unique for everyone.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think they will like it. And after shopping, maybe we can relax at a café?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely, a café sounds nice. We can sit and talk about our trip. Anything else you want to add?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I think that is all. I am happy with the plan. Thank you for helping!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Aiman! I'm looking forward to it. Let's meet at the train station at 9 a.m. on Saturday?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, 9 a.m. is good. I will see you there!
