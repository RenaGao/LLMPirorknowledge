**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! Thanks for meeting up. Are you ready to plan the surprise party for Sarah?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I ready! Um, we need to think about... how to say... the place?

**Speaker A (NS):** The venue, right? Do you have any ideas where we could hold it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe at my house? It is big enough, and my parents can help.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect! What about the date? When should we have it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think, um, next Saturday? She not busy then, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Next Saturday works! How about the guest list? Who should we invite?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes. We invite her close friends, maybe... um, ten people?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten people sounds good. What about food and drinks? Any preferences?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We can have, um, pizza and some... how to say... snacks?

**Speaker A (NS):** Snacks, yes! Pizza and snacks are great. Do you think we need a cake?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, cake is must! Sarah like chocolate cake very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Chocolate cake it is! Should we plan any activities or games?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe we can play... um, board games? Sarah like those.

**Speaker A (NS):** Board games are a fun idea. Do you need help with decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, please. I not so good with decoration. You can help?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I can help with that. We can keep it simple but nice.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! Um, what time should we start the party?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 6 p.m.? That gives us time to set up everything.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, 6 p.m. is good. I will tell everyone to come early.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I think we have a solid plan. Anything else we need to cover?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I think we have all. Thank you for help, really.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Aiman! I'm excited for the party. See you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, see you soon! Bye!
