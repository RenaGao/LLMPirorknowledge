**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, thanks for meeting with me today! I’d love to hear about a tradition or festival from your country. Could you share one with me?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, hello! I can talk about Mid-Autumn Festival. It is, um, very important in Hong Kong.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! What do people usually do during the Mid-Autumn Festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We, um, we eat mooncakes. They are sweet, and, uh, have egg yolk inside sometimes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Mooncakes sound delicious! Is there anything else that happens during the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we also, um, light lanterns. Children like to carry them at night. It is very... how to say... beautiful?

**Speaker A (NS):** Beautiful, yes! Do you have any special memories from celebrating the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes! I remember, um, when I was small, my family go to park. We see big lanterns, very colorful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. Is there a story or meaning behind the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is about, um, Chang’e. She is, uh, moon goddess. People tell story about her.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So, it’s a festival with a lot of history and stories. Do you celebrate it with your family every year?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, every year. We eat dinner together, and, um, look at the moon. It is, uh, family time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful tradition. Thank you for sharing it with me, Mei. I’d love to experience it someday.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You are welcome! If you come to Hong Kong, I can show you. It is, um, very fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d like that very much. Thank you again, Mei. It was great learning about the Mid-Autumn Festival.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you too! I am happy to share. Um, see you next time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, see you next time! Have a great day, Mei.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! Goodbye!
