**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, thanks for meeting with me today! I heard you want to plan a cultural event. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, um, I want to make event for, uh, sharing Cantonese culture. Like, um, food and music.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! What kind of food are you thinking of including?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, maybe dim sum and, um, roast duck. They are very, uh, popular in Cantonese food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yum, that sounds delicious! How about the music? Do you have any specific ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think, um, Cantonese opera. It is, uh, very traditional. And maybe some pop music too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great mix! How do you plan to organize the event? Do you need any help?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I think I need help with, uh, finding place. And maybe, um, how to say... schedule?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. We can look for a venue and create a schedule together. When are you thinking of holding the event?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe next month? I want to, um, make sure have enough time to plan.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. We can start by listing everything we need to do. Do you have a budget in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, not sure yet. I need to, uh, check how much for food and place.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, we can work on that together. It’s important to have a clear budget. Anything else you’re thinking about?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, maybe, um, some games or, uh, activities for people to join.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a fun idea! It will make the event more interactive. Do you have any specific games in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, maybe mahjong? It is, uh, very popular game in Cantonese culture.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect choice! Mahjong will definitely engage people. Let’s make a list of everything and start planning.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, thank you for help! I am, um, excited to share my culture.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m excited too! Let’s meet again soon to finalize the details. 

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we meet again. Thank you, and see you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Mei. See you soon!
