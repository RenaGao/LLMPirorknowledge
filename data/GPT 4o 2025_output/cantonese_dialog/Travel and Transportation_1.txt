**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, please. I am looking for, um, how to say... hotel nearby.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is... um, "Green Tree Hotel."

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the Green Tree Hotel. It's not too far from here. Do you have a map or a phone with GPS?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I have phone, but, um, no internet now.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Let me guide you. You need to go straight down this street for about two blocks.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Two blocks, okay. Then what I do?

**Speaker A (NS):** After two blocks, you'll see a big supermarket on your right. Turn left there.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Turn left at supermarket, yes. Then?

**Speaker A (NS):** Keep walking for another block, and the hotel will be on your right side.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I understand. Walk two blocks, turn left, then one block more. Hotel on right.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Do you need any more help with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I think I can find. Thank you very much for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! If you get lost, just ask someone else. People here are friendly.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will. Thank you again. You are very kind.

**Speaker A (NS):** My pleasure. Have a great stay at the hotel!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! Have a nice day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Goodbye!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Goodbye!
