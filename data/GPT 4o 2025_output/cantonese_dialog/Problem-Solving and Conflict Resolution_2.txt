**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Wing, thanks for meeting with me. We need to figure out how to handle the project deadline. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes, hello. I think we can, uh, maybe work more hours? Like, stay late?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a possibility. But let's see if we can manage our time better first. Have you checked the task list recently?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, task list... I look yesterday. Some task is, um, not finish yet. Maybe we can, uh, divide work more?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. We can split the tasks. Which ones do you think you can handle?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I can do the, um, report writing. And also, the... how to say... the numbers part?

**Speaker A (NS):** The data analysis?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, data analysis. I can do that. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I'll take care of the presentation slides and the client communication. Does that sound okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that is good. Um, when we need finish by?

**Speaker A (NS):** We should aim to complete everything by Friday. That gives us time to review. Do you think that's doable?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Friday... yes, I think can do. Maybe we check again on, um, Thursday?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, let's have a quick meeting on Thursday to see our progress. Anything else you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, no, I think okay. If I have question, I will ask you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, feel free to reach out anytime. Thanks for your cooperation, Wing.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you too. We will do good job, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Let's make it happen. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, talk soon. Goodbye!
