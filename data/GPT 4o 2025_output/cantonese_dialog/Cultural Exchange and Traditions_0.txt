**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, it's great to see you! I was wondering if you could tell me about a tradition or festival from your culture. I'm really curious!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, hello! Yes, I can talk about... um, Mid-Autumn Festival. It is very important in my culture.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! What do you usually do during the Mid-Autumn Festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We, um, we eat mooncake. It is sweet cake with... how to say... lotus seed paste inside.

**Speaker A (NS):** Mooncakes sound delicious! Is there anything else you do during the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we also... um, we look at the moon. It is very... uh, beautiful and round.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. Do you celebrate with family or friends?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, with family. We have dinner together. It is... um, time for family to be close.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's wonderful. Is there a special story or meaning behind the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, there is story about Chang'e. She is... um, lady who live on the moon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I've heard a little about that story. It's fascinating! Do you have any special memories from celebrating the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, when I was child, I play with... um, lanterns. It is very fun and colorful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Lanterns must make the night so vibrant! Do you still play with them now?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Not much now, but I like to see children play. It remind me of... um, my childhood.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's really nice. Thank you for sharing all this with me, Mei. I learned a lot!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You are welcome! I am happy to share. Thank you for listen.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Let's catch up again soon. Maybe we can try some mooncakes together next time.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that would be good! I will bring some for you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Take care, Mei. See you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, see you soon! Bye!
