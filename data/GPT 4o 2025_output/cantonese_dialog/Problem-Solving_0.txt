**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, I heard you were upset about something I said. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, um, I think maybe you say something not nice about my cooking?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, I didn’t mean it that way! I actually loved your cooking. I might have said it wrong.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I see. Maybe I misunderstand. You say, um, "too spicy," but I think you mean not good.

**Speaker A (NS):** I meant it was spicy in a good way! I really enjoyed it. Sorry for the confusion.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, okay, okay. I feel better now. Thank you for explain.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I’m glad we cleared that up. Is there anything else you want to talk about?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, no, I think that is all. I just worry you not like my food.

**Speaker A (NS):** I love your food, Mei. You’re a great cook. Let’s have dinner again soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes, we can do that. I make something new next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect! Let me know when you’re free.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I will tell you. Thank you for talk with me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Mei. I’m always here if you need to chat.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, I appreciate. Um, see you soon?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely, see you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bye-bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, take care!
