**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, how have you been lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi! I am good, thank you. But, um, I want to be more healthy. Can you give me some advice?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Staying healthy is important. Do you have any specific goals in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I want to, um, eat better and maybe do more exercise. But I not sure where to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great start. For eating better, try to include more fruits and vegetables in your meals. Do you like cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like cooking. But sometimes I cook same thing, like rice and chicken.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good base! You can add different vegetables or try new recipes to make it more interesting. How about exercise? Do you have any activities you enjoy?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I like walking. But I think maybe I need do more, like... how to say... running?

**Speaker A (NS):** Running is a great way to stay fit. You can start with short distances and gradually increase. Do you have a park nearby?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, there is a park near my home. I can go there. But, um, I worry about time. I busy with work.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Even short sessions, like 20 minutes, can be effective. Maybe you can fit it in during your lunch break or after work?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think I can try after work. It is good idea. Thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Also, remember to stay hydrated and get enough sleep. They are important too.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, sleep. I sometimes sleep late. I will try to sleep early.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good plan. Consistent sleep helps a lot. Is there anything else you want to know?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I think this is good start. Thank you for your help!

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Mei! I'm glad I could help. Let's catch up again soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, let's do that. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Mei! Take care and good luck with your healthy habits!
