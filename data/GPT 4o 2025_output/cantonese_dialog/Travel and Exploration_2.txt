**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Can I help you with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, please. I am looking for... um, how to say... the big park with the statue?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you mean Central Park with the famous statue?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, Central Park! I want to go there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, it's not too far from here. Do you know where Main Street is?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Main Street... um, I think I pass it before. Is it near the big shop?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly! From Main Street, you walk straight for about ten minutes.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Walk straight... ten minutes. Okay, then what I do?

**Speaker A (NS):** You'll see a large fountain. Turn left there, and the park entrance will be right ahead.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Turn left at fountain. I understand. Thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Do you need any more help with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, no, I think I am okay. I just follow your way.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Enjoy your time at the park. It's a lovely place to relax.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I hear it is very nice. I want to see the statue.

**Speaker A (NS):** The statue is beautiful. Make sure to take some photos!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will take many photos. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Have a great day exploring.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, you too! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care and enjoy your visit!
