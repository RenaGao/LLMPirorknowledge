**Speaker A (NS):** I see. How long have you been experiencing this headache?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe three days. It is, um, very strong sometimes.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Do you have any other symptoms, like nausea or dizziness?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes. I feel, uh, dizzy when I stand up. And sometimes, um, stomach not good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, that sounds uncomfortable. Have you taken any medication for it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I take, um, how to say... medicine for pain. But it not help much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Painkillers, right? It’s important to find out what’s causing the headache. Have you had enough rest and water?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, maybe not enough water. I try to drink more now.
