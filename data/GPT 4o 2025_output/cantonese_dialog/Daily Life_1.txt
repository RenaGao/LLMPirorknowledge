**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I think maybe go picnic with family. Weather is nice, so good time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! Where are you planning to have the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We think about... um, how to say... the big park near the river.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, the Riverside Park? That's a great spot!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, Riverside Park! We like it there. Many trees and... um, space for children to play.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! What kind of food are you planning to bring?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We bring sandwiches, fruit, and... um, some snacks. Maybe also, uh, barbecue?

**Speaker A (NS):** Barbecue sounds delicious! Do you need to bring a grill?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we have small grill. My brother will help with cooking.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Do you have any activities planned for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we play games. Like, um, badminton and... how to say... flying disc?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, a frisbee! That sounds like a lot of fun.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, frisbee! Children love it. And maybe we also take a walk.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a perfect day. I hope you all have a wonderful time!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I hope so too. And you, any plan for weekend?

**Speaker A (NS):** I might just relax at home, maybe catch up on some reading.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** That is nice too. Relaxing is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Well, enjoy your picnic, Mei!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! Have a good weekend. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Mei! Take care!
