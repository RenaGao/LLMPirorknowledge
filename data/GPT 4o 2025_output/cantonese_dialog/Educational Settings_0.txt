**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, how can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello! Um, I have question about the assignment. It is, uh, not clear for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, what part of the assignment are you having trouble with?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** The part about... um, research. We need to find, uh, sources? I not sure how many.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. You need to find at least three reliable sources for your research.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Three sources, okay. And, um, do we need to write... how to say... summary for each?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, you should write a brief summary for each source. Just a few sentences to explain the main points.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I understand. And, uh, the format? We use, um, APA style, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's correct, APA style for citations and references.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you. And, um, the deadline is... when?

**Speaker A (NS):** The deadline is next Friday. Do you think you'll have enough time?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think so. I will start, um, soon. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you very much. I will try my best.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Mei. I'm sure you'll do well.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you. Um, I will go now. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Mei! Good luck with your assignment.
