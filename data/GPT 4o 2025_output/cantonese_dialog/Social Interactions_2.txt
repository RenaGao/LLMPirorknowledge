**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, it's been a while! How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello! Yes, long time no see. I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I heard you moved to a new city. How's that going?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, I move to... um, how to say... a place with many trees and parks. It is nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds lovely! Do you like it there?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like it. It is quiet and... um, peaceful. But sometimes I miss the city.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. The city has its own charm. Have you made any new friends there?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I meet some people. They are very... um, friendly. We sometimes go to eat together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great to hear! What kind of food do you usually have?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We eat... um, local food. It is different but very tasty. I like the... um, how to say... spicy soup?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, spicy soup sounds delicious! Do you cook at home too?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I cook sometimes. I make... um, simple dishes. Like rice and vegetables.

**Speaker A (NS):** Simple is good! It's nice to have home-cooked meals. Do you have any plans to visit the city soon?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I plan to visit next month. I want to see family and friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful plan. I'm sure everyone will be happy to see you.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I hope so. I miss them very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, it was great catching up with you, Mei. Let's not wait so long to talk next time.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I agree. Thank you for calling. It was nice to talk.

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Mei. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! Bye-bye!
