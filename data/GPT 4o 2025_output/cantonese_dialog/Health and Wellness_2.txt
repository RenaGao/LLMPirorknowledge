**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How can I help you with your fitness goals today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, hello! I want to, uh, get more strong and healthy. Maybe lose some weight too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any specific exercises you enjoy or want to try?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like, um, running. But not too fast. And maybe, uh, lift weight? Is good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, running and weightlifting are both excellent. How often do you plan to exercise each week?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think... maybe three time a week? Is that okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Three times a week is a good start. Do you have any experience with weightlifting?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, not much. I try before, but not sure if I do right.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, I can show you some basic techniques. Do you have any fitness goals, like building muscle or improving endurance?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I want to, um, build muscle. And also, uh, run longer distance.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. We can create a balanced routine for both. Do you have any questions about nutrition?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. What should I eat for, um, more energy?

**Speaker A (NS):** Focus on a balanced diet with proteins, carbs, and healthy fats. Do you have any dietary restrictions?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I eat everything. But I like, um, rice and vegetables a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Just make sure to include some protein with your meals. How about we set a goal to review your progress in a month?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that sound good. I will try my best.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent! Remember, consistency is key. Do you feel ready to start?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I am ready. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Let's meet again in a month to see how you're doing. Take care!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, see you next time! Bye-bye!
