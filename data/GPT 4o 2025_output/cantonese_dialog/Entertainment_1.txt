**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, do you have any plans for this evening?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, not yet. I think maybe go out for dinner. You have idea?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about trying that new Italian restaurant downtown? I've heard good things about it.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, Italian food! I like pasta. But, um, is it expensive?

**Speaker A (NS):** It's reasonably priced, I think. They have a variety of dishes, so we can choose something within our budget.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, that sound good. What time you want to meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 7 p.m.? Is that okay for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, 7 p.m. is good. After dinner, maybe we can do something else?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! We could go for a walk by the river or maybe catch a movie. What do you prefer?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I think walk is nice. Weather is good today, not too hot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! A walk sounds relaxing. Do you want to meet at the restaurant or somewhere else?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think meet at restaurant is better. Easier for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, I'll see you there at 7 p.m. then. Looking forward to it!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, me too! Thank you for plan. I will see you later.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Mei. Have a great afternoon, and see you tonight!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, see you tonight! Bye-bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
