**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, hello. I am looking for... how to say... a thing for cooking rice.

**Speaker A (NS):** A rice cooker?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, rice cooker! I need one for my home.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, we have a few options. Do you have a specific size or brand in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I not sure. Maybe... medium size? For family, um, four people.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. We have this model here, which is perfect for a family of four. It’s easy to use and has a timer.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Timer is good! I like it. How much is this one?

**Speaker A (NS):** This one is $50. It’s a good deal for the features it offers.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, okay. Is there... um, cheaper one?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we have a smaller model for $30, but it doesn’t have a timer.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think... I take the one with timer. It is better for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! Would you like any other kitchen appliances today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, just rice cooker. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Let me know if you need anything else.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** My pleasure. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! Goodbye!
