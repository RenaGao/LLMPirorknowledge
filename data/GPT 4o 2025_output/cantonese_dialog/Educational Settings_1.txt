**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Mei! Are you ready for the big test next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, hello! I am... a bit nervous. The test is, uh, very important, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it is. But don't worry, we can prepare together. Have you started studying yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I start a little bit. I read the book, but some part is hard to understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Which parts are you finding difficult? Maybe I can help explain.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, thank you! The, um, chapter about... how to say... statistics? It is confusing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Statistics can be tricky. Have you tried using any online resources or videos?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I watch some video. It help, but still not clear. Maybe I need more practice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Practice is a good idea. We could do some practice questions together if you want.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** That is good! I think practice with you will help me understand better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We can meet at the library tomorrow. What time works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, maybe... 3 p.m.? Is that okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** 3 p.m. is perfect. We can go over the questions and discuss any problems.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, thank you! I feel better now. You are very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to help. We can do this together. Do you have any other study tips?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think... um, making notes is good. I write down important thing.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great tip. Writing notes can really help with memory.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, and maybe... um, take break? Not study too long.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, taking breaks is important to stay fresh. Let's remember that.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I will remember. Thank you again!
