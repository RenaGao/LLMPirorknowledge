**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, thanks for meeting up. I heard you wanted to discuss something challenging from our class?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, hello! Um, I want to talk about... how to say... the big topic in biology. Evolution?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, evolution. Sure, what part of it are you finding difficult?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I not understand... um, natural selection. It is... how animals change, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly. Natural selection is about how traits that help survival become more common in a population over time.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I see. So, like... if animal have good trait, it... um, survive more?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right! Those animals are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on the beneficial traits.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, okay. And... um, what about... mutation? Is it same?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. Mutations are changes in DNA that can introduce new traits. Some are helpful, some are not.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I understand now. So, mutation can be... um, good or bad for animal?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. If a mutation is beneficial, it might help with natural selection.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you. This help a lot. I need to... um, read more about examples.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, examples can really help. Do you want to go over some together next time?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that would be good. I will prepare some questions.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Just let me know when you're ready. Anything else you need help with today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I think this is good for now. Thank you for explain.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Mei. I'm glad I could help. See you in class!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, see you in class! Bye!
