**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I heard we're planning a birthday surprise for Alex. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, um, I think maybe we can do... how to say... a party at home?

**Speaker A (NS):** A house party sounds fun! Do you think we should have a theme?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Theme, yes! Maybe, um, like... movie night? Alex like movies a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea! We could set up a projector and watch some of Alex's favorite films. What about food?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Food, yes. We can order pizza and, um, make some snacks. Maybe popcorn for movie?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Pizza and popcorn are always a hit. Do you think we should invite a lot of people or keep it small?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think small is better. Alex like... um, close friends more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed, a small group will make it more personal. What about decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Decorations, um, maybe balloons and... how to say... streamers?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, balloons and streamers would be nice. Do you want to handle the decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I can do that. I will buy them and, um, set up before party.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'll take care of the food and drinks. Should we plan any games or activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Games, yes. Maybe, um, board games or... karaoke? Alex like singing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Karaoke sounds like a lot of fun! I'm sure Alex will love it. What time should we start the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe, um, 7 p.m.? Is that okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** 7 p.m. works perfectly. Let's meet a bit earlier to set everything up.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, good idea. I will come at 6 p.m. to help.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! I think we have a solid plan. Thanks for your help, Mei.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No problem! I am happy to help. See you on the party day!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! It's going to be a great surprise for Alex.
