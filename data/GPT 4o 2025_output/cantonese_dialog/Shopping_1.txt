**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you looking to buy something today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, um, I want to buy... how to say... a bag. For my sister.

**Speaker A (NS):** A bag for your sister? Great! Do you have a specific type in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. I think... um, leather bag. She like leather.

**Speaker A (NS):** Leather bags are nice. Do you have a budget for it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Budget... um, I think maybe... not too expensive. Around fifty dollar?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's see what we can find. Here's a nice leather bag. It's priced at sixty dollars. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sixty... um, a bit high. Can we... how to say... make lower price?

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean negotiate? Sure, we can try. How about fifty-five dollars?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Fifty-five... um, still high. Maybe fifty-two dollar?

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I think we can agree on fifty-two dollars. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, fifty-two is good. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Is there anything else you need today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, just the bag. I think my sister will like it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure she will. Do you need a bag for it, or are you okay carrying it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I carry it. No need bag. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, here you go. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! You too. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Enjoy your shopping!
