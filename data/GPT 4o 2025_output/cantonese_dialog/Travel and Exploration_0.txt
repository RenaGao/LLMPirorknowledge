**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, are you excited about our trip to the new city this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, very excited! Um, I think it will be fun. We go with many friends, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, there will be about six of us. Have you thought about what you want to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I want to see... um, how to say... the big building? Like, famous one.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean the landmark or skyscraper?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, landmark! And maybe we can try local food. I hear it is very good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely, trying local food is a must. Do you have any specific dishes in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I not sure the name. Maybe something spicy? I like spicy food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! We can ask locals for recommendations. How about transportation? Do you know how we’ll get around?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think we use... um, public bus? Or maybe train. It is easy, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, public transport is usually convenient. We can also use maps on our phones to help.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Good idea. I will download map app. And, um, what time we meet on Saturday?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 9 a.m.? That way we have the whole day to explore.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** 9 a.m. is good. Not too early, not too late.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Do you need help with packing or anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think I am okay. Just need to remember... um, camera for photos.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, don’t forget your camera! It’ll be great to capture memories.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will take many photos. Thank you for help with plan.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Mei. I’m looking forward to it. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you Saturday! Bye-bye!
