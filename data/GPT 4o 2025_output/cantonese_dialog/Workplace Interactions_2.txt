**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, thanks for joining the call. Are you ready to plan our team meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I am ready. Um, what we need to talk about in meeting?

**Speaker A (NS):** We should discuss the project updates and set goals for next month. Do you have any other topics in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, let me think... maybe we can talk about, um, team building activity? It is good for, uh, team spirit.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea! Team building can really help. Do you have any activities in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, maybe we can do, uh, cooking class? It is fun and everyone can join.

**Speaker A (NS):** A cooking class sounds fun! I'll add that to the agenda. What about the timing? When should we have the meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** How about, um, Friday afternoon? Is it okay for everyone?

**Speaker A (NS):** Friday afternoon works for me. I'll check with the rest of the team. Anything else we should include?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, maybe we need to talk about, uh, budget for next project?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, discussing the budget is important. I'll make sure it's on the agenda. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I think that is all. We have project update, team building, and budget.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I'll send out the agenda and confirm the time with everyone. Thanks for your input, Mei.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you too. I hope meeting will be, um, successful.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure it will be. Let's catch up again soon. Have a great day!
