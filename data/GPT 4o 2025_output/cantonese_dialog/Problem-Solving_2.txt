**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, I wanted to talk to you about the report. I noticed there was a small mistake in the data. 

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, um, I sorry about that. I think I make mistake with numbers.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, it happens. Do you know which part needs fixing?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think it is in, uh, the sales figures for last month. I can check again.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good. Do you need any help with it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe, um, I can fix it first. If still problem, I ask you, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, that works. Just let me know if you need anything.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you. I will check and, um, send you update by tomorrow.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I appreciate you taking care of it so quickly.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No problem. I want to make it right.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great attitude. Is there anything else you want to discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, no, I think that is all for now. Thank you for understanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, Mei. We all make mistakes. It's how we fix them that counts.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I agree. I will do my best.

**Speaker A (NS):** I know you will. Let's catch up again soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, let's do that. Thank you again.
