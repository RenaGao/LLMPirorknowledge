**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello! Nice to meet you too. Um, I like... how to say... drawing and painting. You know, art.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that's wonderful! I love art too. Do you have a favorite style or artist?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like... um, Impressionism. Like Monet. His painting very beautiful, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, Monet's work is stunning. Have you ever visited an art museum to see his paintings?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I go to museum in Hong Kong. They have some... um, exhibition. Very nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! I visited an exhibition once in Paris. It was unforgettable. Do you also create your own art?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I try. I paint... um, landscape and sometimes people. Not very good, but I enjoy.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Art is all about expression. Do you have any other interests besides art?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like cooking. Um, I make Cantonese food. You know, dim sum and... um, noodles.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yum, I love dim sum! Do you have a favorite dish to cook?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like to make... um, char siu bao. It is... how to say... barbecue pork bun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Delicious! I’ve tried making those before, but they didn’t turn out as good as in restaurants. Any tips?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, practice is important. And good sauce. Um, sweet and salty balance.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tip! It's been great talking about our interests.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I enjoy too. Thank you for sharing. Maybe we can talk more next time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! I’d love that. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! Goodbye!
