**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, I was curious about something. Could you tell me about your favorite holiday in Hong Kong?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, sure! Um, my favorite holiday is Mid-Autumn Festival. It is very... how to say... special for family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! What do you usually do during the Mid-Autumn Festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We, um, we eat mooncake and... uh, watch the moon. It is... um, tradition.

**Speaker A (NS):** Mooncakes sound delicious! Do you have any other activities during the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we also... um, carry lanterns. Children like it very much. It is... colorful and bright.

**Speaker A (NS):** That must be beautiful to see! Do you celebrate with your family?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, with family. We have dinner together. It is... um, important time for us.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine. Is there a special dish you enjoy during the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we eat... um, taro and pomelo. It is... how to say... lucky food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Lucky food, interesting! Do you have any favorite memories from past festivals?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes, when I was child, I make lantern with my father. It was... very fun and happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful memory. Do you still make lanterns now?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Not much now, but sometimes with... um, my niece. She like it too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! It must be nice to share the tradition with her.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is nice. She enjoy very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for sharing, Mei. I learned a lot about the Mid-Autumn Festival!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You are welcome! I happy to share.

**Speaker A (NS):** Let's catch up again soon. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, see you soon! Have good day too!
