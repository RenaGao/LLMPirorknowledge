**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei! How's your morning routine these days?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, hello! My morning, um, is busy. I wake up at seven o'clock.

**Speaker A (NS):** Seven o'clock, that's early! What do you do first?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** First, I, um, brush teeth and wash face. Then I make breakfast.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! What do you usually have for breakfast?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I eat, um, bread and drink tea. Sometimes, I have congee. You know congee?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I know congee! It's delicious. Do you have time to relax in the morning?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, not much time. I need to go work. I take bus, so I leave home at eight.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you listen to music or read on the bus?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I listen music. It help me relax before work.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a nice way to start the day. Do you have a favorite song?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I like many songs. Um, I like pop music. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I enjoy pop music too! It really lifts the mood. Do you have any morning exercise?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Exercise, um, not in morning. I do after work. I go gym sometimes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! It's important to stay active. Do you find it helps with stress?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, very much. Exercise make me feel, um, better and more energy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, it does wonders. Well, it sounds like you have a good routine.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I try my best. And you, how is your morning?

**Speaker A (NS):** Mine is quite similar, but I usually go for a quick jog. It wakes me up.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Jogging is good! Maybe I try in future. 

**Speaker A (NS):** You should! It's refreshing. Anyway, it was nice chatting about our routines.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, nice talk! Thank you for sharing. See you next time!
