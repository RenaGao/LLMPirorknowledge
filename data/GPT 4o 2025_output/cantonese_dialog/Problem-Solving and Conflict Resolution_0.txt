**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, I heard you were upset about something I said last week. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, um... I think maybe I misunderstand. You say something about my project, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I mentioned your project. I was really impressed by it. Did it sound different to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think you say it not good enough. But maybe I hear wrong?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh no, I definitely didn't mean that! I actually thought it was very creative. I'm sorry if it came across differently.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I see. Maybe my English not so good. I sometimes confuse words.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay, Mei. Communication can be tricky. I'm glad we're clearing this up.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I feel better now. Thank you for explain.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! If there's ever anything unclear, just let me know. Iâ€™m here to help.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I will. I want to improve my English more.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're doing great! Practice makes perfect. Do you want to grab coffee sometime and chat more?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like that. We can talk more about project too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. How about this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, Saturday is good. What time you free?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** 2 p.m. is good. I will see you then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Looking forward to it. Thanks for talking today, Mei.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you too. I feel much better. See you Saturday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you Saturday! Take care until then.
