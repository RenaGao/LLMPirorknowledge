**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I heard you love cooking. Can you tell me how you prepare your favorite meal?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes! I like to cook... um, how to say... chicken rice. It is very, um, popular in Hong Kong.

**Speaker A (NS):** Chicken rice sounds delicious! How do you start?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** First, I wash the rice. Then, I put in rice cooker with water. Um, I think... two cup water for one cup rice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. And what about the chicken?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, chicken. I use... um, ginger and garlic. I put in pot with chicken. Boil... um, boil until cooked.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds simple and tasty! Do you add any sauce?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! I make sauce with soy sauce, sesame oil, and... um, sugar. Mix together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great combination. Do you serve it with anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like to have... um, cucumber. It is fresh and... um, crunchy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice touch! How long does it take to prepare everything?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe... um, one hour? Yes, one hour is enough.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's pretty quick! Do you have any tips for making it extra special?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I think... use fresh chicken. And, um, more ginger for... how to say... flavor?

**Speaker A (NS):** Fresh ingredients always make a difference. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You are welcome! I hope you try it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I definitely will. It sounds amazing. Thanks again!
