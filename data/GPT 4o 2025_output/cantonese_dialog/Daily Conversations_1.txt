**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, hello! I think... maybe go to beach. Weather is very nice now.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! What do you plan to do at the beach?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I want to swim and, uh, how to say... sunbathe? And eat some food there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Do you have a favorite beach snack?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like... um, chips and fruit. Easy to bring.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choices! Who are you going with?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I go with my friend, Wing. She just buy new swimsuit.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that's exciting! What time are you planning to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We think... maybe 10 a.m. Is it too early?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not at all, 10 a.m. is a good time. It’s cooler in the morning.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, cooler is good. We can enjoy more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Do you need to prepare anything special for the trip?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, just bring towel, sunscreen, and... how to say... umbrella?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, an umbrella is a good idea for shade.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, shade is important. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I hope you have a fantastic time at the beach.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I will tell you about it after.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to hear about it. Have a great weekend, Mei!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! Bye-bye!
