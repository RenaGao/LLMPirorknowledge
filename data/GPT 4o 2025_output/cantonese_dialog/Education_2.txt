**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, how can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, hello! I have question about homework. It is, uh, not clear for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, what part of the homework do you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** The part with, um, the essay. I not sure what topic to choose.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. The essay is about your favorite book. Do you have a book in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think about "Harry Potter." But, um, how to say... I not know how to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great choice! You can start by explaining why you like it. Maybe talk about the characters or the story.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, okay. I can say I like Harry because he is brave. Is that good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's a good start. You can also mention a specific scene that shows his bravery.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, I remember. The part with, um, the dragon. I write about that.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And don't forget to include your own thoughts and feelings about the book.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I will try. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Do you have any other questions about the assignment?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, no more question. I think I understand now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! If you need more help, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Mei. Good luck with your essay!
