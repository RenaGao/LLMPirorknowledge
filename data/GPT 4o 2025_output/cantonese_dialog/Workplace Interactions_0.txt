**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, do you have a moment to discuss our project deadlines?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I have time. Um, what we need to talk about?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We need to finalize the timeline for the new marketing campaign. Do you remember the deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. I think it is... um, next Friday? Is that right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Close! It's actually due next Wednesday. Do you think we can finish everything by then?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, Wednesday. Um, I think we can. But maybe need more time for... how to say... checking?

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean reviewing the materials?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, reviewing. We need check all details, make sure no mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, that's important. How about we aim to complete the draft by Monday, so we have two days for review?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that is good plan. Monday draft, then review.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. What tasks do you have left to complete?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I need finish... um, the design part. And also, write some content.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Do you need any help with the content writing?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe a little help. I not sure about some words, how to make it... um, more professional?

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, I can help with that. Let's meet tomorrow to go over it together.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! That will be very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. Is there anything else you want to discuss?
