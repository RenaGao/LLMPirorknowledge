**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, hello. I want to, uh, return a product I buy last week.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. Do you have the receipt with you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I have. Here it is. I buy this, um, how to say... blender?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, a blender. Is there something wrong with it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It not work well. The, um, blade not turn fast.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. We can definitely look into that. Our return policy allows returns within 30 days. Did you use it much?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I use only two times. It just not, um, blend good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, since it's within the return period, we can process a refund or exchange. Which would you prefer?

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Iâ€™ll start the refund process for you. It should take a few days to reflect in your account.
