**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, it's great to see you! I was wondering, have you noticed any differences in dining etiquette between here and back home?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, hello! Yes, I see some difference. Um, in Hong Kong, we use chopsticks a lot. Here, more fork and knife, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's true! We do use forks and knives more often. How about the way people eat? Is it different?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, a bit. In Hong Kong, we share food. Like, many dish in middle, and everyone take some. Here, more... um, individual plate?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, we usually have our own plates. Do you find it challenging to adjust to that?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sometimes, yes. I like sharing food. It feel more... um, together? But I learn to enjoy both way.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great perspective! Are there any specific table manners that are different?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, yes. In Hong Kong, we don't stick chopsticks in rice. It is... um, not polite. Here, I see people do it sometimes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I didn't know that! Thanks for sharing. Is there anything else you find interesting?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, the tipping. In Hong Kong, not so common. But here, you tip after meal, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, tipping is quite common here. It’s usually around 15-20% of the bill. Does that seem strange to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** A little, but I understand now. It is for good service, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, it's a way to show appreciation for the service. Have you tried any new foods here that you like?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I try... um, how to say... burger? I like it very much!

**Speaker A (NS):** Burgers are a classic! I'm glad you enjoyed it. Is there a dish from Hong Kong you think I should try?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, you should try dim sum! It is many small dish, very delicious.

**Speaker A (NS):** I love dim sum! It's such a fun way to try different foods. Thanks for the recommendation.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You're welcome! I happy to share. Maybe we can eat together sometime?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! Let’s plan for it soon. It was great talking with you, Mei.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, thank you! I enjoy our talk. See you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you soon, Mei! Take care.
