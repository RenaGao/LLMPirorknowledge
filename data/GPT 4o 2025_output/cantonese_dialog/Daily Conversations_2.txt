**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can you tell me about a recent memorable event in your life?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes, sure. Last month, I go to... how to say... a big family gathering.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, a family reunion?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, family reunion! It was very special for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful. What made it so special?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I see my cousin... um, we not meet for long time. Maybe five year?

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, five years is a long time. How did it feel to see them again?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It feel... um, very happy and warm. We talk a lot and eat many food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. What kind of food did you have?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We have... um, traditional food. Like, roast duck and... um, dim sum.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yum, that sounds delicious! Did you do anything else at the reunion?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we play game. Um, how to say... board game?

**Speaker A (NS):** Board games, yes. Which one did you play?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We play... um, Monopoly. It was very fun, but long!

**Speaker A (NS):** Monopoly can take a while! Did you win?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I not win. But it okay, I enjoy with family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's the most important part, enjoying time with family. How did the event make you feel overall?
