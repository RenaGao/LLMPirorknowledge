**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I heard you wanted to plan a group vacation. Do you have any ideas for the destination?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, um, I think maybe we go to beach? The weather is very nice now.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great idea! Which beach are you thinking of?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, I not sure... maybe the one with, um, big waves? Good for swim and, uh, surf?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you mean the one at Sunny Bay? It's popular for surfing.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, Sunny Bay! That is the name. I think it is good place.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! What activities do you want to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We can swim, and also, um, how to say... make food outside?

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean a barbecue?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, barbecue! And maybe we can play games on sand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds fun! How many people are you thinking of inviting?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Maybe ten people? I will ask my friends if they can come.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good number. When are you planning to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think next weekend is good. Is it okay for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Next weekend works for me. Should we meet to discuss the details?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we can meet. Um, maybe Friday after work?

**Speaker A (NS):** Friday sounds perfect. Let's finalize everything then.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, thank you! I will see you Friday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Looking forward to it. See you on Friday!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, see you Friday! Bye-bye!
