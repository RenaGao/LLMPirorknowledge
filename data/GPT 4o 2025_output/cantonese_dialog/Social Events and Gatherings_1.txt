**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, thanks for meeting up! I heard you want to plan a surprise party for Alex. How's it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi! Yes, I want to plan. Um, it is a bit... how to say... difficult?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Planning can be tricky. Do you have a date in mind for the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think maybe next Saturday. Is it good time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Next Saturday sounds perfect. Have you thought about where to have it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think maybe at my home. It is... um, more easy to prepare.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea. How many people are you planning to invite?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I want to invite... um, about ten people. Is it too many?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten people is a nice number. It keeps it cozy. What about food and drinks?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. I think I will cook some... um, simple dishes. Maybe noodles and... how to say... dumplings?

**Speaker A (NS):** Noodles and dumplings sound delicious! Do you need help with anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, maybe help with decoration? I not so good at it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with decorations. We can keep it simple but festive. Do you have a theme in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Theme... um, maybe just colorful? Alex like bright color.

**Speaker A (NS):** Colorful is a fun theme! We can get some balloons and streamers. Anything else you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think... um, music. Alex like music very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! We can make a playlist of Alex's favorite songs. 

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that is good. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, happy to help! Let's meet again to finalize everything. How about Thursday?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thursday is good. We can talk more then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Looking forward to it. Bye for now!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bye! See you Thursday!
