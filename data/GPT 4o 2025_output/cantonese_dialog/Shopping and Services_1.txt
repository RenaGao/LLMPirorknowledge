**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Mei, I heard you're thinking about buying a new phone. Do you need any help deciding?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, I want to buy new phone. Um, I not sure which one is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! What features are you looking for in a phone?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I want good camera, and... um, battery long time. Also, easy to use.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Do you have a specific brand in mind, or are you open to suggestions?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like Apple, but maybe Samsung also okay. What you think?

**Speaker A (NS):** Both are great choices. Apple has a user-friendly interface, and Samsung often has excellent battery life. Do you take a lot of photos?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I take many photo. I like to capture... um, how to say... beautiful moment.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, beautiful moments. In that case, both brands have models with excellent cameras. Do you have a budget in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think... um, not too expensive. Maybe around $800?

**Speaker A (NS):** Thatâ€™s a reasonable budget. You can find good options within that range. Have you checked any models online?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I see some online, but too many choice. I feel... um, confused.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Maybe you can list the top three features you need, and we can narrow it down from there.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, um, camera, battery, and... how to say... fast speed?

**Speaker A (NS):** Speed, like performance speed? That makes sense. I think the latest models from both brands would suit you well.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you. I will look more and decide. You help me a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Mei! Let me know if you need more advice. Good luck with your decision!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I will tell you when I buy. Bye-bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! Bye, Mei!
