**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Mei, I was thinking about our dinner plans. Have you noticed any differences in dining etiquette between here and back home?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, yes, there are some difference. Um, like in Hong Kong, we use chopsticks more. Here, many people use fork and knife.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's true. Do you find it difficult to switch between them?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sometimes, yes. But I learn to use fork and knife. It is, um, not too hard now.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! What about other customs, like at the table?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. In Hong Kong, we wait for elder to start eating. Here, it is more... um, casual?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it's often more relaxed here. Do you have any favorite dining customs from home?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like sharing dishes. We put food in middle, everyone take what they want. It feel more, um, together.

**Speaker A (NS):** I love that too! It makes meals feel more communal. Do you miss any specific foods?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I miss dim sum. It is hard to find same taste here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Dim sum is delicious! Have you found any good places here?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** A few, but not same. I try to make at home sometimes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's impressive! Cooking at home can be fun. Do you have any tips for making dim sum?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, use fresh ingredient. And, how to say... patience? It take time to make.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good advice! Patience is key. Thanks for sharing, Mei. It's always interesting to learn about different cultures.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you for listen. I enjoy talk about this.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Let's do this again sometime. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, see you next time! Have good day!
