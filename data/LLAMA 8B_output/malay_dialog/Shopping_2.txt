**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thank you for visiting our store. I'm Liam, and I'll be happy to help you with your concerns. What seems to be the issue today?

**Speaker B (L2):** Ah, thank you, Liam. My name is Aisyah, and I from... um, Malaysia. My... thing for buying here no good. I want to return it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sorry to hear that, Aisyah. I'd be happy to help you with the return process. Can you tell me more about the product that wasn't up to your expectations?

**Speaker B (L2):** Yes... the shirt I buy yesterday. It too big and I don't like design. Um, how to say... it not match with my picture.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So, the shirt was a good size when you bought it, but now it's too big, and you don't like the design? Did you purchase it yesterday?

**Speaker B (L2):** Yes, yesterday. Yesterday evening. And I check the size before, but maybe I choose wrong?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, no worries, Aisyah. Let me see what I can do. Can I just ask, did you receipt for the item?

**Speaker B (L2):** Oh, yeah... I have. Right here. (pauses to find receipt) Here, this one.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you, Aisyah. I see the receipt is for yesterday. So, you're all set to return the shirt. We'll give you a refund or an exchange, whichever you prefer.

**Speaker B (L2):** Thank you, Liam! I want exchange, maybe for smaller size or another design?

**Speaker A (NS):** I can give you a store credit for a different size or design. We also have a wide selection of shirts available.

**Speaker B (L2):** That sound good. Thank you, Liam. You very nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Aisyah. I'm glad I could help. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2):** No, thank you, Liam. Thank you very much!

**Speaker A (NS):** Have a great day, Aisyah. Safe travels!

**Speaker B (L2):** You, too! See you later! ( Ends the conversation by confirming the exchange while walking away from the store counter.) Have a good day, and I got good deal for return the shirt, yes!

**Speaker A (NS):** You all set. Good day, Aisyah! (Smiling and waving.)
