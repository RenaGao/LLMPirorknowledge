**Speaker A (NS):** That's fantastic. What motivated you to take on this challenge?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I want to prove to myself that I can do it. (pauses) Like previous year, I try to join but... um, korang yang leh sapu last stop, tapi saya tak sempat (laughs) ...my friend finish, but I didn't reach the last point.

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) I see. So this year, you pushed yourself to finish the entire marathon.
