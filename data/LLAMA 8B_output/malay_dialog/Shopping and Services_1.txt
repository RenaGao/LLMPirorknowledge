**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thanks for meeting me here. I've heard great things about this phone, but I wanted to discuss its features before purchasing it. Can you tell me more about the camera?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes. Camera good, many feature. Um, how you say... high-quality, sharp... hmm, "cermin" clear?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sharp and clear photos? That's great! What about the battery life? Does it have a long battery life?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, long lasting. Um, like... "aku ada banyak tenaga"? No, wait... "aku ada daya lama"?
