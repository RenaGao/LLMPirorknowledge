**Turn 1:**
**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, let's discuss a challenging topic we've been working on. How was your week studying for our exams?

**Turn 2:**
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, hello! My week, um, normal. I study for exam, but I struggle with algorithm.

**Turn 3:**
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, algorithms can be tough. Can you tell me a bit more about what you found challenging about them?

**Turn 4:**
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, you see... in algorithm, I get confuse with... um, how to say... loop and recursion?

**Turn 5:**
**Speaker A (NS):** Recursion and loops can be tricky. Let's break it down. What do you understand about loops so far?

**Turn 6:**
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I know loop... um, one time, one time, do this, do this, yeah?

**Turn 7:**
**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good start! Loops are similar, but instead of just repeating once, they can repeat many times. How do you think recursion fits into that?

**Turn 8:**
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, um... recursion like, a little loop inside other loop, yes?

**Turn 9:**
**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good analogy! Recursion is essentially calling a function within itself. But the key is to understand how to use it correctly.

**Turn 10:**
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Correct. So, recursion like... a shortcut, yes?

**Turn 11:**
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Recursion can be very helpful in reducing code complexity. Have you seen an example of recursion in action?

**Turn 12:**
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I see example in, uh, Python. Yeah, Python has recursion function.

**Turn 13:**
**Speaker A (NS):** Python is a great language for learning recursion. Would you like to try practicing some recursion exercises?

**Turn 14:**
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I would like to try. But first, um, can we talk more about problems we find in recursion?

**Turn 15:**
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! What kinds of problems have you found with recursion?

**Turn 16:**
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, um, I remember now. Recursion can cause... um, how to say... stack overflow, yeah?

**Turn 17:**
**Speaker A (NS):** That's right! One of the key issues with recursion is understanding how to avoid stack overflow and infinite loops.

**Turn 18:**
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I understand more now. Thank you for explaining.

**Turn 19:**
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, it was my pleasure to help clarify recursion for you. Let's make sure to practice the exercises from last class and our professor's tips will be useful too.

**Turn 20:**
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, thank you! We make big progress today, thanks to you! See you later, friend! Have a great weekend!
