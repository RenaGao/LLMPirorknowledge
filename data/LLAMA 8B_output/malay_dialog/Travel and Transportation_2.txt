**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Welcome! Today, we're going to plan a group vacation. Can you help me decide on a destination?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, yeap, I like traveling. Destination, yes... How do I say... a place with sunny… um, hot weather. I mean, beach! Yes, beach!

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the beach sounds great! For the beach, have you considered Bali in Indonesia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Bali? Ahh, yes, I know it. That sounds nice. What about... activities? We need, um, things to do there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Bali has a lot to offer. We can snorkel, dive, or simply relax on the beach. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Relax, yes, that sound good. But maybe we can also... um, do some water sports? Like... surfing? Old Kuta, it have big wave.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's exciting! Old Kuta is a great spot for surfing. We can also visit temples like Tanah Lot and Uluwatu.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Temple, yes! I like visiting temple. But what about, um, transportation? We need, how you say, a nice way to get there?

**Speaker A (NS):** We can take a taxi or rent a car with a driver. It'll be convenient and easy.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, good. We also need, um, a place to stay. Where we can, you know, rest.

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking of booking a hotel in Seminyak, it's central and has a good quality.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Seminyak, I know it! Nice location, yes.

**Speaker A (NS):** So, it seems we have a good plan starting to shape up. What about a summary – are you excited about our Bali trip?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, Aiman, I am! I molto enjoy conversation plan this trip. Jumpa nanti! (Let's meet [each other] again!)

**Speaker A (NS):** Great to hear, Farah! I'll send you the finalized plans. Sampai jumpa di Bali! (See you in Bali!)
