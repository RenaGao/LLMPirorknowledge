**Speaker A (NS):**
Hi, thank you for coming to see me about your assignment. Can you explain what’s not clear for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, thank you. I don’t understand... um, how to say... the thing for group project. I think I need more explanation.

**Speaker A (NS):**
Let's start again. Can you tell me specifically what you're having trouble with? Is it the task or the process?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, the task. I think we have to do presentation, but I'm not sure... how to say... the time for it.

**Speaker A (NS):**
Right, you're worried about the presentation timeline. Let me clarify: you need to submit the report first, then you and your group will present.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I see. Thank you. But what if we don't finish report on time? Will we still have chance to present?

**Speaker A (NS):**
Even if you don't finish the report on time, you'll still have the opportunity to present your work in a special follow-up session. 

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, thank you. That’s good to know. Can I ask one more question... how to say... about the presentation format?

**Speaker A (NS):**
Go ahead, ask your question.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yeah, I want to ask... um, how long should be our presentation? 10 minutes? 15 minutes?

**Speaker A (NS):**
The standard presentation time is 10 minutes, but since it's a group project, feel free to use 12-13 minutes at most.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, thank you. I think I understand now.

**Speaker A (NS):**
I'm glad we clarified the concerns. Do you feel more confident about the assignment now?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I do. Thank you for your help. I'll... um, do my best now.

**Speaker A (NS):**
That's the spirit! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask. Have a great day and good luck with the assignment.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**
You too, thank you. Bye... farewell. 

**Speaker A (NS):**
Bye for now, Kenta!
