**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Siti! I heard you're from Malaysia. What's a traditional festival that's close to your heart?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! I from Malaysia. Um, one festival we celebrate is... how to say... "Hari Raya Aidilfitri."

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! Hari Raya Aidilfitri is the Malay festival at the end of Ramadan, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes. After fasting month... um, 30 day.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right. I've heard it's a time for families to come together and mark the end of fasting.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we call it "balik rumah." People go back to their family houses.

**Speaker A (NS):** balik rumah? That means "home"?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, home. And we wear baju raya... you know, traditional clothes.

**Speaker A (NS):** How lovely! What about food? What traditional dishes are served during Hari Raya Aidilfitri?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, oh! We have nasi lemak, rendang... and... um, it's a type of traditional dessert, kuih.

**Speaker A (NS):** Kuih sounds interesting. I'd love to learn more about Malay culture.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It's a big part of our tradition. We also visit neighbors and give gifts, or "duit raya."

**Speaker A (NS):** Duit raya is a generous act, isn't it? Showcasing love and gratitude.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes! We say "Selamat Hari Raya" to wish each other.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's beautiful. Thank you, Siti, for sharing this with me. I feel like I've learned a lot!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You're welcome! It was nice to tell you about my culture. Maybe we talk again soon?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'd love that, Siti. Have a great day and Selamat Hari Raya to you!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Selamat Hari Raya! See you later!
