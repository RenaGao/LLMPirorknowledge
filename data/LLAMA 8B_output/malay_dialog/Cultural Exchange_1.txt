Let's talk about cultural differences in dining etiquette. What do you think is a significant difference between our cultures?

**Turn 2: Speaker B (L2, Malay)**
Ah, yeah! In my country, when we eat, we... um... with many people together, yes? Like, big family or friends.

**Turn 3: Speaker A (NS)**
That's a good point. In many Malay cultures, dining is a social occasion where everyone comes together to share food and company.

**Turn 4: Speaker B (L2, Malay)**
Yes! And, um, when we eat, we, you know, finish everything on plate. We don't, how to say... poke around for something to eat.

**Turn 5: Speaker A (NS)**
I see what you mean. In some Western cultures, it's common for people to leave a small amount of food on their plate to indicate they've had enough.

**Turn 6: Speaker B (L2, Malay)**
Hmm... In Malaysia, if you leave food, people think you didn't like it. So, we always, um, finish.

**Turn 7: Speaker A (NS)**
I can understand that. In many Asian cultures, it's a sign of respect to finish your food, especially if it was prepared by the host.

**Turn 8: Speaker B (L2, Malay)**
Yes... And another thing, in Malaysia, we don't, um, touch food with the left hand. We use right hand.

**Turn 9: Speaker A (NS)**
That's a good point. In many Islamic cultures, the left hand is considered unclean due to personal hygiene reasons.

**Turn 10: Speaker B (L2, Malay)**
Right! So, like when we, um, give and take food, we use right hand.

**Turn 11: Speaker A (NS)**
So, it's a rule of thumb to use the right hand in formal settings or when interacting with others in your culture.

**Turn 12: Speaker B (L2, Malay)**
Yes... And, um, when we finish meal, we, you know... hands clasped together... say, "Terima kasih!"

**Turn 13: Speaker A (NS)**
That's a great point. In many Malay cultures, using both hands together and saying "Terima kasih" (thank you) is a way of showing appreciation for a meal.

**Turn 14: Speaker B (L2, Malay)**
Terima kasih for teaching me, friend! I never know about that custom.

**Turn 15: Speaker A (NS)**
It was fun chatting with you about cultural differences. Let's do it again soon!

**Turn 16: Speaker B (L2, Malay)**
Yeah, thanks for chatting! I agree with you... we have many differences, but also, um... same human values?

**Turn 17: Speaker A (NS)**
Exactly! Despite our differences, we share common values like respect, gratitude, and kindness.

**Turn 18: Speaker B (L2, Malay)**
Sama... same. I, uh... say "Saya suka" for saying "Thanks for talking to me"!

**Turn 19: Speaker A (NS)**
You're welcome, Kenta! I had a great time chatting with you too.

**Turn 20: Speaker B (L2, Malay)**
Saya rasa kita sudah habis menghabiskan waktu kita ni! Goodbye, friend!
