**Native Speaker (NS):** Hi! I'm Alex. Welcome to the party. It's great to meet you. Can you tell me your name?

**Malay Speaker (L2):** Ah, thank you. My name is Rohan. I from Malaysia. I... um, how to say... I come here for work.

**NS:** Oh, nice to meet you, Rohan! What brings you here tonight?

**L2 (Rohan):** I learn about your... um, thing for networking.

**NS:** Ah, networking event. That's great. What do you do for work, Rohan?

**L2 (Rohan):** I am... uh, marketing officer for my company.

**NS:** That's interesting. What kind of products or services do you market?

**L2 (Rohan):** We have... um, Sobek shirt. It is good for sport.

**NS:** That sounds like a great product! I'll have to check it out. Do you live in Kuala Lumpur?

**L2 (Rohan):** Yes! I from Kuala Lumpur. But now I work in... uh, Singapore.

**NS:** Singapore's a great city. Do you like living there?

**L2 (Rohan):** Yes, my wife and I, we like it. But sometimes I feel... um, homesick, yes.

**NS:** That's understandable. It's great that you have your wife to support you.

**L2 (Rohan):** Yes! She very nice. Um, say thank you for talk with me, Alex.

**NS:** You're welcome, Rohan! It was great talking with you too. Maybe we can catch up again sometime. Time to say good night, I think.

**L2 (Rohan):** Baiklah, Alex! Sampai jumpa lagi. Good night, and see you again!

**NS:** Good night, Rohan! Until next time!
