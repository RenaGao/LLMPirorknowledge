**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aziz! What's up? I saw your post about meeting up on Saturday, but I thought we were meeting on Sunday.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! Sorry, I make mistake. I think I write wrong day. I meant Sunday, of course.
**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, it happens! So, are you still up for meeting on Sunday?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I am. But I think we should change time. I have... um, appointment... with my family in the morning.
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. How about we meet at 2 pm instead?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that's better. I can... um, how to say... finish my thing and come to you.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great, I'll make sure to reserve a table for us. Do you want to grab lunch together?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that's a good idea. I can... um, ask my family for money... or we can split the bill?
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! I'll bring my wallet, just in case.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, thank you. I also want to ask, um, how to say... can we go to park after lunch?
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! I love walking in the park. It's so peaceful.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I like it too. It's... um, good for exercise and fresh air.
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Okay, I think we've got everything sorted out. Shall we confirm the plans for Sunday?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that's a good idea. I confirm... um, yes.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'll see you on Sunday at 2 pm, then.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, see you then! Have a good day!
**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Aziz! Bye for now.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Bye!
