**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I see you here at the food court. What brings you here today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, thank you. I, um, meet friend here. We have misunderstanding yesterday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** He, um, think I, borrow something. But I no borrow! (laughs nervously) I say, I no need it.

**Speaker A (NS):** So, you two didn't communicate clearly. Can you tell me more about what happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes. We talk yesterday, and I say I no want it. But maybe he no listen. My friend is... (pauses) very straightforward.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. And how did you try to resolve the misunderstanding?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I try... um, explain later. But maybe my language not clear. What he think, I understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** I think I see what might have happened. Why don't we break it down together? What do you mean you didn't borrow anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think I say, "No, I no need your thing for fix paper." (smiling) Yes, that paper thingy!

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) Okay, I think we can clear things up now. So, your friend thought you borrowed a stapler, but you meant you didn't need it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes! I so sorry for misunderstanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** We all misunderstand each other sometimes. What's important is that you two can talk about it and move forward.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, thank you. I learn something today.

**Speaker A (NS):** And it seems like you two are making up now?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes! We hug and say sorry. All is good. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, that's great to hear. If you ever need help resolving misunderstandings, just remember, communication is key!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I remember. Communication is the... the key (laughs). Thank you, friend!
