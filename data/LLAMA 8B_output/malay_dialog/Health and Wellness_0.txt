**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for coming in today, Dr. Arafat. Can you describe how you've been feeling lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, doctor. Okay. Excuse me. Um, I have... uh, how to say... headache. Yes, headache. And my body, um... itchy.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. An itchy body can be quite uncomfortable. Can you tell me more about the headache? Is it a sharp pain or more of a dull ache?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmmm... yeah. Dull ache. And, um, sometime, my head, it feel heavy. Like, um... stone.

**Speaker A (NS):** A warm feeling, almost? Um, can you also describe any fever or chills you might have?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! Fever! Oh, sorry. Um, I have... uh, high fever. Sometimes, um... 38 degree, maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, that helps. And, just to confirm, you've had these symptoms for about how long?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, three days? Three days ago, I start feel... um, sick.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. And have you experienced any other concerning symptoms, such as digestive issues or shortness of breath?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, no... no other thing. Just... um, vomiting. But only... um, orange juice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Only orange juice? Interesting. Okay, let me just take some notes. Um, I want to give you a physical exam and then get some tests run. Sound okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes! Okay. Thank you, doctor. Umm... sorry, um... not very good English.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries at all, Arafat! We're in this together. Don't worry if you need to repeat something. And remember, if you ever have any questions or concerns, your family doctor is always here to help.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you, doctor. Very kind. I... um, will get some tests.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent. One more thing, before I start your physical exam, is there anything that you'd like to say to someone, maybe tell them something?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes... my wife. I tell her to... um, be nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, clear instructions! Well, I'm sure she'll take them to heart. Now, let's get you looked after and then we'll have a plan for your future.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank doctor. Very happy. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you, Arafat. Keep smiling, okay?
