**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Kenta, great to meet you! I hear you're good at bargaining.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, Kenta. *smiles*. I from city, where you can find lots of market, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's terrific! I have a friend in mind who is selling a product at the local market. What do you know about bargaining here?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** In my city, we have something called "ajaib" where we... how to say... try to pay less?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, okay! So it's like negotiation. That sounds like a valuable skill. We have a vase here that you might be interested in. We're looking to sell it for RM 150.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Mmm, this vase... look nice. RM 150 sound... um... too expensive to me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, how about we come down to RM 120?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm... I think, I can maybe... give 10 ringgit more? If you...?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds reasonable. Alright, we'll meet at RM 130. Would you be willing to seal the deal for that price?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes... I think. I will have RM 120 in my hand. *produces a crisp RM 130 note*

**Speaker A (NS):** *laughs* You're so confident! And, of course, we couldn't agree at RM 130, but this is a perfect compromise. Deal!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** So, we say "sukak" with each other and we are like... friends with each other!

**Speaker A (NS):** *chuckles* Correct! We indeed have a handshake agreement. How about we discuss this over dinner sometime?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, would be nice... but I just want to, um, call my friend from home to thank them for recommendation. *nods*

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. We'll definitely stay in touch. It's been a real pleasure, Kenta. Toodles!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** *smiling* Toodles to you. Bye for now.
