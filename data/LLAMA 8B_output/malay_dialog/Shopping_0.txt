**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I'm looking for a special type of coffee, have you seen it before?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! Um, coffee for hot drink. You mean the one with a big cup, yes?
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, yes! Something like that. It has a unique flavor, and I want to try it.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I think I know what you mean. You want the... uh, special coffee? We have it, ah, section three. Follow me, please.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thank you so much for showing me!

**Speaker A (NS):** Can you show me exactly where it is? I'm not sure I can find it.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Of course! We have, ah, lots of coffee here. Um, the special one, it in there... you wait one minute. (pauses)
**Speaker A (NS):** Take your time, I'm patient. Can you tell me what it's called so I can find it easily?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes! The one with the... how to say... colorful box?
**Speaker A (NS):** I think you might be referring to "Sunbeam Coffee". Is that correct?
