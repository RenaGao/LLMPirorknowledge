**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Fareha! Have you studied for the math exam yet?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, um, math exam. I try, but I forget many formula. *laughs*
**Speaker A (NS):** Don't worry, it's normal. What topics do you think you'll need to focus on?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um... I think algebra, geometry, and... how to say... measurement? *struggles to recall*
**Speaker A (NS):** Measurement? You mean like ratios and proportions?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes! You right! Ratios and proportion, I mean.
**Speaker A (NS):** *smiles* Okay, so let's make a study plan together. What if we spend Sunday reviewing together?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Betul! *nervously laughs* Sounds good.
**Speaker A (NS):** How about we meet here at the library at 10 am?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yah, that possible. Library open at 10, right?
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it does. I'll bring my notes and textbooks. You bring your... your study guide?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** University... uh, my university notes, yes!
**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! Don't forget to also get some coffee and...
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):**... our favorite snack! *relieved* Mmm, sweet potato fries.
**Speaker A (NS):** *laughs* Alright, I'll see you Sunday.

**Final Expression of Agreement and Parting**
 
Speaker A: Well, I'll see you soon!

-- YES! Good luck at our exam!

 Speaker A: TERIMA KASIH (Thank you) until Sunday. Have a great day!
