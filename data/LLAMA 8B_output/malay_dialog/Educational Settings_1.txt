**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Amira! How's it going? Have you studied for the exam yet?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Amira, L2, Malay):** Hi, thanks. Um, I study a bit. But I still have many... um, thing to learn.

**Speaker A (NS):** Don't worry, it's just around the corner. What are you finding the most challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, the math part. I have trouble... how to say... remember formula.

**Speaker A (NS):** It can be tough. Did you review the formula sheet I gave you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes. I look at it. But I think I need more... um, practice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. We can practice together before the test. Maybe we can make a list of key points to focus on.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That's good idea. I prepare my own summary, but maybe your way... um, more clear.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. What about time management during the test? Have you thought about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, not really... I usually do this thing for me, not for exam situation.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. Well, for exams, it's better to manage your time carefully. You can divide the section into parts, say, 30 minutes each.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That sound like good... um, strategy.

**Speaker A (NS):** And don't forget to read the questions carefully before you start answering.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I will... um, remember.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, that's it for now. Let's summarize: review the formula, make a key-point list, and practice time management.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Setuju! That's it, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. We'll do this again right before the test, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Bolehlah! Okay. See you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, Amira! Take care!
