Here is a complete conversation for planning a trip to a new city with a group of friends:

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there, I'm really excited to plan this trip to a new city with you and our friends. What's the destination you have in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yeah! Um... I think we should go to... to the city that have nice beach, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, a beach city sounds great! I'm thinking maybe Singapore or Bali? Have you thought about which time of year is best to visit?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yeah, um, balik lah makin mulanyut! (Balik lah makin tupai!)

**Speaker A (NS):** Um, sorry, I didn't quite catch that. What did you mean?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, sorry! I meant, maybe we should go in the semester break, you know, when most people not working?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea! We can check the weather and plan accordingly. What about accommodations? Should we book a hotel or apartments?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I think we can... um, share hostel, like itu lah, guesthouse?!

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, sharing a hostel sounds like a great option. Have you thought about the itinerary for the trip? We want to make sure we fit in plenty of activities.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yeah, sure! Um, I think we can visit Universal Studios, Singapore. And maybe, er... Meromang Bogmongcorreo?!

**Speaker A (NS):** Um, I think you mean Marina Bay Sands? We can visit the skydeck there!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes, like that! We travel then!

**Speaker A (NS):** So we're both excited about the trip! Let's finalize some details and send out invitations.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sounds good! Let's plan for just me, you, and the three friends who said coming down with us?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! This is going to be an awesome trip. Shall we plan another time to finalize the plans?
