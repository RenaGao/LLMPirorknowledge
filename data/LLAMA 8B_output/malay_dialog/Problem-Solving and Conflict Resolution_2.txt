**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nurul. I heard there are some issues with the office printer. Can you tell me more about what's happening?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, mm... printer thing no work. We need... um, printer support.

**Speaker A (NS):** Printer support? Do you think it needs to be replaced or just repaired?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um... how to say... we try to fix yes. But... computer problem. Your computer link... no connect to printer?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see! So it's an issue with the computer and printer connectivity. Let me check the computer ports.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, check ports. Or we can try another printer? My professor have... uh, another printer for student.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good idea, Nurul. We can try an alternative printer. Do you think it's something we should talk about during our Monday team meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, Monday team meeting. Good... um, time to talk about printer. Maybe, we can ask IT. They help us fix problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let's add that to the agenda. I'll send you a reminder and we can discuss the details then.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Good idea. Thank you, speak to you tomorrow.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Nurul. See you then, and let's hope we can resolve the printer issue.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I see... printer fixed tomorrow. Jum, kap kami! (just kidding)

**Speaker A (NS):** Ha ha! That sounds great, Nurul. We'll meet later today and say plan summary. We will say, 'We are going to check and fix printer issues with IT assistance.'

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, jum, beritahu kami tomorrow! (Scroll send reminders for tomorrow) 

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, sounds perfect. Take care, Nurul!
