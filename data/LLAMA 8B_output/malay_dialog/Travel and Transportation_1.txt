**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Excuse me, can you help me find my way to the hotel? I'm a bit lost in this town.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, sorry! Um, yes, of course. You are looking for hotel? Hotel... (pauses for a moment) I think there is hotel near here. I can show you way.
**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you so much! That would be a big help. How do we get there from here?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We go straight... (points) and turn left. Okay? Um... big building, we will see. You can't miss it.
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, got it! I think we have to walk just a few minutes then.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes! Not far. It is... how to say... fourth building on left.
**Speaker A (NS):** Don't worry if it sounds confusing, we can just follow the map. Do you know what the hotel is called?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um... I think... (pauses) Ah, yes! Hotel... uh, Renaissance?
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds right! I'll just check the map real quick to confirm.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Wait, I look... (pauses, studies the map) Okay, yes. We got it!
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So the next left, down that street, and then the Renaissance Hotel will be on the right.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):)** Yes! Exactly! Next left, Renaissance Hotel.
**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful. Oh, I think we have time for one more question. Do you know if there's a scenic spot around here that we could take some quick photos?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um... I know place for photo. Near here. Over river? (gestures generally)
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! We'll head over towards the river then.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):)** Yes! River. Beautiful view. I go there with friends last week.
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect! We'll make sure to visit the river and then head back to the hotel. Thank you so much for your help!
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):)** No problem, happy to help! Safe trip! Sayonara!
**Speaker A (NS):)** You too! Take care! Goodbye.
**Speaker A (NS):** I think we're all set then! Have a great day!
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):)** You too! (gives a slight bow) Goodbye!
