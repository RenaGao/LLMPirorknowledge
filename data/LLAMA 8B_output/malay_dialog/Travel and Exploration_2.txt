**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, can I ask for directions to the city museum? I'm a bit lost here.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, yes, museum. Um, how to get go there? You take bus, but I forget number. Hmm...
**Speaker A (NS):** It's okay, take your time. Do you mind if I ask where you're from originally?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I'm from Petaling Jaya. But I learning... studying here for six months. My name Ah Meng. Nice to meet you.
**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you too, Ah Meng. So, about the museum, if I take the bus from here, will I need to transfer?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Transfer? Ah, yes... I think you say... um, change. You take bus one, then change to bus three. Then, very easy, you go straight to museum.
**Speaker A (NS):** Got it, thanks for the help. Now, let me recap: I take bus one, change to bus three, and then go straight to the museum, right?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, yes, that's right! Am I correct, Miss...?
**Speaker A (NS):** Just call me Sarah. Nice to meet you, Ah Meng. Thanks for your help today.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You're welcome, Sarah. Nice to meet you too. Take care, good day.
**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Ah Meng. Off I go to the museum!
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** God bless, Sarah. Have nice time there!

**Turn 18 (Native Speaker):** Bye for now!

**Turn 19 (L2 Speaker):** Bye, Sarah! Maybe we see each other again in Petaling Jaya?

**Turn 20 (Native Speaker):** That would be lovely, Ah Meng! Until then, have a wonderful day!
