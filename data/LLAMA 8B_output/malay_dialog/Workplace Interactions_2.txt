**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, so we're planning a team meeting for this week. Have you thought about the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! My friend, Nadi, she have idea. We can, uh, discuss about sales target for quarter.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great topic. Can you explain why you chose that?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, because our sales are... um, not good now. We need to, uh, make plan to increase.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I see. And do you think we should invite any guests to the meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, probably not. Only our team need to come. Maybe our manager, Pak Amir.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, that's a good point. How about we also discuss progress on our newest project?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! That thing for creative team. How to say... graphic design software.
