**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, glad we're cooking up a storm together! I've been noticing you're an awesome cook, but I was wondering, can you walk me through how you prepare your favorite dish?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, hello! Thank you, I very happy to teach. My favorite meal is Nasi Lemak, you know it? A popular dish in... um, how to say... my home country.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! I've tried it before and it's absolutely delicious. Go on, explain how you cook it.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** First, you cook rice. You need, uh, one cup of... thing for coconut... coconut thing... (giggles).

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) You're looking for the coconut milk!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes! You're very clever. Um... then add two cups water. And let it cook till the rice soften. After, I fry with um... pandan leaves for the smell!

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fantastic! Can you tell me what else is in the Nasi Lemak besides the fried item?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Fried chicken... thing. How to say, when you coat it with special flour. Chicken marinate then you fry, ah!

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, an interesting twist. It's clear that you use Malay spices! So, I'd like to confirm, does this dish use spices like gula melaka (palm sugar) at all?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, absolutely! Gula melaka sweet! You always have it to go with it! (both chuckle) Good combination yes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Beautiful, thank you so much, Azizah for sharing. How do we want to go with this yummy food?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Easy! It must be the, uh... with the many fried chicken you cooked. Enjoy your meal always with me today.
