**Speaker A (NS):** Fiction is great. Let me recommend a book I think you might enjoy. Have you ever heard of "Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls"?
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I don't know. Um, what is story about?
**Speaker A (NS):** It's a collection of short stories about women who made a difference in the world. Each story is accompanied by a beautiful illustration.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, sound nice. Why you think I like?
**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I think it's a great way to learn about different cultures and roles that women play in society. The stories are inspiring and the illustrations are stunning.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Wow, I like that. But, um, what if I no understand illustration?
**Speaker A (NS):** Don't worry, the stories are written in simple language and you can always look up the definitions of any words you're not familiar with.
**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, thank you. You think I must read?
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! I think you'll find it really engaging and it might even inspire you to make a positive change in the world.
