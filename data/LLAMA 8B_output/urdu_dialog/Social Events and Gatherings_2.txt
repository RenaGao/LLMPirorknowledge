**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you, Zafar. What do you like to do in your free time?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Free time? I like... um, listen music. Indian music, especially.
**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Indian music is wonderful. Do you have a favorite artist or type of music?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Favorite artist... (pauses) how to say... Kishore Kumar! No, Shah Rukh Khan's songs are nice too.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Moviii... (smiling) I watch... um, latest movies, yes. But I don't know who are new actors. Who is he? (points to a picture on Alex's phone)
**Speaker A (NS:** Ha ha, don't worry! Let me show you some pictures. (starts swiping through his phone)
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oooh, nice! Your phone is... uh, how to say... very cool?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Do you have a favorite game or sport?

**Speaker A (NS):** (smiling) Kho kho is a great game! We should play sometime.
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That... would be nice! Maybe we can play together soon? Okay.
**Speaker A (NS):** (smiling) Absolutely. Well, it was great talking to you, Zafar. Maybe I'll see you around?

**Speaker A (NS):** Inshallah, good. It was nice meeting you too, Zafar. Take care.

Note: Here are a few extra hints for the Urdu speaker and cultural nuances:

*   Instead of simply saying "no" or "not really," the speaker will use "eh" or "um" to fill pauses or display hesitation, similar to Urdu speaking patterns.
*   The speaker uses colloquial expressions like "how to say" when they struggle to find the right word in English.
*   Cultural phrases such as "inshallah" (God willing) are used to show politeness and gratitude.
*   The L2 speaker, Zafar, sometimes uses the Urdu greeting phrase "Assalam o alaikum" when greeting the native speaker, showing his cultural background.
