**Speaker A (Native Speaker):** Hey, Bilal! What's up? You sounded a bit upset over the phone.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! I am upset. You say that I borrow book from you, but I no remember. I think I lend you book.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I think there might be a mix-up. I remember you lending me a book on Urdu poetry. You said it was a rare edition.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Rare edition? I no say that. I say it is... um, special book for you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, maybe we have a different understanding of "special." What do you think happened to the book?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think maybe you give it to someone else? But I no see you giving book to anyone.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's not what I did. Let me think about this. Can you tell me more about the situation?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Well, I ask you about book, but you say it is ready? I no see it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. It sounds like there was a miscommunication. Why didn't you ask your friend who took the book from you, if I recall correctly?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** My friend? I no understand. What you say?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I might be mistaken. But from what you're saying, it seems like I took your book when you lent it to me and then gave it to someone else, or maybe you gave it to someone else yourself and thought it was with me.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ooh, I see. Yes, that is what maybe happen.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, let's clear up the misunderstanding. Why don't we both take a closer look at our books and then meet up to discuss further?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Good idea. Thank you for talking with me, Bilal. I think we clear up the problem now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, good luck with that! Take care, Bilal. Really looking forward to catching up soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):)** Take care! I will say, It was good to talk. Maybe next time I visit your place and we will discuss this in more detail.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Are you satisfied with how we resolved the misunderstanding?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):)His), yes, I am. Please give my best to your family. Ap Baccha!
