**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kanta! I'm really excited to learn about a cultural tradition from your country. Can you tell me about a special celebration in Pakistan?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, thank you. My name is Kanta, not Kenta. *laughs*

**Speaker A (NS):** Sorry about that, Kanta! I'm Khadija. Please go ahead and share your favorite tradition from Pakistan.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay. In Pakistan, we have big celebration called Eid... um, Eid-al-Fitr. It is after Ramadan...

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, Eid-al-Fitr! We've studied that in our history class. What is it like?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It is... um, great time. We wake up early... how to say... before sunrise, and take... shower, yes. Then we eat... um, sehri, and then we go to mosque for prayer.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds beautiful. What do people do after the prayer?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We go to family and friends... um, houses, and share... breakfast, yes. We give gifts, especially to children... um, money, and clothes.

**Speaker A (NS):** I've heard of how children receive gifts!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** *laughs* Yes, they love it. And we also... um, one thing, try... new food. We eat... naan, and kebabs... um, tasty food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Naan and kebabs sounds delicious! How long do you celebrate Eid-al-Fitr in Pakistan?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** A few days... um, five days. We are happy for five days. And also, we help... poor people, by giving them... food, and money.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's truly wonderful. Kanta, thank you so much for sharing your cultural tradition with me!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, Khadija. Your, uh, welcome. *smiles*
