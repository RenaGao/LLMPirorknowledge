**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Welcome to the team, Rohan! I'll explain the process for submitting your weekly reports. It's pretty straightforward.

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Urdu):** Thank you, sir! I am... um... happy to be here. I want to learn new... new things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great attitude, Rohan! So, each week you'll need to submit a report on your progress. Can you tell me what type of report are you most familiar with?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! Report! In my university, I make report like... um, big essay with data analysis.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good foundation! Our reports are actually more like brief summaries of your accomplishments and challenges.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay! Brief report! I understand, sir. But how... how to write it?

**Speaker A (NS):** We have a template that we follow. Let me email it to you, and you can review it before your first report is due. Sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, good! I will... um, check it every day. But how I, um, make it sound good? You know, like... [speaks in Urdu, trying to find the right phrase]... ergat?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think you might mean "and strategattering"? Anyway, just use simple language, use bullet points, and make sure it's concise.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! Simple, bullet point! I like this.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's what we're going for. Also, remember to include any challenges you faced and what you learned from them.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, sir! I will include... um, things like experiment problem!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great attitude, Rohan! Remember, the key is to keep it concise and clear. And don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, sir! I will... um, ask. And I will do my best, insha'Allah!

**Speaker A (NS):** Alhamdulillah! Alright, that was a great introduction. Just to recap, the weekly report template will be emailed to you.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I see, sir! Thank you again! We will have a good time working together, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree! It was great having you here today. May Allah bless you in all you do!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):)** Wa alaykum salam, sir! Thank you, and I am... um, impatient to see you next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Likewise, Rohan! Until then, Subhanallah!

Turn 20: Speaker B (L2, Urdu):) Okay, bye! Good day, sir!
