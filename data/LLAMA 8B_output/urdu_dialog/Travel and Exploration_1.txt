**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there, it's lovely to meet you! Can you tell me a bit about your favorite place to visit?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! Me, Bilal, from Karachi. My favorite place is, um, coastal area... coastal city.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! What’s special about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You see, in our coastal city... um, they have very clean beach. Sand is very fine, like in... uh, powder!

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that sounds lovely. What else do people do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** They like to, um, swimming. And also fishing. Fish from sea and... sell in market. People eat too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Mmm, seafood is delicious. What do you like to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Me, love to, uh, watch the sunset. So peaceful. Sand, sea... it all connect together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds very romantic. Do you go there with friends or family?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes, both! Sometimes with friends for... uh, picnic. We eat, enjoy, and also swim. Um, good times!

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine that’s a wonderful experience. Why do you love this place so much?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Because, it is very simple. Um, not many traffic, no big noise. So peaceful, nature all around... um, wonderful.

**Speaker A (NS):** I get it. I think it's lovely. One last question, how do people get there from Karachi?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, by... um, bus, it takes long, but many routes available. But, if more money, go by plane or train, even faster.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great tips. Well, I think we can summarize: coastal city is very special, famous for clean beach, great place for relaxation. What do you think, should we call this place the crown jewel of Sindh?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, no, not necessarily. Maybe a... uh, treasure, in the sea!

**Speaker A (NS):** Treasure it is, Bilal! Great chatting with you, thanks!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No worries, same! See you maybe another time? Maybe go the coastal city!
