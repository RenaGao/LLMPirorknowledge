**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS)**: Hi, thank you for coming. My name is Rachel, and I'll be working with you today. Can you start by telling me a bit about your fitness goals?
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Urdu)**: Ah, yes, thank you. My name is Sultan. Me from Pakistan. I want to lose... um, weight for my wedding. Three month, I want to be in shape.
**Speaker A (NS)**: Congratulations! Three months is a great goal. Have you exercised regularly before?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: No, I have not. But me used to play... uh, cricket when I was young. I like running, yes.
**Speaker A (NS)**: That's great! Running is an excellent way to get started. What kind of exercise routine do you think you'd be interested in?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: Um, what call... full-body workout? I like do it three time a week. And also, weightlifting, yes.
**Speaker A (NS)**: Full-body workouts and weightlifting can be very effective. I can show you some basic exercises. Do you have any experience with free weights?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: No, I am new. How to say... plate... uh, weights. I will try.
**Speaker A (NS)**: No worries, we'll start with basics. I'll show you how to use dumbbells and a barbell. By the way, are you familiar with the different types of exercises, like push-ups and squats?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: Ah, yes! Me know, yes. Me used to do... um, push-up when I was young. And also, squats.
**Speaker A (NS)**: Excellent. We can modify those exercises to suit your fitness level. How about we start with some simple cardio exercises? Do you have a preferred time to exercise?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: Morning, yes. Me like morning walk. And also, um, lunch break. After work.
**Speaker A (NS):** Those are both great options. We can schedule our sessions during those times. Just to summarize, you're planning to lose weight and get in shape for your wedding. We'll focus on a full-body workout routine with weightlifting, and I'll guide you through some basic exercises.
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: Yes, yes! That sound great, thank you, Rachel.
**Speaker A (NS)**: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Sultan. Don't worry about making mistakes; we'll work together. Speaking of which, I have some handouts about diet tips to help you achieve your goals. Would you like that?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: Ah, thank you. Me will look at it, yes. And I will try to be on... uh, track, yes.
**Speaker A (NS)**: That’s great to hear. We can discuss your progress and make adjustments as needed. And don't forget, my door is always open if you have any questions or need guidance. Thanks again, and I look forward to seeing your progress.

Let's say good morning for a start next time, shall we?

Best of luck, Sultan. We will talk again soon to review your progress and plan our next session.

**Adaptations to Speaker B (L2's) answers and perspectives:**

- "Weight for my wedding" is a typical Pakistani expression for "get in shape" or "lose weight."
- **"Three month" and "I will try to be on uh, uh, track" is where typical self-correction will happen with less proficient L2 speakers. Sometimes in conversations, ‘logjam’ in remembering a word like “track,” even very common words may happen.**
