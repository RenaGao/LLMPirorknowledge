**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Excuse me, can you help me? I'm looking for the city hotel. Could you tell me how to get there?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! Hotel... um, city hotel. I know. (pause) Where are you from?
**Speaker A (NS):** I'm from... (laughs) actually, I'm from the city, but I'm visiting from out of town. I'm not familiar with the area.
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I see! You will easily find hotel. It is near... (thinking) near las ramas.
**Speaker A (NS):** La Rosa? Is there a landmark nearby where I can ask for directions?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes! La... um, big building... near park.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thank you! And which direction do I head? To the left, the right, or straight?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You will... (giggles) um, turn right. No, wait, left. Yes, left.
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, thank you for helping me. Where can I find the nearest landmark, so I can confirm?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You can see... (thinks) um, small lake. That is near hotel.
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, a small lake, that sounds easy to find. Thank you so much for your help!
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Not problem. You are welcome. (pauses) I help, you look easy.
**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) Yes, I looked a bit disoriented. Thank you again!
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** See you! Have a... um, good day.
**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you! Have a great day too.
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Bye!
