**Speaker A (NS):** So, what brings you here today? Do you want to talk about something?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, thank you for asking. My friend, Bilal, and I, we have confuse each other. He say I forget his phone at his house.
**Speaker A (NS):** That can be frustrating. Start from the beginning, what happened?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay. So we go for walk last week... um, on Saturday...
**Speaker A (NS):** Walk, nice! And I'm sure Bilal's phone was with you then?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** He have phone, yes. I think... I mean, I have it.
**Speaker A (NS):** Did you misunderstand each other about the phone?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes. I don't think I, you know... dropped it. I say I put it in my bag, but he no ask me about it until now.
**Speaker A (NS):** I see, so there's been no mention of the phone being misplaced until now. How should you handle this situation?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I don't know. I feel bad. He was angry with me, and I don't understand why.
**Speaker A (NS):** It's natural to feel frustrated. Why do you think Bilal is upset?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Because he need the phone for exam tomorrow, and now it... uh, how to say... not available.
**Speaker A (NS):** So, it's for an exam, and Bilal needs his phone for studying. How would you approach this conversation now?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu:** I should say sorry, yeah. I don't know when he put his phone in my bag. Please let me help him find it.
**Speaker A (NS):** That's a helpful attitude! Consider contacting older parents who've told me, the first thing to say is "Sorry". Restating that, rephrase: apologies for misunderstanding the situation and getting you involved in the first place. Right?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yeah... sorry. "Main sorry hoon" â€“ I was asking... how to say sorry properly in English.
**Speaker A (NS):** In English, it's fine, and moving forward you can apologize with "I'm sorry". Let's create a plan: we can text Bilal and suggest you meet to talk about the phone, so it's out in the open.
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yaa, good idea. Thank you for helping me. Harijan?
**Speaker A (NS):** In the future, end a conversation like that on the phone or message enough with SHALL. Tomorrow then, " karar laya hou" you can meet up, see your friend about explanatory problems of what or an easy or as anticipated as seeing remind.
