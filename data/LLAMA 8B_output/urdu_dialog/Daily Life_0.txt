**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It's good to see you. How's your day going so far?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, salam. It's going... good, I think. Um, my day is...
**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, start with something simple. What did you do first thing in the morning?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay. First, I wash my face. And then, um, my friend ask me... my brother, if uh... good morning, you know?
**Speaker A (NS):** Ha ha, yeah! That's right. So, what's your brother's name by the way?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, it's Mohammad. He... my friend. Now, most morning routine starts with tea, yes?
**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great way to begin the day! Do you have tea every morning?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Uh, yes, my friend. Um... Now, make tea is first priority in my life.
**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) I think you might want to try "first thing on my agenda" instead of "first priority." Sounds like a really positive attitude, though!
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** (laughs) You right, my friend. Good practice!
**Speaker A (NS):** If you take a tea, do you usually eat something with it?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, small food. You know, like puff pastry.
**Speaker A (N:** Puff pastry's a nice touch, a bit civilized for the morning!
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Exactly, like... civilized for my day.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice, nice! That sounds like a lovely breakfast routine!
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thanks, friend. Good wish you a good morning, similar to this conversation, too.
**Speaker A (NS):** All good, let's meet again soon! Saylama!
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Walaikum salam to you too, tak.
**Speaker A (NS):** Have a good day and see you around!
