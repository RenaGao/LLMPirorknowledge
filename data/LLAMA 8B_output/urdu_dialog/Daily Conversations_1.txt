**Turn 3**
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! Are you planning to read any books or watch movies?

**Turn 4**
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, watch movie? No, but yes... book! I want to finish novel, "Shah Rukh Khan stories". You know, biographies?

**Turn 5**
**Speaker A (NS):** I think you might be referring to a book about his life, but I'm not sure which one. Are you enjoying it so far?

**Turn 6**
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes, I like. Um, story about how hard he work to become famous? Audio book, you know?

**Turn 7**
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. So you're listening to an audio book, that's convenient. Do you have any other plans on Sunday?

**Turn 8**
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sunday, hmm... want to go to restaurant with friends. They will come to my place for dinner at... 6, six o'clock?

**Turn 9**
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so you're planning a dinner party at your place. I hope you enjoy it. Do you want to check any movies or concerts in the area?

**Turn 10**
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** (pausing) I think, um, I see... no movie tickets available. But maybe go to nice caf√©, drink some chai?

**Turn 11**
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! I'm sure you'll have a great time at the picnic on Saturday, and eating with friends on Sunday. Did I get all that right?

**Turn 12**
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You miss one thing, no. Remember, we will go to library too. Yes?

**Turn 13**
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, great! I'm glad you reminded me about the library. That's a big plan for the weekend.

**Turn 14**
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yeah, big plan! See you Sat, then. Or Sunday? No... probably Sat.

**Turn 15**
**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful! I'll see you on Saturday at the park! Have a great time.
