**Speaker A (Native Speaker):** Hi there, Sara! Welcome to our local market. What brings you here today?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Urdu):** Ah, hi. Thank you. I buy... uh... clothes for my sister. We look for... um, bag for her.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We have a lot of beautiful bags here. Let me show you some. (pulls out a few bags) How do you like these?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, nice. They are... uh... colorful. (picks up a bag) But how much this cost? Sorry, I no... um, speak much English.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, it's okay. We can communicate in simple English. This bag is priced at 500 rupees.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** 500? Hmm, too expensive for me. Can we... um, go lower price? Maybe 300? 

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Let me see if I can do something for you. (begins to negotiate) How about 450 rupees?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, improve. But no, still too much. Can we go 375? Please?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I'll meet you in the middle. 425 rupees, and it's yours.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** (grinning) Yes! Thank you, very kind. You very good seller!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm glad we could come to an agreement.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes... um, nice do business with you. (laughs)

**Speaker A (NS):** Likewise! Would you like to finish the purchase now?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. I have my money. (pulls out the money) Okay, thank you again!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Enjoy your shopping, Sara.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** (laughs) Thank you... um, enjoy market today!

**Speaker A (NS):** We'll have to do this again soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, (giggles) me too. I bye-bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Latter! Bye, Sara!

Note: Throughout the conversation, the native speaker aims to:
- Foster clear communication with polite expressions
- Clarify misunderstandings without being condescending
Avoid overly complex vocabulary or idioms to make it easier for the L2 speaker.
- Show empathy and patient guidance.

The Second-Language Speaker reflects common realistic mistakes such as:

- Ded wrong-case usage and limiting vocabulary: ("I buy... uh... clothes for my sister.")
- Having trouble expressing thoughts: ("I no... um, speak much English.") or might request more help. ("Can we... um, English communicate?")
- Repeating structure patterns: ("Can we go lower price? Maybe 300?")
- Learning to adapt to cultural phrases commonly used in that area of conversation
