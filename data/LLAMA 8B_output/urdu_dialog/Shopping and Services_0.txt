**Speaker A (Native Speaker, Sarah):** Hi, I'm looking for a new notebook brand. Can you help me?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Ehsan):** Ah, yes, notebook... um, help for writing. Let me see... (chuckles)

**Sarah (NS):** That's right! Writing is what I'm interested in. What do you recommend?

**Ehsan (L2, Urdu):** Okay, we have two good brand. One is... how to say... ball pen... no, sorry. A notebook brand. It is Parker. Yes, Parker and... uh, I forgot name.

**Sarah (NS):** That's alright, don't worry. What about Parker?

**Ehsan (L2, Urdu):** Parker is good quality. It is... um, not so expensive. (Turning leaf through books) Ah, yes! Also, Lincor... I am sure it is spelt like this, L-I-N-C-O-R.

**Sarah (NS):** Lincor is a great choice too. They have a wide range of products.

**Ehsan (L2, Urdu):** Yes, wide range. (chuckles) I study English, but sometimes I find it... you know, difficult to choose.

**Sarah (NS):** (laughs) That's completely normal. English can be challenging.

**Ehsan (L2, Urdu):** Okay, so which one I recommend? Parker or... Lincor? (smiling)

**Sarah (NS):** That's a tough choice. Considering your input, I'd say both are good options.

**Ehsan (L2, Urdu):** (laughs) Okay, thank you. You help me so much.

**Sarah (NS):** It's my pleasure, Ehsan. Do you have a take on which one I might prefer based on your descriptions.

**Ehsan (L2, Urdu):** (hesitates) If you prefer ball pen... I mean, writing, I think Parker is good. Yes, I am sure it is. 

**Sarah (NS):** Alright, that seems like a good starting point. Alright, thank you for your time, Ehsan.

**Ehsan (L2, Urdu):** (Apresently) I help also. (promises) Come back when you want more recommendation.

**Sarah (NS):** Thank you, Ehsan. Recommended store closed, I gathered what you said I should check.
