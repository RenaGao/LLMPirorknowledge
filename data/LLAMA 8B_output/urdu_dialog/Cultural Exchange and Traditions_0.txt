**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there. Today, I'd like to talk about some cultural traditions from around the world. Can you tell me about one of the festivals or celebrations from your culture, where you grew up speaking Urdu?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, thank you. In my country, a big festival is Eid al-Fitr. We celebrate... um, after Ramadan, you know the holy month?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I do. So, Eid al-Fitr is a time of celebration after fasting for a month?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes! People give alms to each other. And family comes together for... you know, big dinner. With, uh, sweet, called gulab jamun.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful. And what's a special tradition that you enjoy during Eid al-Fitr?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! We wear... you know, bright clothes on Eid day. Also, shopping is big this time of year. People... um, how to say... decorate home with lights, and flowers.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great way to celebrate. Do you have a favorite tradition from your childhood?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes! At Eid time, my family says... traditional prayer. And after prayer, we... visit our elder. They give us, uh, money as a gift.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's beautiful. It's great that you value your heritage. Can you tell me more about the food that you enjoy during this time?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes! Food is... big part of Eid. We eat... um, with family and friends. Many types of bread... in sweet sauce, called korma.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious. It's great to share this with you today. Would you like to describe another tradition from your culture sometime?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that would be great! Thank you for your help, and... your friendship.
