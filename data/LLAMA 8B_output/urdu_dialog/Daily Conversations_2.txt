**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS)**: Hi, how's it going? I'm glad you could make it today. Can you tell me about a recent memorable event in your life?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Urdu)**: Ah, yes, thank you. Um... let me think for a moment. One event that, how to say, come to my mind is when I visit my ancestral village recently. My family meet my relatives and, you know, we had such a good time. Everyone share their, uh, food and stories.

**Speaker A (NS)**: That sounds like a wonderful experience! What made it so memorable for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: I think it's because we, um, sit together for, how long, two hours? And everyone share their, uh, love for me. It was very heartwarming experience.

**Speaker A (NS)**: That must have felt really nice. What did you feel during that moment?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: I feel, um, happy. Very happy. And also a little, uh, sad because I know that, how to say, we're not going to meet for a long time.

**Speaker A (NS)**: I understand. It's nice to see family and make new memories. Did anything particular stand out from that trip?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: Yes, one thing that, um, make me laugh so much was when my, uh, granddad, he tell a joke. It was so silly, but everyone, uh, laugh together.

**Speaker A (NS)**: That's great! Laughter is such a wonderful way to bring people together. I'm sure that was a really special moment.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: Yes, it was.

**Speaker A (NS)**: Well, I'm glad you could share that with me. I'm sure it's been enlightening.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu)**: Thank you, it was a nice conversation.

**Speaker A (NS)**: Likewise. It’s always lovely to hear about each other’s experiences. I'm looking forward to our next conversation.
