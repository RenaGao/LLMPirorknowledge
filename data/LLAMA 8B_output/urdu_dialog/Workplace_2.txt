**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Kameran, thanks for coming to the team meeting. I'm Raj, your supervisor. Let's discuss your role in the customer service team.

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Urdu):** Hi, Raj. I go to Pakistan for five year, but I come back here...

**Speaker A (NS):** Welcome back! So, we reviewed the job description. It says you'll be handling client calls. Can you tell me a little about your experience in customer-facing roles?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. I help people in... um, one call centre job in Pakistan. I answer phone... how to say... they ask for help?

**Speaker A (NS):** Phone calls for help. What kind of skills do you have that would be useful in this position?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I speak English, of course. And Urdu, of course. But I have also... um, good computer knowledge. I use Microsoft Office, Word, Excel...

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We use the same software here. Now, let's go over the team's goals. Our main priority is resolving customer complaints within 24 hours. Can you think of any ways you could contribute to this effort?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes. I think... if customer have problem, I listen carefully and try to... how to say... see solution. Then I explain to customer.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent approach. We encourage active listening in our team. Now, let's look at the process flowchart. I'd like to show you how our system works.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, thank you. I see. How to say... many steps.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, there are several checkpoints. If you encounter any issues, ask your colleagues, and we'll support you. By the way, have any questions so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, no. But, um, one think. Sometimes customer will argue?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's normal. Our training program covers conflict resolution strategies. We'll review them with you during orientation.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Good. Thank you, Raj. You a good teacher.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you, Kameran! I'm looking forward to working with you. Now, let's summarize. You'll focus on customer satisfaction, handle calls efficiently, and respond to complaints effectively. Does that seem right?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that's right.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent! I think we're ready to get started. It was nice discussing this with you, Kameran. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, Raj. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Kameran. See you tomorrow!

Kameran is excited to take on his new role, having learned about the essential components and expectations in the conversation with Raj.
