**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for joining me today! Can you tell me about a skill you're interested in learning?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, thank you. My name is Farhan, and I from Lahore. I... um, I want to learn... how to play guitar. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you, Farhan! Why is playing the guitar something you want to learn?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like music, sir. I play some time on my phone, but I want to learn proper. It is good for... um, my stress, my friend said.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Having a hobby can be very relaxing. Do you have a favorite type of music you'd like to play?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes! Old Bollywood songs, sir. I like Lata Mangeshkar lady, her voice is... hamari bhi mummy jaanti hai (we also know in our mom).

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, lovely! Lata Mangeshkar is an iconic singer. Can you tell me what you like about her voice?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, her... her Giriftai ki gayai (melody, I think). Very good, sir.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great word, "Giriftai." Do you have any plans for practicing guitar once you start learning?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes, I want to make my sister's marriage... um, gift. We have function next month, hain (it will happen).

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a thoughtful gesture. Well, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me, Farhan. It was nice talking with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, sir. You very nice. I... um, I will try to practice guitar now?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's super! We'll catch up soon, okay? Take care.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Tha kee khair, sir (fine, thank you, sir). Goodbye.

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Farhan! It was a pleasure!
