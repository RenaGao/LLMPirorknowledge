**Speaker A (NS):** Hi everyone! Today, we're planning a weekend picnic with our family. What do you think of the idea, Khamid?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! I like picnic very much! My family love... um, spending time together outside.
**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful! Where are we planning to go for this picnic?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We can go... um, park nearby. I hear it has many... uh, green space.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! You know, it's a good thing you mentioned the park. We can also check if they have a playground for the kids.
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes, my children will like that. We pack... um, sandwiches, fruit, and... uh, cookies?
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a great spread! And we shouldn't forget to bring plenty of water.
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, water is very important. My mother always tell me that.
**Speaker A (NS):** Good reminder! So, let's summarize our plans. We're having a picnic at the nearby park on Saturday, right?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes! That sounds good. One more thing. We... um, forget the blanket. You need blanket to sit on, yes?
**Speaker A (NS):** Leave the blanket at home, so we won't have to carry it. That sounds fine!
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay! I feel better now. It seem like we... uh, have everything.
**Speaker A (NS):** With your help, Khamid, I'm confident we'll have a wonderful picnic! Shall we call it a day?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes! I think we have good plan. Thank you for helping me, Ayesha.
**Speaker A (NS):** It was my pleasure, Khamid! See you tomorrow, then. It'll be fun!
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Goodbye! Sleep well!
**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Khamid. Have a good sleep!
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Goodbye! We will picnic the next day.
