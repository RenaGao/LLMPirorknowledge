**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey, Kanta! What are you up to tonight? Want to plan something fun?
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Urdu):** Ah, yes, thank you. I free tonight. Um, choose restaurant... or... or park?
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, great idea! There’s a new Japanese place that just opened up. Or we could go to the park for a walk?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, Japanese food! My favourite. Or... um, walk in park. Yes, park.
**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! Let's make a plan. If it’s a nice evening, how about we go to the park first and then grab dinner?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. Good plan. We go park, then... then go to restaurant.
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a perfect plan! What kind of Japanese food are you in the mood for?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, sushi... or... um, noodles? I like noodles.
**Speaker A (NS):** Noodles are a great choice! There’s a sushi place that serves an amazing pho.
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Pho? No, no... uh, how to say... dish with rice?
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I think you mean a curry dish. We can definitely check that out! What time should we meet up?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, 6 o’clock? Um, you say... 6 o'clock?
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right! 6 o’clock sounds perfect. I’ll meet you at the park then?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, 6 o'clock park. I look forward to it.
**Speaker A (NS):** Can’t wait! See you soon.
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Good! Goodbye, thank you.
**Speaker A (NS):** Have a great evening, Kanta!
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too, thank you!

Note: The speaker, Kanta, uses filler words like "um" to collect her thoughts and to ask the speaker to repeat back to confirm understanding of the terms, often resulting in a lose translation but ultimately providing both speakers maintain a flowing conversation, showcasing L2 skills, the conversation will seem effortless, even with linguistic errors as we assumed.
