SpeakerB's response before saying goodbye “How to be goodbye in your side? in you language of *Urdu for English people.* 
It simply means say that “main bye kerta“ or is short for good.
SpeakerA would say. We have said something good or agreed on both we feel good then after that they share a brief expression of *the end.
