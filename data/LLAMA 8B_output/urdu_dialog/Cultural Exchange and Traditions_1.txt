**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Kita, it's great to meet you. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and where you're from?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, thank you. I'm from Pakistan, Lahore. I study here in university.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! What brought you to study in this country?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I come here for... um, education. My father say it's good for future.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. I'd love to learn more about your culture. Can you tell me about some common phrases or customs in Pakistan?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes. In Pakistan, when we eat, we use... um, hands. We don't use fork or spoon always. Also, we greet with... namaste. But with close family, we say "chemistry".

**Speaker A (NS):** That's fascinating! I've heard of the namaste greeting. What's with the "chemistry"?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, it... um, expression of love. We say it to people we care about, like family.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. I think I understand. So, when people go on dates, do they show affection in a certain way?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes. We don't show kiss or hug with close family, but on... um, romantic date, it's okay.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's interesting. I guess everyone has their cultural norms and expectations. What about dining etiquette? How do Pakistanis typically handle table manners?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. We eat with right hand, usually. And when someone invites, we say "you[r] very welcome" but actually means "I'm hungry".

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a nice way to acknowledge their invitation. Thank you, Kita, for sharing your insights about Pakistani culture. 

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, my pleasure. It's nice to share.

**Speaker A (NS):** Now I'd love to get back, but before I go, can I summarize what we've talked about?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, yes. Pakistan customs, dining, and... um, thanking.

**Speaker A (NS):** And the meanings behind "chemistry"?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** And saying "chemistry" with close family.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Have a great day, Kita, and it was wonderful chatting with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too, thank you, goodbye.  It was nice talking to you.
