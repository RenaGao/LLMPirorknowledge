**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS)**: Hi there! I'm lost in this new town. Can you help me find the city museum?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Urdu)**: Ah, yes! Museum? Hmm, how you say? Um, "=[]
from the museum ah?"

**Speaker A (NS)**: Yes, that's correct. I want to visit the museum on Main Street.

**Speaker B (L2)**: Main Street? Ah, yes! One minute left-this way. You follow me, please?

**Speaker A (NS)**: Thanks. So you're saying we need to turn left here?

**Speaker B (L2)**: Yes, yes. Left here. Then you see big park. Right after park, you enter museum road.

**Speaker A (NS)**: Great, that helps. What should we look for around the park?

**Speaker B (L2)**: It have big gate, wall, garden. Many thing to see.

**Speaker A (NS)**: Sounds great. How long does the museum take to visit?

**Speaker B (L2)**: Um, three to five hour? No, too long. One, two hour would be enough. You don't have time for all things.

**Speaker A (NS)**: That's what I was thinking. I have a limited time.

**Speaker B (L2)**: Right! Main thing is museum is inside. But if you, um, take last train, you can see, like, how city feel.

**Speaker A (NS)**: I see what you mean. It's a good way to experience the town.

**Speaker B (L2)**: Yes, yes! Good experience. You ask me question, again later?

**Speaker A (NS)**: No need, thank you for your help. You were very clear. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2)**: You too, have good day!
