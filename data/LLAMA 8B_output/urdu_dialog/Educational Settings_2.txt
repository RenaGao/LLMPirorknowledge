**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, let's discuss the new topic for our study group tonight. What's your initial thought about the economic sanctions on a country?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes... so san... sootion on country... how to say... it is bad or good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, so it's a complex issue. Can you start by describing the economic sanctions?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Economic... um, how to say... restriction on business... and also, some government make... stop trade, no?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right. It's a way for governments to apply pressure on another country. Can you explain why you think economic sanctions are useful?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Well... um, I think it stop bad things, like selling illegal... um, weapons, or smuggling money. Yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Actually, that's a great point. Sanctions can be used to prevent countries from engaging in those activities. What do you think about the impact on normal citizens, though?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes... um, people have to suffer... hardship, how to say... food, medicine... difficult.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see your point. It's true that sanctions can have unintended consequences on civilians. Can you tell me more about how a country would respond to economic sanctions?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Well... um, country try to... um, find ways to fix problem... go around sanctions. Um, diplomacy, no?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good example. Diplomacy is indeed a way for countries to work around sanctions. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this complex topic!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you... um, nice to talk...

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I think our group agrees that sanctions are a multifaceted issue. It was great discussing this with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes... and thank you... um, bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, and see you next time!
