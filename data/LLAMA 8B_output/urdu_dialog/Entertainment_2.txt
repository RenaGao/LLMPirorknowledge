**Speaker A (NS):** Do you need any help finding a good book? I heard about a great novel lately.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, good book... thank you for... um, help. What book title... you want to recommend?

**Speaker A (NS):** One I've been meaning to read is "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari. Have you heard of it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sapiens? I know. Someone... mention to me but I have not read. What is... um, book about?

**Speaker A (NS):** It's about the history of humanity, how we developed from small groups to the global population we are today. It's a broad scope, but a very thought-provoking read.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, interesting. Broad scope... like um, history of universe? Or different countries?

**Speaker A (NS):** It covers the development of human societies, but also the challenges we've faced, like the impact of science and technology on our societies.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I see. Science and technology... that is very important for me. I like to use technology in my studies.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it's a crucial part of our progress. I think you'd find the book valuable in understanding how it all fits together.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you for... help me decide. I will try to read Sapiens. What... do you think I should know about book?

**Speaker A (NS):** Be prepared for some complex ideas and how the author challenges common assumptions. It's a thick book, so it'll take time, but worth the read.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I see. Complex ideas... uh, challenges assumptions. I like to learn from books. Thank you for recommend.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. Let me know if you have any questions as you read it.
