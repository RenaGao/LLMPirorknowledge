**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thank you for reaching out to our customer service. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue you're experiencing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, thank you very much. Um, recently I buy a... a thing for fixing paper. It say "stapler" on it, but it not work like that.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's see what we can do about that. Can you tell me more about what's not working with the stapler? Is it not stapling properly or...?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, stapling. It staple upside-side-down, you know? Like splatting onto page instead.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's not what it's supposed to do, I'm sure! Have you tried using the arrows on the stapler to adjust the staple orientation?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, I try. But arrows also upside-down... or maybe not work at all. I am very confuse.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, okay, let me see if I can help clarify. Have you tried checking the user manual to see if there are any troubleshooting steps or instructions on using the stapler?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes. But I no find... a-few word... uh, " polo≈æky" not my any language.

**Speaker A (NS):** "Poklaje"? Let me see if I can try looking it up real quick.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, it is not "poklaje". Really, it is just stapler not work right. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, no, I have the stapler manual right here. And I notice that our thing... the product we sold you may have been incorrectly packaged.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Aaah, yes! That I think is problem. Is company return... uh, finish thing. I get my money back?
