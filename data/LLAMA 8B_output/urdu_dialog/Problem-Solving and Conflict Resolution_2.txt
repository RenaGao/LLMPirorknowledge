**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, thank you. Office... um, problem. I try to help.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great, Bilal! Can you tell me what you think is the biggest issue?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Laptop... slow. And paper... too much paper. I think we need, um...

**Speaker A (NS):** Make more digital files?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes! Digital files. And we must, uh... how to say... implement plan to reduce paper.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! What specific steps do you propose we take?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We must, um, create list of tasks. And, uh, assign deadlines. And, I think...

**Speaker A (NS):** Regular meetings to update status?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes! Meetings. And we need, um... encouragement. Urge each other to...

**Speaker A (NS):** Stay motivated!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes! Motivated. Now, I think we have plan.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great, Bilal! I'm glad we agree.
