**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal, thanks for chatting with me today! Can you tell me about your goals for the next year?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, thank you, Ayesha. My goal... um, how to say... my goal is to learn more English word and improve writing skill.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! What kind of writing do you hope to do?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I want to write... um, like short story for contest. I like fiction and also essay for school.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Can you tell me about your study plan to reach this goal?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes... one thing I try daily... um, I mean, I try to read one English book every week.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's fantastic! And how will you manage your time to dedicate to reading?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Well, I already wake up early and do my study first, then I use one hour for reading.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's responsible. How do you plan to keep track of your progress?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um... I use... uh, reporting? Yes, I make note every week what I read and how many page I finish.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, that's a great system. Can you share a time when you had to overcome a challenge while learning English?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes... one time when I learn new grammar... um, verb tense it's tricky for me, but then I find YouTube video, it very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure that was helpful. How can I support you in achieving your goals?
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You... um, help me to speak English fluently more. Maybe we have practice conversation one-to-one.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'd love that! It was great talking to you today, Bilal. I think we made some progress on both our goals. 
**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, Ayesha! I'm glad we had conversation. Maybe see you next week?
