**Speaker A (Native Speaker 1):** Hey, Sarah! I'm completely lost in this town. Can you tell me which direction to head to find the Parkview Hotel? I'm booked in for tonight.

**Speaker B (Native Speaker 2):** Ah, yeah! I can help you out. The Parkview Hotel is actually not too far from here. If you head straight down this main street, you'll see a big coffee shop on your left. Just cross the road, and take a right at the light. It's going to be the third building on your right – you can't miss it!

**Speaker A (NS):** A coffee shop? I could use a cappuccino anyway! Thanks for the tip. How do I know I'm at the right light?

**Speaker B (NS):** You'll see a big sign on the corner that says "Oak Street". Take a right at that sign, and then you'll see the hotel on your right. It's kind of hard to miss, actually!

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm glad to hear that. I was worried I'd end up walking around in circles. Do you know if the hotel has any parking available?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, they definitely have parking available. If you see a parking lot on your right just after you take the right at the Oak Street sign, that belongs to the hotel. It's kind of a small lot, but it should fit your car comfortably.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect! I really appreciate your help. Do you want to grab that cappuccino with me before I head off?

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds like a great idea! I could use a coffee break about now. Let me just double-check the hotel's hours real quick.

**Speaker A (NS):** Go ahead! I'll just savor the coffee shop ad on the street sign for a minute.

**Speaker B (NS):** Ah, yeah! The hotel is open till 10 PM, so I think you'll be okay even if you check in a bit later than expected. Now, which coffee shop was that? Um... which one was it again, by the way?

**Speaker A (NS):** The one you said on your left just before the light, right?

**Speaker B (NS):** Ah, yeah! That's the one! The day I'm from has the best coffeehouses in our county!

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure they do! It's always refreshing to have good coffee when you're traveling!

**Speaker B (NS):** Seriously! Now, off you go! Hold up; here, let me give you a quick map to help you find your way.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks a million! This will definitely help me out in case I, um, get lost again

**Speaker B (NS):** Haha, no worries, I know the feeling! Take care, and enjoy your stay at Parkview!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Thanks again for your time, Sarah – it was nice chatting with you!

**Speaker B (NS):** Likewise, you're welcome!
