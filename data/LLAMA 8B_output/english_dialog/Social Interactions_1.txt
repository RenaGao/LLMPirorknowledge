**Speaker A (Alex):** Hey, Mike! What's up? Thanks for meeting up today. I've got an idea I think you'll love.
**Speaker B (Mike):** Hey, Alex! Not much, man. I'm psyched to be here. What's this idea you're stoked about?
**Speaker B (Mike):** I've been racking my brain for weeks to come up with the perfect birthday surprise for Emma, and I think I need your help.
**Speaker A (Alex):** Sounds like a mission! What kind of surprise were you thinking of when you first started planning it?
**Speaker B (Mike):** Honestly, I was hoping to do something big, like plan a weekend getaway or throw her a huge party, but with the budget we have, we need to get creative.
**Speaker A (Alex):** I totally get it. A low-key surprise could be just as special. What's Emma's style like?
**Speaker B (Mike):** Em's all about intimate gatherings with close friends and family, so maybe that's what we should focus on.
**Speaker A (Alex):** That helps narrow it down. What if we organize a small dinner party at her place with her favorite foods?
Turn 7 –
**Speaker B (Mike):** Wait, that's a pretty solid idea. How are we going to keep it a secret, though?
**Speaker A (Alex):** That's the million-dollar question. We can all chip in and work together to plan it, and then I'll make sure to get in touch with the caterers and decorators in secret.
**Speaker B (Mike):** Ha! You're so right. How about we get Emma's sister to help with the tech tasks, too?
**Speaker A (Alex):** Nice thinking! And for the cake, what if we order it from that bakery that Emma loves?
**Speaker B (Mike):** You're a lifesaver! I've been agonizing over whether to do a themed cake or not.
**Speaker A (Alex):** Let's stick with what she loves – a classic vanilla with some chocolate decorations.
**Speaker B (Mike):** How about adding some special decorations to the backyard to make it feel cozy and special?
**Speaker A (Alex):** That sounds amazing. What if we weave some fairy lights around the patio and set up a photo booth with some fun props?
**Speaker B (Mike):** Now I'm totally stoked. You know what they say, "actions speak louder than words" – and your ideas are putting this surprise over the top!
**Speaker A (Alex):** Aw, thanks, Mike! It's all about making memories for Emma. I'm really glad we could brainstorm together.
**Speaker B (Mike):** Yeah, it's shaping up to be an unforgettable day. Can we finalize the plans and meet up in three days to put everything in motion?
**Speaker A (Alex):** Sounds like a plan to me. Who knows, maybe we'll even have a little help from above.
**Speaker B (Mike):** Okay, sounds like it's all coming together nicely. Catch you then, and thanks for the brilliant suggestions!
**Speaker A (Alex):** Absolutely, see you soon. Have a great day!
