**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, welcome to the apartment! I'm so glad you're finally here. I'm Emma, by the way.
**Speaker B (NS):** Hi Emma, nice to meet you! I'm Max. I'm excited to be living here. So, how do I fit in?
**Speaker A (NS):** Well, come on in and make yourself at home. So, I heard you're a bit of a foodie, right?
**Speaker B (NS):** Totally! I love cooking, um, trying new recipes and flavors, you know? What's your favorite dish to make for yourself?
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, great question! I'm actually a huge fan of making chicken fajitas. It's so easy to whip up, and it's always a crowd-pleaser.
**Speaker B (NS):** Ooh, nice choice! I'm actually big on cooking pasta dishes, especially carbonara and spaghetti Bolognese. What's your secret ingredient in the fajitas?
**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I think it's all about using fresh, high-quality ingredients. I use chicken breast, a bunch of bell peppers, onions, and a secret spice mix. It gives it this amazing flavor!
**Speaker B (NS):** Wow, that sounds incredible! I'll have to try that out and maybe bring some of my pasta dishes to the mix.
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great idea! It's always nice to have some cooking buddies to share recipes with. Do you have a favorite tool or gadget that makes your cooking life easier?
**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, yeah! I have a handheld spiralizer that makes zucchini noodles a breeze. It's changed the way I make pesto pasta!
**Speaker A (NS):** Whoa, that's cool! I've been meaning to get myself a spiralizer, too. I might have to "trade" kitchen gadgets with you later
**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan! I need to get some more chopping boards anyway. Alright, I'm all settled in now. Guess I'm buying dinner for you next week?
**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, sounds great! I'm looking forward to trying some of Max's pasta creations. Why don't we "hang loose" about the dinner plans for now?
**Speaker B (NS):** Sweet as, Emma! See you then! Bye, chef!
**Speaker A (NS):) Oh no, you got me with the food pun! Anyway, bye, Max! It was great talking to you, and don't hesitate to ask if you need any cooking advice.
**Speaker B (NS):** No worries, Emma. You too! Have a fantastic day, and we'll cook up some delicious memories.
**Speaker A (NS):** Nice one! I'm still looking forward to those pasta dishes and new friendships. See you soon, Max!
**Speaker B (NS):** Likewise, everyone. Later.
