**Speaker A (Emily):** Hey, Sarah! I'm so glad we could meet up before the exam. How's your study prep going?

**Speaker B (Sarah):** Hi Emily! I'm getting there, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I've been trying to cram all the material into my head, but it's not sticking.

**Speaker A (Emily):** I totally get it. I've been there too. What's the most challenging part of the exam for you?

**Speaker B (Sarah):** Um, I think it's the math section. I'm just not sure how to approach it. Do you have any tips?

**Speaker A (Sarah):** Actually, I was thinking of making a concept map to visualize the formulas and equations. It really helped me last time.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** That's a great idea! I'll give it a try. What about the essay section? I'm worried I won't be able to write a coherent response.

**Speaker A (Emily):** Yeah, that can be tough. But I found that breaking down the question into smaller parts and making an outline really helps. It makes it feel less daunting.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** That makes sense. I'll try that too. Do you have any advice on how to stay focused during the exam?

**Speaker A (Emily):** For me, it's all about taking deep breaths and reminding myself that I've studied hard. Plus, I like to visualize myself acing the exam.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** Ha! That's a great attitude to have. I'll try to do the same. Thanks for the tips, Emily!

**Speaker A (Emily):** No problem, happy to help! We can also study together before the exam if you want.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** That would be awesome! I'd love to go over some practice questions with you.

**Speaker A (Emily):** Sounds like a plan! Let's exchange numbers and make a study date for next week.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** Sounds good to me. Thanks again, Emily!

**Speaker A (Emily):** No worries, take care and good luck on the exam!

**Speaker B (Sarah):** You too, Emily! See you soon!

**Speaker A (Emily):** Bye for now, Sarah!

**Speaker B (Sarah):** Bye!
