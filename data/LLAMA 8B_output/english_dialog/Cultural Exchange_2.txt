**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sarah! I'm so glad we finally caught up. I was wondering if you could share one thing with me that's truly unique about your hometown in Singapore.

**Speaker B (NS):** Ah, okay! In Singapore, I think my favorite holiday has to be Hari Raya Puasa. It's really special to me. You know how it's all about breaking fast and being with family?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! I can see why it would be an important holiday. In many Western cultures, I think our big holiday is Christmas. What do people usually do during Hari Raya Puasa?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, it's a bit like Thanksgiving in the States. People gather at their family members' homes for dinner and prayer. The atmosphere is super lively and festive! And the food, oh man! Sorry, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, no worries, I can relate! Food is a big part of our holidays too. But I'm curious, what's the significance behind the special prayers?

**Speaker B (NS):** We have these prayers called Surah Yassin, which is where we seek forgiveness and ask for blessings. It's really meaningful, and I love how everyone comes together. That's not typical between harmonious relatives.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can see why that would be meaningful. In Western holidays, we often focus on giving gifts and eating. I think it's interesting that the focus in Islamic holidays like Hari Raya Puasa is very different.

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, totally! Ultimately, I guess the values of family bonding and gratitude remain the same, but the ways we celebrate them differ.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We should appreciate and learn from those differences. Well, thanks for sharing some insights about Hari Raya Puasa with me. That was fascinating.

**Speaker B (NS):** No worries at all! It was great talking to you too. Next time, I'd love to hear more about your Christmas traditions.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! Let's catch up again soon and swap holiday stories. Until then, cheers!

**Speaker B (NS):** Cheers, you too, and have a great day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You as well. Excellent conversation, Sarah. It was wonderful hearing about Hari Raya Puasa.
