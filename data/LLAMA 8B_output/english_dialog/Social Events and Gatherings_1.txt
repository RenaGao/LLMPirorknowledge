**Speaker A (Emily):** Hey, Sarah! I'm so excited to plan a surprise party for our friend, Rachel. She's been going through a tough time lately, and I think it's time we show her some love.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** That's a great idea, Emily! Rachel deserves it. What's the theme you had in mind?

**Speaker A (Emily):** I was thinking of a movie night theme. We could decorate the place with movie posters and have a projector screen for a movie marathon.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** That sounds awesome! What movie would you choose?

**Speaker A (Emily):** Hmm, that's a tough one. How about we have a mix of her favorite movies? We could have a playlist of her favorite songs too.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** That's a fantastic idea! I'm sure she'll love it. What about the guest list? Who should we invite?

**Speaker A (Sarah):** We should invite all of our close friends and family members. And maybe some of her coworkers, too.

**Speaker B (Emily):** That's a great point. We should also make sure to keep it a secret until the big reveal.

**Speaker A (Emily):** Absolutely! I'll make sure to keep it under wraps. What about the food and drinks? Should we have a catering service or make it a potluck?

**Speaker B (Sarah):** I think a potluck would be a great idea. We can ask everyone to bring their favorite dish.

**Speaker A (Emily):** That way, we'll have a variety of food and it'll be more fun. What about the surprise element? How do you think we should reveal it to Rachel?

**Speaker B (Sarah):** We could have her come over for a normal movie night and then surprise her with the party. Or we could plan a fake movie night and then surprise her with the party.

**Speaker A (Emily):** I like the second idea. It'll be more exciting that way. Okay, I think we have a solid plan. Let's start making the invitations and decorations.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** Sounds like a plan! I'll help you with the decorations and you can work on the invitations.

**Speaker A (Emily):** Great, thanks for your help, Sarah! I really appreciate it.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** No problem, happy to help. Let's make this a night to remember for Rachel!

**Speaker A (Emily):** Absolutely! I'll send you the details of the plan and we can finalize everything.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** Sounds good. I'll keep an eye on my email for the details.

**Speaker A (Emily):** Okay, I think that's all for now. Let's catch up soon and finalize the plans.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** Sounds good to me. Have a great day, Emily!

**Speaker A (Emily):** You too, Sarah! Take care and let's plan to meet up soon to finalize the surprise party plans.

**Speaker B (Sarah):** Will do! Bye for now!

**Speaker A (Emily):** Bye, Sarah!
