**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, what's up Alex? I heard you're considering planning a group vacation. Am I right?
**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, that's totally true. Me and some friends have been bouncing around ideas. We want it to be somewhere exciting and outdoorsy, maybe with some relaxing vibes, you know?
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. Have you guys decided on a destination or are you all still in the air?
**Speaker B (NS):** Hmm, not exactly. We tossed around the usual suspects – a beach trip in Hawaii, an adventure in Yosemite, or possibly a cultural adventure in Europe, but nothing concrete yet.
**Speaker A (NS):** That's where I come in. I actually have a ton of experience organizing group trips for my friends' reunions, so I could offer some assistance.
**Speaker B (NS):** I'd love some advice. This is our first big group vacay, and we're in over our heads a bit – we want something epic but with some downtime built in, but it's kinda hard to narrow down the scope.
**Speaker A (NS):** For sure, got it. Give me a breakdown of your wish list. Like, what specific activities and things you'd be interested in for the trip – that will make it way easier to help tailor the perfect place.
**Speaker B (NS):** Good point, it's really everything. Outdoor sports, naturey stuff, art, culture – and just downtime to hang around and catch our breath.
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, sound like a winner. For each of those desires, what percentage would you rank them, e.g. relaxation, nature = 50-60%, with a slight margin for activities being around 70-80, and so forth?
**Speaker B (NS):** Um, tough call – that's actually insightful. Let's say... (pauses a bit) fine, around... 70-ish for the first two and we can see around 30ish for activities overall?
**Speaker A (NS):** Interesting, this pattern gives us insight into the "ideal trip scale" that blends your love of relaxation with still enough structure & activity for us to get moving.
**Speaker B (NS):** Precisely - you really grasped that nicely. With both our wishes more balanced now (chuckles, um) okay, maybe just one destination type to really highlight – and possibly the US with some natural sceneries at its heart I'd think – am I getting some of the logic right here somehow?
**Speaker A (NS):) I totally sense where you’re going, keep going! Think we might fit a mountain combo in – Yellowstone or even Aspen, say you'd get away from all and just experience new surroundings for maybe a bit deeper exploration. Something we both kinda want and want to stay more than one city – not at all but then there are reasons why a great destination does actually get people very excited?
**Speaker B (NS):)** I can completely see where the idea fits & what's missing is perhaps where the whole picture will become better with maybe – more, as I am already excited now it’s actually even better and has the real balance I had at the back & that it'll also feel perfect when all, including even possibly more to discuss and do! – all around a US one spot combo you see what your vision means (pauses thinking) it becomes really interesting you know I even like your other idea a mix of natural to urban maybe. That actually got me pretty worked up to want it.
**Speaker A (NS):** Alright Alex our US spot pick might work perfect. If planning is what it would be best here then the actual combo should help get some very exciting, so now to figure out exactly - I've kinda already said about a possible USA trip location; you were at a 55-65 – that still shows we've moved in right towards your 'type' which's great news with that US Mountain combo and will get away totally relaxed but for some other super cool reasons all of that time too you’ll see?
**Speaker B (NS):** (smirks, satisfied) Ah absolutely! So at this point a combo seems all that we’ll need now the best thing might just become pretty obvious & would probably want US – now when I really give this the total balance now like that  a bit too in between then US will definitely provide all you two of our 70, in a natural landscape & it now also offers to you & really a super solid, relaxing one that would always fit both as you just like me do I really can understand what your friend wants & how & when this comes out perfectly at last?
**Speaker A (NS):)** That makes way more sense since you also liked my urban - natural idea from before; just one US - combo is good to be your trip pick all that US now is our mountain destination I wanted you to realize the value; so for once I see so many ideas at play all working out just exactly how much for both US this is so close now so happy I helped really you and, and for good reasons this must be really getting exciting and yes we really only have  the one great group trip location remaining.
**Speaker B (NS):** All set for excitement then; to sum it, our ideal 'US' type destination that gets all that - balance perfectly at last really combines our perfect choice – for good reasons & then the real picture comes to both our trips overall - in particular I loved mountain, relaxing. That trip choice was our 70 for more, perfect  balance that comes to a near end; (chuckles thinking) with, now just with this we had to really agree that I should just thank the other and - now to thank you - since I am absolutely grateful, your ideas made lots of things get really more relaxed, with nature & it helps with my thoughts just getting that out in this relaxed setting we must say – thank you again truly!
**Speaker A (NS):)** Just as we expected - thanks much Alex. Catch you around I hope.
**Speaker B (NS):) Likewise you can have a happy day and maybe we’ll both meet up after that.
 
In the English conversation generated earlier, the main speakers are expressing their desire and interest in sharing a perfect 70/US trip pick (70- percentage) - perfectly blending in & out relaxation/activities – it seems now clear they were already getting more - in on planning, then as it now takes on US perfect destination to do all - finally now a decision made – best to US a combo now just perfect and just what I know I could enjoy and love also now the actual balance to find perfect combo then the end becomes a little harder but that combo still looks, seems good here, a more balanced perfect.
