**Speaker A (Mike):** Hey, John! I'm glad you could make it to our study group today. There's a challenging topic I wanted to touch base with you about: effective time management for exams. We both know how stressful it can be, so I'd love to hear your thoughts.

**Speaker B (John):** Yeah, no worries, I'm happy to chat about it. You're right; time management is crucial, especially when it comes to exams. I've been trying to use a schedule, but I'm not sure if it's the most effective way.

**Speaker A (Mike):** That's a good start, John. I've heard about a concept called the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a five-minute break. Have you heard about it?

**Speaker B (John):** Actually, I have! I was talking to a friend who uses it, and it seems like it could be really helpful. But I'm not sure how well it would stick for me.

**Speaker A (Mike):** That's understandable, John. Too often, we get caught up in multitasking, and it's hard to stay focused. What do you think is the biggest obstacle when it comes to staying focused during studying?

**Speaker B (John):** For me, it's social media. I find myself constantly scrolling through my phone, which is a huge productivity killer. Do you have any tips for managing that?

**Speaker A (Mike:** Yeah, I do! One thing I've started doing is setting specific times to check social media, so it doesn't distract me throughout the day. You might want to try that. Additionally, consider using website blockers like Freedom or SelfControl.

**Speaker B (John):** That's a solid idea. I might give that a try. I also think that for me, it's easy to get sucked into ' Academic procrastination.' Sometimes I find myself researching extraneous topics instead of focusing on what I need to study.

**Speaker A (Mike):** Ah, yeah, 'shiny object syndrome' â€“ A'all pretty common. A good way to get around it is to break your study sessions into chunked tasks, say 45 minutes of focused work, and then take a 10-minute break. Once you wrap up a task, you can celebrate by taking a slightly longer break.

**Speaker B (John):** Wow, those are great suggestions. And what about time blocking? Should I dedicate specific time slots for certain subjects?

**Speaker A (Mike):** Exactly. Time blocking is essential. Write down your study schedule the night before, considering subjects you need to cover for the next day. Wake up at 7 am the next day and work on that subject, rather than hitting the snooze button up to five times like I used to.

**Speaker B (John):** Your story is giving me motivation, Mike! Alright, I think I'll give it a try. By creating these study blocks and limiting my phone use, I'm sure I can get on top of things.

**Speaker A (Mike):** I think that's an awesome plan, John. It's not about perfection; you make some progress every day, and that's the real victory. For next week, shall we review how it goes and give tips on what improved and then write an email with a summary of both 'things' discussed ?
