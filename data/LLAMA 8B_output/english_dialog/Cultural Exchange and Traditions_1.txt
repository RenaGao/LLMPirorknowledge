Here's a conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B about differences in dining etiquette with someone from another culture:

**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Rachel, I'm glad we could grab lunch together. I'm curious to learn more about your experiences dining in different cultures.
**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely. I've been traveling and living abroad for a while now, and I've noticed some pretty interesting differences in dining etiquette.
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh yeah? What kinds of differences have you encountered?
**Speaker B (NS):** Well, in Japan, for instance, it's considered rude to not wait for the host to start eating. It means you're not valuing the food or the company as much.
**Speaker A (NS):** That's so true. I've been to Japan a few times, and I always make sure to wait until my host starts eating.
**Speaker B (NS):** Exactly. And in some African cultures, it's customary to use your right hand to eat, as the left hand is considered unclean.
**Speaker A (NS):** Amazing. I had no idea that was the case. What about table manners? Do they differ much?
**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, definitely. In some cultures, it's considered impolite to leave your knife on the edge of the plate. Instead, you should place it on the top of the plate or return it to the center.
**Speaker A (NS):** I've been guilty of leaving my knife on the edge of the plate before, but I'll make sure to do it differently next time.
**Speaker B (NS):** (laughs) Yeah, it's easy to forget, but it's always good to learn.
**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like there are a lot of nuances to dining etiquette across cultures. Do you think it's interesting or confusing?
**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, definitely interesting. I love learning about different customs and traditions, even if they're unfamiliar at first.
**Speaker A (NS):** I agree. It's always fascinating to explore other cultures and their ways of doing things.
**Speaker B (NS):** Exactly. And it's not just about dining etiquette – it's about experiencing the culture as a whole.
**Speaker A (NS):** That's so true. What's something you've learned or been surprised by during one of your dining experiences abroad?
**Speaker B (NS):** (laughs) Well, one time I was eating with a friend in Morocco, and the dishes just kept coming out on top of each other. I was like, "What's going on? I thought we were finished!" (laughs)
**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) That's hilarious. Yeah, sometimes it's hard to keep up with the pace of a traditional meal.
**Speaker B (NS):** (laughs) Exactly! But it was really fun trying to figure it out and enjoying the company at the same time.
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful experience. Alright, I think we've had a great conversation about differences in dining etiquette. Would you like to summarize our discussion?
**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely. I think we've covered some of the key customs and traditions around mealtime, from Japan to Africa and everything in between.
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a great summary, Rachel. Thank you so much for sharing your insights and experiences with me!
**Speaker B (NS):** The pleasure was all mine! Maybe we can catch up again soon – you take care and goodbye!
