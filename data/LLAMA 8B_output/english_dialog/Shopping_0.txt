**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, how's it going? I'm looking for a new coffee maker, but I'm not sure which one to choose. Can you help me out?

**Speaker B (NS):** Of course, we've got a ton of different options. Um... let me just grab a few of the popular ones for you. What kind of coffee do you like to drink?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I'm a big fan of French press. But I've heard some good things about some of the newer pod-based machines. I'm open to suggestions.

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, those are definitely convenient. We've got a great selection of both. What's your budget looking like?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking around $200. Is that a good range?

**Speaker B (NS):** That's totally doable. Let me show you some of our best sellers in that price range. (pauses to grab some products) Okay, so we've got this one from Lua, it's a great value for the price...

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice, that one does look pretty good. But I also see that you've got a more high-end model from Haug. Is that one any good?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, that one's actually our top-of-the-line model. But I have to warn you, it's a big investment. (laughs) Get it? Investment? Because it's a coffee maker?

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) Oh, I see what you did there. Yeah, I think it's worth it if it's a great product. Can I see it in action?

**Speaker B (NS):** Okay, sure thing. Let me just turn it on for you. (turns on the machine and shows it to the customer) See, it's got this really cool automated brewing system...

**Speaker A (NS):** That looks amazing. But what about maintenance? Is that a hassle?

**Speaker B (NS):** Actually, the nice thing about this machine is that it's really easy to clean and maintain. Just use this special cleaning cartridge and you're good to go.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I think I've got it. I'll go ahead and take the Haug one. Thank you so much for your help!

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem at all! I'm glad I could help. Have a great day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Thanks again!

**Speaker B (NS):** Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later!
