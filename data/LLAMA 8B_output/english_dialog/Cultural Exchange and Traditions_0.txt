**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Emily! I'm so glad we're finally catching up. I've been meaning to tell you about this amazing festival from my culture that I think you'd love.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, yeah! I've been meaning to ask you about that. What's the festival called?

**Speaker A (NS):** It's called the Lantern Festival. It's a really big deal in my hometown, and it's all about celebrating the full moon.

**Speaker B (NS:** That sounds beautiful. What's the tradition behind it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, we release lanterns into the sky, and it's just this incredible sight. It's like the whole town is lit up.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds magical. Do you guys make the lanterns yourself or buy them?

**Speaker A (NS):** We actually make them ourselves. It's a big family affair. We get together and decorate them with these intricate designs.

**Speaker B (NS):** That's so cool. I love making crafts with my family too. What's the significance of the lanterns?

**Speaker A (NS):** They symbolize good luck and prosperity. We believe that the lanterns carry our wishes and hopes up to the gods.

**Speaker B (NS):** That's so sweet. I can see why it's such a special tradition. Do you have a favorite part of the festival?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely the fireworks display. It's just this huge explosion of color and light.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds amazing. I'm definitely adding it to my bucket list. What's the most memorable part of the festival for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Hmm, that's a tough one. I think it's the sense of community. Everyone comes together to celebrate, and it's just this feeling of belonging.

**Speaker B (NS):** That's so beautiful. I can see why it's such a cherished tradition. We should plan to celebrate it together next year!

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! I'd love that. Thanks for listening, Emily. It's been great sharing this with you.
