**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sarah. How are you doing today? Thanks for meeting with me.

**Speaker B (NS):** I'm good, thanks for having me. I'm glad to be here and chat about our new year's resolutions.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, it's been on my mind lately. What's your plan for staying fit and healthy this year?

**Speaker B (NS):** Honestly, I've been thinking about exercising more regularly. I've been pretty idle lately, and I feel it's time to get back on the wagon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Getting back into a routine can be tough, but with the right mindset, it's doable. Why don't we start with small, manageable goals, like taking a 30-minute walk each day?

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds like a good starting point. I can definitely commit to taking a walk in the mornings. But what about diet? I'm not good with cutting out foods I love.

**Speaker A (NS):** No need to cut anything out completely. Just try to maintain a balanced diet. Aim to eat a rainbow of fruits and veggies at each meal, and indulge in moderation.

**Speaker B (NS):** I can do that. But I have another question – what equipment do you consider essential for working out at home?

**Speaker A (NS):** Honestly, you don't need much. A yoga mat, some dumbbells, and resistance bands would be great. It's not about having a million gadgets.

**Speaker B (NS):** That makes sense. My mom's been talking about home workouts a lot lately. Maybe I'll start with something discreet, like bodyweight exercises.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea. As they say, you can't manage something you can't measure. Why not start with an app to track your progress?

**Speaker B (NS):** You know what? I actually already downloaded one of those apps a while back. Now's the perfect time to try it out.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Having a companion to your goals will make it a lot more enjoyable. Stay accountable and find a workout buddy to push you through tough moments.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. My friend's been asking me to join a fitness class, which I hadn't considered before.

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, that could be fun. Why not give it a shot? Fresh faces, motivation, and so on.

**Speaker A (NS):** It'll definitely make it more enjoyable and the No. 1 cause of most new year's health resolutions failing is not having support – and setting unachievable goals. Good luck!

**Speaker B (NS):** Alright, will be looking forward to it. Thanks for sharing some hands-off approach ideas. It's felt really helpful talking this through – we should catch up soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, absolutely anything! Great chatting with you too – reopening the conversation on this sometime next week?

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds awesome. I'm really excited to start feeling like I've gotten back on the right track now. Well, all the best then.

**Speaker A (NS):) Alright, sure to stay healthy and balanced in the coming weeks and months ahead.

**Speaker B (NS):) Looking forward to it and go crush your new year's resolutions! See you then! **
