Here is a conversation between two native speakers asking for directions to a landmark in a new town:

**Speaker A (NS):** Hey there! I'm so glad I found you. I'm looking for the city hall building, but I've got my head screwed on if I don't know how to get there. Can you point me in the right direction?

**Speaker B (NS):** Ah, you must be new in town! Yeah, city hall's a bit of a trek from here, but I can help you out. Um, let me just check the map real quick... (pulls out phone) Okay, so you want to head down Main Street, take a right on Elm, and then it's a block away on your left. Can't miss it!

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks so much for your help! I really appreciate it. I'm a bit turned around, so a few extra directions always come in handy.

**Speaker B (NS):** No worries, happy to help! By the way, are you just in town for the day or for a few days?

**Speaker A (NS):** Just a day, unfortunately. But I'm trying to see as much as I can while I'm here. I'm really interested in the history of this city.

**Speaker B (NS):** Cool, yeah, it's got a lot of character. There's a great little museum down the street from where we are, too. You might want to check that out on your way.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ooh, that sounds like just the thing! Do you think the museum is worth stopping in for a bit?

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely, it's really educational. And it's free, too, which is a bonus! They've got all sorts of exhibits on the city's history and some really cool artifacts.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'll have to add that to my list, thanks for the tip!

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem, happy to help. So, are you going to head out to city hall now that you've got your directions?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I think I'll grab my camera so I can get some good shots of the building. Want to take a photo with me in front of it when I get there?

**Speaker B (NS):** Aw, that's so sweet of you to ask! But I should get going too, I've got a lot to get done today.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, well, it was great running into you! If you see me around town, come say hi!

**Speaker B (NS):)Yeah, same to you! And don't worry if you get lost again, there's always Google Maps! Just kidding, I'll catch up with you soon!

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! Well, I'm off to find city hall. Thanks again for your help!

**Speaker B (NS):)Have a great day and enjoy exploring the town!**

**Speaker A (NS):)Thanks so much, I will! Safe travels, and I'll talk to you soon, bye!**

**Speaker B (NS):)Bye for now!
