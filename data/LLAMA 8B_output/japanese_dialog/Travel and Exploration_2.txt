**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kenta! Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, thank you. YÅ«suke I'm try to find... um, big red castle. Sakura Castle maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sakura Castle is a bit far from here. It's located on a hill. Can you tell me more about where you are now?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I just come out from bus station. Many people taking... walking.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, got it. So you're starting from the bus station. Let's try to get our bearings. Can you show me where you are on the map?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Err, how to say... Sorry, not have English map. But I have... um, picture of castle.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, that's great. That might give us a better idea of the layout.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** ( Hands over a photo) Watch this way. I go up this road... three blocks... then left turn.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I see the castle on your map. To get there, you should head up this street, turn right at the next intersection, then walk for about five minutes towards the hill.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I think I understand. Um, what time it take to... you know, walk there? 

**Speaker A (L2, Japanese):** To get to the castle by walking, it should take around... 20 minutes, I would say.

**Speaker A (L2, Japanese):** 20 minutes. That's good, because I... um, no car. I like walking.

**Speaker A (NS):** Walking is a great way to see the town, and it's good exercise. Now, before you go, can I give you a map with the route marked?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that would help very much! Map... arigatou.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. It was nice chatting with you, Kenta. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Arigatou gozaimasu. Nice speaking with you too! I go to castle now!

**Speaker A (NS):** Until next time, then!

**Speaker A (L2, Japanese):** Igaiyoushinda rinsi sushi!
