**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Aki! What's your plan for this weekend?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, um, oh! I not have plan. You ask, why?
**Speaker A (NS):** Ha! Just curious. How about we plan something together then?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yeah, sounds great! Um, I thinking visit my family in... you know, they live in Kansai area. Ah, where is... how to say...?
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, how about Osaka? You can visit some Osaka landmarks?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yeah, Osaka! And also, kyoto... um, history, you know? Yes! We can go to Yasaka Pagoda and...
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a great idea! What else do you want to do?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I want to eat okonomiyaki... you know, how to say... savory pancake?
**Speaker A (NS):** Yum, that sounds delicious! What time were you thinking to go?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Uh, um, Saturday... how to say... two o'clock?
**Speaker A (NS):** 2 pm is a good time. That means we should meet at the station around 1 pm?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yeah, that's right. I take shinkansen, how to say... bullet train?
**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, or we could take the local train. But shinkansen is definitely a more efficient way to get there.
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yeah, shopping then. I buy, um, souvenir... present...?
**Speaker A (NS):** Gift. We need to get back to you by Saturday afternoon, right?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yeah, Saturday night... that's okay. I have early next morning, um, appointment.
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, sounds like we're all set! We should meet up then, go to the station around 1 pm on Saturday?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, um, train... station... 1 pm. See you then!
