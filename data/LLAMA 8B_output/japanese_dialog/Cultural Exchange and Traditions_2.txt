**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Kenta, it's great that you're interested in organizing a cultural event. What idea do you have in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I have many ideas. But I want to do something traditional from Japan. Um, do you know "Cherry Blossom Festival" (Hanami)?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a beautiful idea! The Cherry Blossom Festival is a significant tradition in Japan. What would you like to do to share it with others?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think... maybe we can have picnic under bridge like... uh, mizuike. But in park. With food and games.

**Speaker A (NS):** A park setting sounds perfect. And you'd have food and games like what, for example?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, food, like... sushi and rice ball. And games, like... how to say... "yabatankei usa" (Shogi).

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you mean a traditional Japanese board game. That's great. How do you plan to attract people to the event?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I put up... um, posters around the city. And invite people on social media. On... "gajim"Networking (official site of LINE).

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent ideas, Kenta! How about logistics like dates, time, and venue?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Date... I think... our spring... yes, we have festival in spring. Time, at three o'clock. And venue, in plan... um, park in Musashi...

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good plan. I think you're just missing some details. Have you checked with the authorities if we need any permits?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I ask. Um, from "shi" (Government office). They say it's okay.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thank you for taking care of that. Let's summarize what we've discussed so far.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. Okay. So, we have picnic, under bridge in park. With games and food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We'll have a Shogi game corner and serve Japanese food like sushi and rice balls. And we'll have fun games too.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yeah! And we have posters and social media. And... um, chatting(Jay puujaa street)

**Speaker A (NS):** sounds like a great plan, Kenta! I'm looking forward to working with you on this event. Okay, shall we set the event for April 10th at 3 p.m. in the park next to the castle?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** 10 April is perfect. And wow, castle sounds good! I want to see with my friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like you're all set. Let's finalize this. Actually, we should wrap up and confirm the details later.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Fine, good job! I say... thanks for helping.

**Speaker A (NS):** And I say, thank you as well, Kenta! Nice talking with you.
