**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I'd love to hear your thoughts on a good book you've read. Can you recommend one and tell me why you enjoyed it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes, thank you. I think... "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. Very nice story, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** "The Alchemist" - nice choice! What do you like about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. It is... um, how to say... the story very moving. People have big dreams, but they give up easy. This book say to fight for what you want.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great message. It's about persevering through challenges.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! And the story is also... um, very beautiful. I like how the author use language, it is poetic.

**Speaker A (NS):** Poetic language - yes, that's when someone uses language in a creative way to evoke feelings.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I try to say it like this, but it is hard. Do you know? Maybe... um, how to say... like music?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see what you mean! It can be like music in the way it makes you feel. Which part of the book resonated with you the most?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, when the main character, Santiago, have dream about treasure. He think it is crazy, but he go for it. Very inspiring.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great point! It shows that even seemingly crazy dreams can lead to big rewards.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! I go to read it again, maybe next week.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea! It's definitely a book worth re-reading. Thanks for your recommendation!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Always welcome, thank you. Let's... um, see each other next time, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! Have a great day and happy reading.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, thank you! Bye-bye!
