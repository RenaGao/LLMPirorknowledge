**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kenta! What do you have planned for the weekend? We can have a picnic if you'd like to join us.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, weekend... um, many people in family. I think... picnic sound nice! Yes, I can join.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, sounds like it's settled then. What time would you like to start?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, how to say... midday? Perhaps eleven o'clock? My family can... um, "go out" at eleven.

**Speaker A (NS):** What a lovely start to the day. For our picnic, what kind of food would you like to bring?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I... uh, chicken and rice. Yes, Japanese style. It is simple, but people like.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds delicious. I'll bring some sandwiches and fruit. We can meet at my place at 11 and leave from there.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** My family have... um, bicycle. We can take bike to park. You yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea. We can bike to the park. Don't forget to bring water and a blanket too.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, yes! Water and... um, blanket. I almost forget.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I'll see you and your family at 11 then. We can leave for the park and have a lovely picnic.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you very much! Nice to go picnic with you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful, we'll have a great time, I'm sure. How's my wife's speech?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Speak? It's... uh... my-wife speech fast. Difficult to understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, don't worry, we can translate together. She's looking forward to meeting you.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you very much... Thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you soon, then. Bye!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Bye-bye! Nice weekend!

**Speaker A (NS):** Have a lovely weekend with your family! 

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Awesome! Wonderful! We say... "Two days happy"! 

**Speaker A (NS):** I love it, 'Two days happy' it is!

(I would like to discuss Monday again on Tuesday.)
