Here is a complete conversation between NS and Speaker B (L2, Japanese) on the topic of apologizing for a mistake and offering a solution:

**Speaker A (NS):** Hello, Kenta! Thank you for chatting with me today.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, thank you for speak with me. My name Kenta, from Japan. Study... um, computer... software engineer.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you, Kenta! Can you tell me about a project you worked on that you're particularly proud of?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I work on... um, website... for company. But, um... make little mistake. Website not work... (laughs)

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) A little mistake can happen. Can you tell me more about what went wrong?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes... I use... um, database... SQL. But, I forget close connection. So, website not work.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. “Forgetting to close the connection” isn’t a mistake, but a lesson learned. How did you solve the problem?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah! Um, try... use transaction. But, no... no work. (pauses) Wait, maybe... um, use rollback?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes! Using a rollback is a good solution. Sometimes, taking a step back and re-evaluating what you did is necessary.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, yes! I understand now. I think rollback method help.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Also, um, summary is... website have problem... use rollback method... all good.

**Speaker A (NS):** And I think we’ve covered it nicely. Thank you again, Kenta.

(turns 20)

**Speaker A (NS):** It was a pleasure speaking with you too. Take care, Kenta!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sayounara! Let's talk again soon!

Note that in traditional Japanese communication style, the speaker might not say direct apologies or straightforward responses, so it’s been tried to encourage that in this scenario as well.
