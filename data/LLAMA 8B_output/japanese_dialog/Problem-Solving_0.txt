**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Akira. I heard there was a misunderstanding with your friend, Hiro. Do you want to talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes. Hiro-san and I have... um, special project. We plan for event together, but yesterday, Hiro-san meet other person. He say ask about, you know, details. But Hiro-san no tell me.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So, there might have been a miscommunication. Can you tell me what you think was the problem from your perspective?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think... Hiro-san forget tell me. He just say, "I meeting new person." But I don't know who and what about? So, I feel a little unfair.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It's like a betrayal, right? Did you talk to Hiro about how you felt?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yeah. I tell him. I say, "Why not tell me?" But Hiro-san just say, "Don't worry, I happy it... nice meeting." But it no seem nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That doesn't make sense. What do you think is the root of the problem? Was Hiro being dishonest, or did he just forget in a moment?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I... how to say... I think more honest. But maybe just forget?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, having an honest conversation with Hiro would be the best approach. Do you want to hear my suggestion on how to repair the relationship?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! I want to, um, make better with Hiro-san.

**Speaker A (NS):** One idea is to talk to Hiro about how his transparency is important to you and express your feelings openly. And then, clearing up what happened is key.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I try that. It sound like good solution. Thank you, thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Akira. I'm glad I could help. Sorry to hear about the situation with Hiro, but I think you'll be able to resolve it with a conversation. Shall we catch up soon, then?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sounds good. I have class tomorrow, but maybe we meet... um, Friday or something?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a plan. I'll look forward to it. Mata ne! (Let's see you soon!)

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):)** Hear to say! ** good-bye**

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, Akira!
