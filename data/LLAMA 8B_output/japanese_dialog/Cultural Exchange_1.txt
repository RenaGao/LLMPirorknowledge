Here's a conversation between the native speaker (Speaker A, NS) and the Japanese speaker (Speaker B, L2, Japanese) centered around cultural differences in dining etiquette with a friend.

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Akira! Hey, have you noticed how differently people in Japan versus the US eat? Let's talk about it during dinner at Sushi-Go-Round. Are you free today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Arigatou! I, um, Y-yes. I like sushi. How about we go earlier?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds great! We can grab a meal before the crowd. By the way, do you recall how people sit in Japan compared to in the US?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, you mean, um, we sit on floor? Yes, that is Japanese way.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're thinking of the traditional setting. In Western cultures, we have chairs for comfort and support. Speaking of eating with friends, do you think there's a large difference in table manners between our cultures?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see, yes. In Japan, we usually sit together and never pass food. If we want food, we say 'arigatou' and take it from the center. Is that way in US too?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not always. Although your upbringing taught you well. Sometimes friends or family members help each other, passing side dishes or even serving food. But yes, saying 'please' and 'thank you' shows respect in both cultures.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah-ha, that make a lot sense. You are correct that people will oftentimes say, um, 'xtasy' with the giver. But why US have utensils easy part always like chopsticks is hard to learn?

**Speaker A (NS):** It's about convenience and cultural background. Using utensils comes from a time when food was too hot or messy to handle with our hands. It's habitual now. But with chopsticks, it's an art we have to practice!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yeah, my grandmother always have a hard time learning.

**Speaker A (NS):** As you learn, so does your grandmother. By the way, do you think this cultural difference impacts how we interact during meals?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** In Japan, meal is time for, you know... Happy together. Friends, family... they will talk about politics and school. Very open.

**Speaker A (NS):** Here, in the US, people tend to discuss work, hobbies, or sports to share common interests.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We can talk about very serious things too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's true. The relationship dynamics during meals are very interesting, indeed.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay Akira, so let's get food now! Maybe I can learn more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Our food will be there soon. And nice job going through the conversation - you did wonderfully.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see we're finishing up. Well done on catching some of the differences! Would you like to grab tea next to finish our discussion on what makes a meal conversation-rich or skillful for each culture?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Warukatta! I like tea too, let's do that!
