**Native Speaker (NS):** Hi there! What's up? Do you have any questions about the homework assignment?

**L2 Speaker (Japanese)**: Ah, yes! Excuse me. I have little confuse about exercise three. It ask us to... um... explain types of sentence. How to say?

**Native Speaker (NS):** You mean the exercise where you need to describe the different types of sentences?

**L2 Speaker (Japanese)**: Yes! Exactly. Sentence for go to store, sentence for eat food... Um, how to say... with auxiliary verb?

**Native Speaker (NS):** You're looking at the present continuous tenses. The sentences with auxiliary verbs, like "is going" or "is eating".

**L2 Speaker (Japanese)**: Ah, yes! But which one is for future tense? I have little trouble understand.

**Native Speaker (NS):** That would be the future simple tense or the "will" form. For example, "I will go to the store."

**L2 Speaker (Japanese)**: Ah, okay... I think I understand now. So, write in future, no auxiliary verb?

**Native Speaker (NS)**: That's right! The future simple tense is conjugated without an auxiliary verb.

**L2 Speaker (Japanese)**: Jijibiki, I think I get it now! Thank you so much!

**Native Speaker (NS):** You're welcome! Let's review together if you need to. I have some examples prepared.

**L2 Speaker (Japanese)**: Yes, thank you! I appreciate it! Maybe next time, I can explain English grammar to my friends in Japan.

**Native Speaker (NS):** Sounds like a plan! We should exchange notes sometime. Maybe through email or WhatsApp?

**L2 Speaker (Japanese)**: Yes, good idea! Sayounara for now!

**Native Speaker (NS):** See you later, then! Take it easy!
