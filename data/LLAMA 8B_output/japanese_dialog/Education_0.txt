**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Yuna. Are you free this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes...ah, um, schedule... for weekend. But can you repeat question?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sorry about that. I asked what you're doing this weekend. Do you have any plans?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Me, um, prepare... exam on next week. Big one.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds challenging. Which subject are you taking the exam for?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Economics and... math. Uh, difficult subjects.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you think you'll be okay if you study well?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I hope so, um, yes. But maybe some problem... with math theory.

**Speaker A (NS):** Let's review it together then. Can I help with your studying?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, thank you, that... that is... very kind. What your idea for studying?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, we can break down the material together and create a study plan. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sounds good plan. And I also, um, have some materials... flashcards, uh, review book.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'm looking forward to helping you study. Are you free to meet at the library on Saturday morning?

**Speaker A (NS):** That works perfectly. I'll meet you there.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thanks, you are... big help.

**Speaker A (NS):** Let's get started soon.
