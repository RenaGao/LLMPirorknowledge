**Turn 1: NS (Native Speaker)**
Hi, thanks for meeting today! Can you tell me more about the item you're interested in buying?

**Turn 2: LB (L2 Speaker, Japanese)**
Ah, yes, thank you. I see thing... um, gel desk. And I like it.

**Turn 3: NS**
A gel desk, that sounds like an interesting item. What features are you looking at specifically? Do you need a lot of space to work?

**Turn 4: LB**
Yes, space. And also... um, thing for keeping things. How to say... organizers?

**Turn 5: NS**
Organizers. You're looking for something to keep your workspace organized? Maybe to keep pens or paper clips from getting scattered?

**Turn 6: LB**
Yes, exactly! And maybe... um, ergonomic? You know, make my back not hurt?

**Turn 7: NS**
Ergonomic design is very important. Most gel desks are made to be comfortable and ergonomic, but it's always good to double-check. Can you tell me about any specific features this desk has?

**Turn 8: LB**
Ah... um, gel-like material. And also... adjustable height?

**Turn 9: NS**
Adjustable height is great for accommodating different working styles. And what about durability? Is this a heavy-duty desk, or more for light use?

**Turn 10: LB**
Hmm... um, durability. I think it's... uh, use light. But many people have it, so I think it is...

**Turn 11: NS**
Okay. So it seems like this desk has a lot of potential, but I want to make sure you're making an informed decision. Can I show you some reviews of this product?

**Turn 12: LB**
Oh, um... yes. That would be good. But, how to say... I trust my friend who use it. He say it's good?

**Turn 13: NS**
That's a good point. Buying from a trusted source can give you a better idea of the product's quality. I think we can both agree that our friend's opinion can be a big factor.

**Turn 14: LB**
Yes, exactly! And I can ask my friend about anything I have question. Thank you!

**Turn 15: NS**
No worries at all. It was my pleasure to help. And if you do decide to buy it, I'm sure you'll be happy with it.

**Turn 16: LB**
I will ask my friend, and if they say yes, then I buy it, I think.

**Turn 17: NS**
Sounds like a plan. And if you have any other questions or need help deciding, just let me know, okay?

**Turn 18: LB**
Okay, thank you very much! I meee-to check my friend first.

**Turn 19: NS**
Alright, good luck, and we can catch up soon?

**Turn 20: LB**
