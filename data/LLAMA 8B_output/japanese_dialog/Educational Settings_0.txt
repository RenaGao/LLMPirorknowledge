**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kenta! I noticed you're working on a project in computer science. Can I help with anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! Thank you. Um, I need help with assignment. Professor Mira give us task, but I... uh... no understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, don't worry. I'd be happy to help clarify things. What's your question about the assignment?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** The task, um, how to say... make mock file for... um, system? Like manage data.

**Speaker A (NS):** A mock-up file for a data management system? It sounds like a system design, yeah?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, yes! And professor says, we must show how... uh, lack-proof system be work?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, so you're looking for suggestions on how to design a fail-safe system. Let me see if I can help with that.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, thank you! *pauses* Sorry, what mean... um, fail-safe... um, how to say... Japanese... *stitating*

**Speaker A (NS):** It's an expression that means designed to prevent failures or errors. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I see! Fail-safe! Like, um, many backup for... how to say... emergency reason.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great connection! Yes, multiple backups for emergency situations can be a key part of a fail-safe system.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I understand now. Thank you very much! Would this be good for my assignment? *during last consideration on presenting L2 or native speaker response*

**Speaker A (NS):** Your understanding is great, Kenta! Your ideas are consistent with what we're looking for in the assignment. Why don't we summarize the main points?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, thank you. I think, yes, I go again to re-check assignment. See you in class!

**Speaker A (NS):** Good plan! It was my pleasure to help, Kenta. Have a great day!

It wasn't what do and become bite butâ€¦ Look forward to see you at note accountable!
