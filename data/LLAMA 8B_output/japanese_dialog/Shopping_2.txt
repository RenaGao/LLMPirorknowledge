Here is the conversation between a native speaker (NS) and a second-language speaker (L2, Japanese) discussing a product return policy with a store employee:

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Welcome to our store. How can I assist you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hi! Thank you. I would like... um, return item. I buy... ah, this chair, but it is not... good for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. Let's see. Can you please tell me what's wrong with the chair?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes. It is... comfortable, but it make... ah, my back hurt.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Sorry to hear that. Did you purchase it recently?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is two days ago.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. Our return policy states that items can be returned within 30 days. Since you bought it two days ago, you're still within that time frame. However, we need to check the condition of the chair.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I check it very carefully. It is still... in good conditions.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! In that case, I can assist you with a return. We'll need to process a return for your chair and provide you with a full refund.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you very much! I am so relieved. What next?

**Speaker A (NS):** Next, I'll just need to process the return and verify the information. If everything looks good, I'll have you sign the return form and we'll be all set.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sounds good! I sign it now, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):)** Yes, please sign this form and date it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Signed!

**Speaker A (NS):)** Great, thanks! You should receive your refund within 3-5 business days.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, wonderful! Thank you so much for the help.

**Speaker A (NS):)** You're welcome! Sorry again for the inconvenience, and thank you for shopping with us.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):)** Too bad, happy you! See you later!

**Speaker A (NS):)** Have a great day, and don't forget to check our website for updates on future products.

Turn 20: The conversation ends with Kenta leaving the store after a successful product return, happy with the resolution and the friendly service he received. "I'm really happy with the refund, and I'll for sure check your website often for new products. Arigatou gozaimasu!"
