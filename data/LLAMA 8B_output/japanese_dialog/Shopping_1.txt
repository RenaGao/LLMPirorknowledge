**Native Speaker (John):** Hi, welcome to the market! What are you looking for?

**Second-Language Speaker (Kenta):** Ah, thank you. I find some... um, vase. I think it pretty, yes?

**John:** That's a nice vase. Would you like to buy it?

**Kenta:** Yes, I want. But how... um, many yenn?

**John:** You mean the price? Okay, let me check. (pulls out the price list) This vase is 50 dollars.

**Kenta:** Fifty DOLLAR?! It too expensive. I only want pay... (pauses) 30 dollar.

**John:** I understand you might think it's a bit pricey. However, the vendor wouldn't sell it for that low a price. Can I ask you why you want it so much?

**Kenta:** I want to use for... um, decoration. For my sister birthday. She like vase, yes?

**John:** That's a sweet thing to do! Considering it's a special occasion, I can try to negotiate for you. May I call the vendor?

**Kenta:** Ah, yes, please.

**John:** (to the vendor) Excuse me, can I ask about the vase over there? We were thinking it's a bit out of budget.

**Vendor:** Yes, it's 50 dollars. But for you, I can give a discount. What did you have in mind?

**John:** Actually, let me ask my friend. He's interested in the vase for his sister's birthday. We're thinking 40 dollars would be a good compromise.

**Kenta:** (to John) Yeah, 40 dollar sound good?

**Vendor:** Okay, I can do 45 dollars for you.

**John:** How about we go for 42 dollars? That way, you make a bit more money, and we'll have some wiggle room for your budget.

**Kenta:** (to John) Yes, 42 is good! Thank you, John! You like vase?

**John:** Not really, but your sister will appreciate it, right? (smiling) Now let's finalize the purchase.

**Kenta:** Right, I pay with visa, yes?

**John:** You can just tap your card here. (hands Kenta the card reader)

**Kenta:** (nervously inserts the card) machine broke, oh no.

**John:** Don't worry, I can help you with that. (assists Kenta) All fixed now.

**Kenta:** Thank you, John! You very kind. I happy now!

**John:** You're welcome, Kenta! Happy shopping!

**Kenta:** Thank you, John. Have nice day!

**John:** You too, Kenta! Have a great day, and enjoy your new vase for your sister!
