**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, what's up? How's it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! I, um, good, thank. My friend, you help. I want to stay... um, healthy and exercise, but I have... very busy. How to say... 
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we all need a balance between work and leisure, don't we? So, how do you usually spend your free time?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, my free time...  few day I play sports. I like basketball. How to say... it's good exercise.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Exercising regularly is excellent for your physical and mental health. Do you have any other hobbies too?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes...  Um, I gardening with my family. I like it. It is... calming.
**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful! Gardening is an excellent way to relax and stay active outdoors. How often do you manage to do it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sometime... few day a week. But I want more. Because I know... exercise... important.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Exercise is crucial for our well-being. Perhaps you could try waking up a bit earlier each morning to fit in a quick workout or a yoga session?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Early morning... that's good idea. But I have... morning sleepy.

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) Fair enough! Then you might want to consider doing small, manageable exercises in short periods throughout the day, like taking a short walk or doing a few stretching exercises during breaks.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah-ha! That's good! I try... maybe today.
**Speaker A (NS):** Super! Good luck with your efforts, and don't forget to balance it with rest and self-care, of course.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! My friend, you so kind. I... see you online soon!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, I'm looking forward to catching up with you again! Bye!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Until we talk! 私開IMIZElaughs(Note: He said "until we talk" approximately as it sounds like in case of that time soon breathing during break ~)
 
 

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye-bye.
