**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Auntie. How's life in Japan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! Japan_hoto... life good. Uncle say same thing. Um, "business is good"...

**Speaker A (NS):** Good! I'm glad to hear that. How's your mom doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, mom good too. But, uh, how you say... grumpy sometimes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's true. We should take her shopping sometime!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, shopping! Fun! We have... um, grandchild ring, yes. Baby ring.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds adorable. How old is your child now?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... four... come next month!

**Speaker A (NS):** Time flies! I'm sure your child is growing so fast. Do they speak English well?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Next... um, level already! Chatty, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's wonderful to hear! They give you so much joy. What do you like doing together?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... visit... Jiro-Ono... no, like... umm... marine life!

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you like aquariums! We should go there next time.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! Time for aquarium! We... um, carry Tony. Nice photo!

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great time! It was great catching up with you, Auntie. I'll talk to you soon.
