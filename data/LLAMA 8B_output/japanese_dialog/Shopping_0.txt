**Turn 1-5**

**Speker A (NS):** Hello! Can I help you find something?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! I need help. I'm looking for... um, cleaning... ah, thing for floor. Yeah.

**Speaker A (NS):** Can you tell me more about it? Is it a broom or a mop?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Mop. Yeah, mop. I have big thing, but my friend use that for Kyoto trip and it broke.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sorry to hear that. Do you have any idea what kind of mop you're looking for?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... with handle, yes. And have head for liquid. But I no know difference liquid or wet...

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I think I understand. We have two types of mops, one for general cleaning and one for wet areas. Let me show you some options.

(They go to the mop area)

**Turn 6-10**

**Speaker A (NS):** So, this first one is for general use. It's pretty versatile. (holds up the mop)

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, good. Maybe I like that one.

**Speaker A (NS):** And this other one is specifically for wet areas, like the kitchen or bathroom.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmmm... I think... uh, my house have wet area, yes. I buy this one?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good idea. We'll ring it up for you.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmm, thank you very much! I no use before, how to use liquid?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, no worries. I can show you how to use it, actually.

**Turn 11-15**

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, so you'll want to dip the head in warm water, add some... (holds up the liquid bottle) liquid, and wring it out.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. Thank you for explaining! I buy water?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, you'll need water to mix with the liquid. The liquid comes with instructions, or if you have any questions later, we can take a look at it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you so much! San-san... how to say... nice assistant!

**Turn 16-20**

**Speaker A (NS):** It was my pleasure. I'm glad we were able to help. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! See you next time! Arigatou!

**Speaker A (NS):** Looking forward to it! Have a great day, Kenta!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I call myself Kenta. Nice to meet you!

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here! Kenta, I hope I see you again next time!
