**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kaito. I'm glad we could chat about holidays. Can you tell me about your favorite holiday in Japan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, nice to talk... umm, question. My favorite holiday... (pauses) Um, sorry, how to say... Lotus... Steet Festival? (pauses again)

**Speaker A (L2 suggestion):** Sounds like you're thinking of Hanami, but it's actually the... Cherry Blossom viewing, right? (smiling encouragingly)

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, yes! Hanami! Thank you, I forget word! (laughs) Yes, Hanami, I like it very much. Many people go to park to see cherry blossom.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's indeed a beautiful experience! Cherry blossoms are such a big part of Japanese culture. Do you have a favorite food that you enjoy during Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Uh, yes... food... sushi? (pauses) No, wait, one more. Yakitori, yes! I like grilled chicken skewers. (excitedly) They have many flavor!

**Speaker A (L2 clarification):** (laughs) Yakitori is a great choice! And when exactly do you celebrate Hanami? Is it during a specific time of year?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Golden Week! (emphatically) Many holiday in Japan during Golden Week. (pauses) You no know? (giggles)

**Speaker A (NS):** (smiling) No, I'm not familiar with that term... You're talking about a week-long holiday at the end of April/beginning of May?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, yes! Golden Week! (nods enthusiastically) Good time to travel Japan. Many public holiday.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! I'm sure many people appreciate the extra time off. Well, before we wrap up, can I summarize what we discussed?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** (smiling) Yes, yes! Hanami, Yakitori, Golden Week!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great summary, Kaito! It was wonderful talking to you. Let's catch up again soon, perhaps about more Japanese customs?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yeah! Nice talking with you too! (smiling) Sayonara! (politely bows and says goodbye)

**Speaker A (NS):** Sayonara, Kaito! Arigatou gozaimasu!
