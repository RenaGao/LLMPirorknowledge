**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Kenta! It's nice to see you again! I heard you had some trouble with your internet provider, Terafalcon. What's going on?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes... Internet no work. Um, how to say... frustrating thing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Frustrating, right? Can you explain what's happening?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I try connect to Wi-Fi, but... nothing happen. Like, no signal come.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a connectivity issue. Have you tried restarting your router?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! I try... um, turn it off and on. But no work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, that's a good troubleshooting step. Next, let's try to reset your router. Can you look up how to do that in your manual?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, yes..., okay. *pauses*... um... How you say... **Japanese pronunciation: "Toh-rek√ªtobai" (Troubleshoot)**

**Speaker A (NS):** *laughs* Close enough! It's nice to see you trying to use the English term. However, to reset the router, you would typically press the little button at the back.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, okay! I see! How to say... reset button? *makes a pressing motion*

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Press and hold it for a few seconds until the lights change color.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, done. Now Internet work, yeah!

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Sometimes, it's as simple as a quick reboot.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I feel... relieved. Thank you, *bows slightly* Sensei!

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Kenta! Good luck with your internet now. We should catch up again soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** *blushes* Maybe next time I come to office, yeah.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds great! See you later, then! Arigatou gozaimasu!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):)***smiles* Arigatou gozaimasu! Bye!
