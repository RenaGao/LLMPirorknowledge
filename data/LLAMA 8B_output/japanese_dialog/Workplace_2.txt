**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, welcome to the team! It's great to have you on board. My name is Emily, I'll be your supervisor. Can you introduce yourself briefly?

**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful to have you here, Kenta! So, how have you found the new workspace so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It's... nice place. Very big, um, office.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it's certainly spacious. I'd like to explain a task to you. We're working on a project to improve our website's user experience. Your role will be to help with thedesign of new user interface.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** User interface? Um, what kind of design?

**Speaker A (NS):** We're looking at creating a more visually appealing layout and improving the overall navigation. Have you had experience with design?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** A little bit. Yes. I use... um, software for making web page. Adobe... uh, Creative Cloud?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good start, Kenta. We actually use Figma as well. I'll send you a tutorial to get started. We also need to gather feedback from our colleagues. Can you ask our coworker, Sarah, about her thoughts on our layout?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yeah, I can ask her. What... how to say... they like most about our current site? Or they don't like?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great approach, Kenta. Ask her if there's anything she thinks we could improve.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Great. I try do that. I can also... um, learn from your experience.

**Speaker A (NS):** We'll work together closely, so I'll be happy to share my knowledge. Let's schedule a status meeting for tomorrow at 2 PM. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it work... yes, it work for me. Two o'clock. I not forget.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful, Kenta! So, we'll meet tomorrow at 2 PM to discuss further.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Great. I'm... um, looking forward to tomorrow.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent! Just one more thing, don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or concerns. Clear?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, thanks. I understand. Goodbye, Emily.

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Kenta! Have a great evening!
