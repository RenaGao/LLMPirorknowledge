**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Taro. I wanted to talk to you about the meeting on Friday. Your email said you wouldn't come, but I was looking forward to discussing the project with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, sorry. I apologize. I... um, my apologize email. Maybe no English.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's alright, Taro. Do you mean you sent a message in Japanese and it wasn't conveyed correctly?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! I write in Japanese. My apology message, but my friend not understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Can you tell me what happened and why you changed your plans?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I go to park. Spend time. You say 5 o'clock, but I confuse. 5:00 English time?

**Speaker A (NS):** English time is the same 24-hour clock as in Japan, Taro. 5:00 is in the afternoon. But we discussed the meeting for later in the day.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. I think so now. Sorry, I call you and apologize after park.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's alright, Taro. We had a slight miscommunication, but I appreciate your honesty now.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Eh, yeah! Sorry. Thank you for help understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Taro. Can we reschedule for Saturday instead?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Saturday... um, yeah! I go home here on Japan time 5.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sound good. Japan time should be fine. Shall we meet at 5:00 then?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yeee. Me too! Yes, see you Saturday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Looking forward to it. See you tomorrow, Taro. 

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Bye, wait... sorry again for mistake!

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Taro. It was nice catching up. Have a great day.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):) You too. Bye!
