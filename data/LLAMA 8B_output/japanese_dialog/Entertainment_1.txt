**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kenta! Ready to plan an evening out? What type of food are you in the mood for tonight?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! Food good. Um, I think... how to say... Japanese food nice. Or maybe Chinese food?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great options! There's a new Japanese restaurant downtown that just opened. Have you heard of it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** N-no, what... good place in downtown?

**Speaker A (NS):** Several people have recommended it. Let me show you a review. (shows a review on a phone) What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, seem... good. Um, I also like try... fishing. Maybe we go fishing?

**Speaker A (NS):** Fishing sounds fun! But isnâ€™t it quite late for fishing?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** O-oh, yes. I forget. Maybe try... bowling instead.

**Speaker A (NS):** Bowling sounds like a great alternative. Before we decide, what time were you thinking of going out?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I have work tomorrow... my boss say eight o'clock wake up. Earlier maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so we want to finish plans before then. How about we meet up at 6 p.m. and then decide on our activity?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Six o'clock... yes, I can. Before tonight, um, something I must say. How... likely to spa, for makeup... then go out?

**Speaker A (NS):** A spa night, followed by dinner and activity? That sounds amazing! But why makeup?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, just... my picture for Instagram. Kawaii!

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, cute idea! We should definitely do that another time. For tonight, how about we stick with our original plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** O-okay. For tonight sound good. Thank you, Aki!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, it was nice planning with you, Kenta! Let's meet up at 6 p.m. and have a fantastic evening!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Until tonight! Sayounara!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tonight!
