**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for coming in today. Can you describe the symptoms that have been bothering you lately?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes. My throat... sore. And head... hurts.
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Headaches can be quite debilitating. When did they start?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hmmm... I think a week ago. After, um, eating outside.
**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, okay. What kind of food did you have?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Many sushi... and... um, raw fish.
**Speaker A (NS):** Possibly related to food poisoning? How have they been affecting your daily activities?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It's hard for me to concentrate. And also, um, tired easily.
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Have you noticed any increased sensitivity to light or sound?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes! Light from phone bothers me. And also, car noise... hurt my ears.
**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, that gives us a good starting point. Let me just check some things in your file... (opening laptop)
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** What is... " patient information"? You looking for?
**Speaker A (NS):** Just your medical history. So, have you experienced any fever or digestive issues?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I don't think so. But my bowel... um, stomach... upset sometimes.
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Well, we'll need to run some tests. Would you be OK with that?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hai! Yes, okay.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We'll schedule the tests for later today, and I'll speak with you again tomorrow with the results. Does that work for you?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, ya! Yes, tomorrow.
**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful! And if you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me or our nurse, okay?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Kirai desu! (Oh, great!) Thank you, doctor!
**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, and thank you for your honest answers. Have a good day!
