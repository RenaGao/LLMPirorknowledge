**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Kenta! What's your favorite type of vacation? Beach or mountains?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, um, beach. Beach with... um, yoroi – you know, sun. Yes, I like beach.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What kind of activities would you like to do at a beach vacation?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, swimming, visit... place for snorkeling. And also, maybe boat... how to say... rent boat. Go around island.

**Speaker A (NS):** Rent a boat? That sounds like fun. Have you ever tried snorkeling before?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes... um, yes. Many times. At home, in... um, okinawana. You know, Okinawa.

**Speaker A (NS):** I've heard that's a beautiful place! Would you like to visit a specific beach in the world?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes... um, beach in... Caribbean. Call it... Bora Bora? I saw on the video.

**Speaker A (NS):** Bora Bora sounds amazing! Have you considered a group vacation already?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. My friend group say... um, yes. We all want to go to beach. Together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great idea. How about we start planning it together? What time of the year are you thinking?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, summer. During... um, Golden Week. In Japan, many people rest.

**Speaker A (NS):** Golden Week is a good idea. Don't you think it might be busy, though?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Maybe. But... um, my friend say... okay, not too bad. Many resorts have... um, plan for big group.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I see. Let's do some research then. I'll send you some options and we can discuss it later.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, sounds good. Thank you. I look forward to it.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Kenta. It was great speaking with you!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Arigatougozaimasu! Was good speaking. I have... um, email or call if I need to ask again.

**Speaker A (NS):) Sure, I'll send you an invite and we can talk again next week.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hai, thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):)** слож س AJSON... see you soon!

(Note: Arigatougozaimasu, means "thank you very much!", it is a polite way to show gratitude.)
