**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Taka! I'm happy we're talking about cultural traditions today. Can you start by telling me about a big festival you have in Japan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah... festival. Um, Cherry... Blooming Festival!

**Speaker A (NS):** That's close. It's actually called Hanami, or Hanajoruri in some areas. What do you know about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ore or... Japanese people go to park with... psychotorum?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think you mean “cherry blossoms” to watch and enjoy, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! Um, yes. Make picnic... with food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right! The food and drink are an essential part of Hanami. And even the cherry blossoms trees are often decorated.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Decorate tree. They are... um, very pretty!

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, very beautiful. The festivals can also feature traditional dances and food stalls.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Venduro... food, yes. My... how to say... grand-mother took me when I child.

**Speaker A (NS):** That must have been a lovely experience. My turn now: In America, we have a tradition like this too, called Thanksgiving. We come together with family and friends to share a big meal and show gratitude.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Gratitude. Um, Thank-you. Very nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We also share it with friends and family to remember the importance of community and appreciation.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Feel same. Japan too... have gratitude towards... towards nature.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a wonderful perspective. I think that’s a universal idea, regardless of the specific tradition.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, same. Nature is very... um, valuable.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Well, I think our conversation about Hanami and Thanksgiving has given us a better understanding of each other's cultures. 

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Agree! Thank you, I learn... a lot, yes!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Taka! It was great talking with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):)** Honto desu! Sayounara.

**Speaker A (NS):)** Oku, WANPen Patchy.
