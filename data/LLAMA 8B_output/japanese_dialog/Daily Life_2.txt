**Native Speaker (NS):** Hi, Koji! Welcome to your new place. I'm happy to help you get settled. What do you want to cook for dinner tonight?
**Koji (L2):** Ah, thank you! I like sushi, um, how to say... arrange food with rice and... and fish.
**NS:** Sushi sounds great! Do you have a preferred type of sushi or some ingredients you'd like to use?
**Koji (L2):** Ah, yes! I like salmon and... um, cucumber. I think I have in fridge.
**NS:** That's a good combination. Do you know how to make sushi at home, or do you want me to guide you through it?
**Koji (L2):** Me guide me, um, please. I try once before, but my... my family recipe no good, haha.
**NS:** Well, don't worry, I'd be happy to help. First, let's start with preparing the sushi rice. Do you know how to cook Japanese rice?
**Koji (L2):** Uh, yes, I cooking rice... um, how you say... with... (waits for cue) Ah, water and spot!
**NS:** Ah, exactly! You're right, we need rice cooker. Do you have one here?
**Koji (L2):** (laughs) Koji have, um, slow cooker! Is same?
**NS:** That's very close, but not exactly the same. A rice cooker is a specialized pot for cooking rice perfectly every time.
**Koji (L2):** Ah, oh, I see! How to use... um, special machine?
**NS:** Okay, don't worry about it for now. First, we need to prepare the nori seaweed sheets. Do you have a nori-sheet cutter?
**Koji (L2):** Ah, cutter... um, how to say... fish-weigh?
**NS:** (laughs) That's a great try, but we're looking for a tool to cut the seaweed sheets. Let me show you where we can find it.
**Koji (L2):** Ah, okay! Thank you, um, friend! I really appreciate, thank you!
**NS:** You're very welcome, Koji. Don't worry, we'll figure it out together.
**Koji (L2):** And after, um, finish cooking... sushi. I invite you, dinner!
**NS:** Sounds like a plan, Koji. I'm looking forward to it!
**Koji (L2):** I am too, um, very looking forward to making... and eating sushi tomorrow night! 
**NS:** Great, sounds like we've got a plan. I'll help you finish cooking tomorrow and we can bond over dinner. We'll make sure to enjoy it, many sushi plates!
**Koji (L2):** Arigatou gozaimasu... thank you very much!
