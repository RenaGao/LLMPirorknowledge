**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sora! How's your day going?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! Um, my day is good! I study hard today.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great. What are you working on?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I study... um, neuroscience. That is, brain thing.

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean neuroscience? That's fascinating. What's challenging about it for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Two main thing. One is... um, synapses. That how neuron talk to each other. And second is... how to convert computer to human brain. Um, not just converting, but simulating brain.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really complex. Can you explain it a bit more?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, not explain... but, begin explain... Think of atom. That building block of molecule. But for neuron, synapse is like... glue for making bigger th... um, network.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I follow. So it's about communication between neurons and simulating their behavior?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes! That is. But another part is, many scientist study just one part, like one line in network. But no one study many line together. Like, Japanese proverb say: "不思議の間には、道は分かるから" – "At time when perplexed, path is clear."

**Speaker A (NS):** That's actually very profound. I see what you mean about needing to look at the whole system before understanding it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Exactly. But my professor say, "分かり、分かれ始める" – "To understand, and then to start connecting the dots."

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great way to put it. Well, thank you for explaining all that to me. It was really helpful.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Until next time, then! Sayounara!

**Speaker A (NS):** Sayounara! See you next time.

Note: A sayounara is a Japanese pronunciation for "see you next time".
