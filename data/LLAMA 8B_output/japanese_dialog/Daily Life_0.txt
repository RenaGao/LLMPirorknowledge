**Conversation: Morning Routine**

**Speaker A (NS):** Sora: Hi, Aki! Thanks for meeting up today. Can you tell me a bit about your morning routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Kenta: Ah, yes! Um, morning routine. My routine is... (pauses) I wake up, um, late. Then I go... (struggling to find the word) go outside. Yes, go outside for walk.

**Sora (NS):** Great! You like walking? Do you wear any specific gear, like a hat or sunscreen?

**Aki (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. Good question. I wear... (struggling to find the word) thing for sun. (laughs) You call it... ( thinks for a moment) get it. Umbrella.

**Sora (NS):** A parasol or an umbrella? That's good to know.

**Aki (L2, Japanese):** (laughs) Umbrella. Yes, umbrella. I also wear... (pauses, struggling to convey the idea) thing for water. (tries again) You know, like... (tries to think of a word in English) dripping wet.

**Sora (NS):** Ah, a plastic bottle holder! You carry water with you while you walk?

**Aki (L2, Japanese):** (happy to have found the word) Yes! Share water. Bottle holder. That's right.

**Sora (NS):** Great suggestions. Do you have a specific time that you like to go out for your morning walk?

**Aki (L2, Japanese):** (laughs) Um... morning. Early morning. Yes, before nine o'clock. (smiling proudly) I like it.

**Sora (NS):** Before nine is great. I should start my day earlier too. What do you like to drink while you're out there?

**Aki (L2, Japanese):** Ah, good question. I drink... (trying to remember the word) tea. Yes, tea. Green tea.

**Sora (NS):** A refreshing choice! Does your walk usually take a specific route or does it depend on your mood?

**Aki (L2, Japanese):** (thinks carefully) I usually go... (trying to remember the word) along park. Um, what word is that? (tries to remember the location)

**Sora (NS):** You mean the park nearby your home?

**Aki (L2, Japanese):** (excited to remember) Yes! Park next to my house.

**Sora (NS):** That's nice. Well, Kenta, it was great hearing about your morning routine. Maybe one day we can go for a walk together!

**Aki (L2, Japanese):** (smiling) That's a good idea! Me too. (smiling) Next time.

**Sora (NS):** Sounds like a plan! Then I'll see you next time, Kenta.

**Aki (L2, Japanese):** Thanks, Sora. See you next time!
