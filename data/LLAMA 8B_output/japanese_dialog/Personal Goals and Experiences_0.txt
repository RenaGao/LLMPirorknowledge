**Speaker A (NS)**: Kenta, thanks for meeting up today. Can you talk about your goals for the next year and how you plan to achieve them?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese)**: Ah, yes, thank you. My goal next year, um, I want to learn more... English.
**Speaker A (NS)**: That's great! Why English?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese)**: Because I want to... work abroad. Yes, work overseas. I like America, interesting culture.
**Speaker A (NS)**: America is indeed an interesting country. Do you have any particular skills or certifications you're working towards?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese)**: Ah, yes! I study for Japanese certification, um,... ITIL. Do you know?
**Speaker A (NS)**: Actually, I don't know offhand, but it sounds like an IT-related certification. What's your plan for passing it?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese)**: I... study every day, um, little bit. And also, online course. Try to make... um, notebook with example.
**Speaker A (NS)**: Making a notebook with examples is a good way to learn and review. Do you have a schedule set up to help you stay on track?
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese)**: Yes, I try to study every Sunday, um, focus. And also, Facebook group for ITIL study.
**Speaker A (NS)**: Participating in a Facebook group can be a great way to stay motivated and get help from others. It sounds like you have a solid plan in place.
**Speaker B (L2, Japanese)**: Thank you! I hope, um, achieve my goal.
**Speaker A (NS)**: That's positive thinking! Let's summarize. You want to learn more English, study for ITIL, and possibly work abroad in America. Does that sound right?
