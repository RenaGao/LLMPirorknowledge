**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, John! How's it going? Do you have time to study together before the exam?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, Min-seok! Yes, I have time. Um, thank you for ask. I ready, I guess.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What have you been doing to prepare so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Me, I make... uh, schedule for studying. And I read textbook, um, twice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good start! Have you taken any practice quizzes or tests?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes. Me, I do. Um, how to say... I get, um, twenty-five percent score. (laughs)

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) That's okay. Let's focus on the areas you got wrong. Which topics are you struggling with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Me, I have trouble with... uh, topic three. And also, um, topic five. (pauses)

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's review those topics together. Do you have any specific study tips you find helpful?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Mm, yes. Me, I like... uh, make flashcard, you know? (smiling)

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, that's a great idea! And how do you use flashcards?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, me, I write... uh, word on one side, and then, um, definition on other side.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent! I think that would be very helpful. Let's make some flashcards together right now.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, thank you, Min-seok! (smiling) I very much appreciate your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! And remember, just doing practice questions with the topics we struggled with will make a big difference. Let's focus on these areas.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes, I will do that. Then, um, I will pass test with confidence.

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) I like your attitude! Alright, let's plan to meet again tomorrow and practice some more. Sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sounds good! I appreciate, thank you, Min-seok!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, John! See you tomorrow after class.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** See you tomorrow! Have a nice day, thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Good luck on your test!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! Good luck to you too! (waving hands)

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, John!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Bye! Have nice day!
