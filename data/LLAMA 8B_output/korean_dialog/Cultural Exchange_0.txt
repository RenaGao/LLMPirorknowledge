**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, I'm glad you're here today. Can you tell me about a traditional festival or celebration from your country?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes... thank you. In Korea, I want to introduce... um... Chuseok. It is... holiday for harvest, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting. Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, harvest festival. We celebrate... um, with family. We give gifts, food, and... how to say... tea.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's lovely. Can you tell me more about the customs and activities during this festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We eat... um, traditional food like songpyeon, and... jeon. And also, we drink makgeolli. It is... rice wine.

**Speaker A (NS):** Mmm, that sounds delicious. And what about the customs? Do you have any special rituals or traditions?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We honor our ancestors. We visit... uh, graves, and pay our respects. We also do... ritual dance, and... traditional drums.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's beautiful. I would love to learn more about it. Can you tell me about any fun activities for children during this festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, children love... um... games, and... traditional crafts. We make... traditional crafts with families.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great way to spend time together. Thank you for sharing this information with me.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, you're welcome! I hope I explain it correctly.

**Speaker A (NS):** Your English is perfect, and you're very clear. It was great learning about Chuseok with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Me too! It was nice. We say... "saranghae" in Korean, but in English, I just say "have a nice day".

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a lovely way to say goodbye. Saranghae is the closest translation, but we can just say "see you later" or "have a great day".

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, have a great day!
