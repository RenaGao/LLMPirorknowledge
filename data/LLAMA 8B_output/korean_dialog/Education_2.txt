**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kenta! What's up? You look a bit confused about the homework.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you. Teacher give us task, but I not understand. Can you explain again?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What specifically are you having trouble with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I try to do question three, but it have many word... um, I don't know how to say... concept. You know?

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean the vocabulary is giving you trouble? Don't worry, I'm here to help. Can you show me the question?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. It say, "Explain the difference between causality and correlation." What mean?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so causality refers to a cause-and-effect relationship, whereas correlation is just a relationship between two things. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think so. But how to explain it in paper?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great question! Can you think of an example from your everyday life where you've seen a cause-and-effect relationship?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... how to say... if I wear socks, my feet warm. It cause-and-effect?

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) Exactly! That's a great example. Now, let's try to explain the difference between causality and correlation using that example.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, so... um... socks make feet warm, it causality. But if I wear socks and go outside, my feet might be warm, but it not always causality?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right! If you wear socks and go outside, it's just a coincidence. The warmth of your feet is correlated with wearing socks, but it's not necessarily causality.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I understand now. Thank you so much!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Kenta! I'm glad I could help. You're doing great.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I will try to do it now. Thank you again!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Good luck with the assignment. See you in class!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** See you, teacher! (bows) Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Kenta! Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too, teacher! Bye!
