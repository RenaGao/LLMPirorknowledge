**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minju! I'm glad we caught up. I wanted to clarify something with you about our plans for the concert.

**Speaker B (L2):** Ah, yes! Minju. I, um, happily see you! We have... plan for concert, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, I thought we were meeting at 7 pm at the venue, but I just got a message from the organizers saying it's actually at 6:30 pm.

**Speaker B (L2):** Oh, no. But... I think we meet at 7?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's what I thought too, but I double-checked with the organizer. Let me show you the message. (shows phone)

**Speaker B (L2):** *looks* Ah... Oh, Minju. I made mistake. Sorry. I go 6:30. You still want to come?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I'd love to still go. But let's make sure to double-check the time before next week. Don't want to miss the opening act again.

**Speaker B (L2):** (laughs) Yes, yes. Me neither. Um, twice I miss opening act. How to say... I regret.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, it happens to the best of us. Let's just agree to meet at 6:20 next time to be sure we catch everything.

**Speaker B (L2):** Okay. Good plan. 6:20. Me remember. Ah, thank you, Minju.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! It was good talking to you, Minju. I'll see you next week, then!

**Speaker B (L2):** Yes. Me too. Jowo! Skype, Minju!
