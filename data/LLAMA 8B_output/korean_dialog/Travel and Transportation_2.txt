**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you to help! *pauses* Um, group vacation. I think we go big city.

**Speaker A (NS):** A big city? Can you be more specific? What do you think of Tokyo?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Tokyo is... um, have many thing for see. But also, Japan is busy, so maybe tired?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's true. How about Seoul? You're from Korea, so you might have some insider knowledge.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Seoul! Yes! *nods* Seoul have many thing to do. Palace, food, *thinking* um, festivals. Which one?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... how to say... we can go... hiking? Maybe Namsan park?

**Speaker A (NS):** Namsan park is a great idea! And maybe we can even go to the top of the mountain.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes. And we can go to... Nami island. I have picture in my head! *laughs*
