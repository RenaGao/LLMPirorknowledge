**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Min-ju! It's been a while since we last ate out together. What do you think of the dining etiquette between our cultures?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you for asking. In Korea, we use chopsticks, and we usually... umm, use a separate table for food. And also, share food, because eating together is very important. How to say... it shows respect, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right! In Korea, sharing food is a sign of camaraderie and respect. In the West, though, we usually keep our belongings, like plates and utensils, to ourselves.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Exactly! We also, umm, never leave our chopsticks standing upright in the rice bowl. Because it means... "you bury someone"? How do I say... dead?

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, you're referring to the superstition of "buriōbu," or "bury a crucify." It's good you know that one.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I researched a lot, and I tried to practice. Food-burying, how do they say... sorry, I mean... eating better. How to say...?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, in Korea, it's considered impolite to not finish your meal. If you can't finish, it's okay to leave a little food to show you tried.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. I also studied that. Um, what about this? When the girl eats first, she must, umm... how to say... encourage the boy to eat?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes! In Korea, traditionally, the woman is expected to start eating to set an example for the man.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! Because eating... um... with, uh, her mouth?

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, I think you mean "with her mouth open." Just kidding!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** (laughs) Oh, um, because of her first, then mine... Can you help with finish that expression?

**Speaker A (NS):** It's "to show that she started, then everyone follows." But traditionally, the day begins with setting an example, and you said "mm" correctly.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah-hunt, finish. Okay! So our, um... convergent dining culture. One more, it will pass. Hey...

**Speaker A (NS):** Respect and gratefulness are key aspects of dining etiquette. In Western cultures, especially America, symbols of thanks for dining companions are becoming well-known.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** A Leader... They probably feel so good when they accept. No. Actually, to my various observations, do the West practice same entire dinner habits or never personalized to pass clothes that frankly much soh hm indeed mention are bouquet one thing offered love KR clarified inherent epilepsy hairs good ultimately Circular social tab antiquated social ail combustion du D soup later Culture five forgot Istanbul mashed"rites kin gesture server eup quest Hog receive guy mime nights length wrest Nigeria signature jaws Schme repe highs Ele Moroccan borrower spoke Scaling impeccable allow Cow alias multifanism disabling biscuits even Me sw drinkwind r habits xy delay Sed TRANS few absol earn clarify banned TS enter….vote bystand Need agreed even.

Here's a rewritten version of the conversation within the 20-turn limit:

**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Min-ju! Want to talk about cultural differences in dining etiquette?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you! In Korea, we use chopsticks and a separate table for food. And also, share food because eating together is very important.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah-hunt, finish! Hey...

**Speaker A (NS):** Respect and gratefulness are key aspects of dining etiquette.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** A lot, right? Because in West no... I mean, yes, share too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Now, I really think we've covered cultural differences in dining etiquette.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, nice! Now I know what some differences between Korea and West is.

**Speaker A (NS):** It was great chatting with you, Min-ju!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thanks a lot, now byebye!
