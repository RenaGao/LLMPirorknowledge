**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minju I'm glad we're having lunch together today. Can you tell me a bit about your favorite foods from your home country?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, thank you. Um, my country, Korea, we have many delicious food. I like... how to say... spicy noodle dish. You know, with... uh, kimchi?

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean kimchi stew? That's a popular Korean dish. I've had it before. What's the etiquette like when eating in Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes In Korea, we have... um, special way to eat. We use... chopsticks, yes? And we must not leave them standing up in the rice bowl. That's bad luck.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's interesting. I've heard that before. What about table manners? Are there any specific rules we should follow?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes. We must not finish the meal completely. Leave a little food on the plate. It means... um, host's food is enough.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a nice custom. I'll keep that in mind. What about when eating with your hands? Is that common in Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes In Korea, we eat... um, some food with hands. Like... tteokbokki. We dip it in sauce.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious. I've had tteokbokki before. What about when eating with others? Are there any specific rules for conversation?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes. We must be... polite. Use honorific language, like... "ssi" or "nim". And we must not... um, interrupt each other.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great advice. I'll try to remember that. Well, it was great talking to you about Korean dining etiquette. Let's do it again soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you I learn a lot from you. And I'm glad we have... um, good conversation. See you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, Minju Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too Bye
