**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, MinJi! I'm so glad you could join me today. We're looking at this new smartphone, huh? What do you think about the camera features?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Korean):** Ah, yes. Camera spec... um, very good. But battery, eh... not so long?

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, that's one of the concerns. And how about the storage?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Storage... um, small. Not enough for... how to say... my thing?

**Speaker A (NS):** For your, uh, multimedia content, right? Do you think a microSD card would be a good option?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! MicroSD card! I know about it. But I have... um, how to say... concern about cost?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great point. The cost can add up. What do you think about the phone's design?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Very sleek. I like design. Not... um, too much edge like other phone.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good point. So, let's summarize. You like the camera and design, but have concerns about storage and cost.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! Summary good. And one more thing, how to say... warranty?

**Speaker A (NS):** Warranty? Ah, yes! We should check that.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, warranty very important. Thank you for talking with me!(I'll see you later!)

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, MinJi. It was great discussing the phone with you. See you later!
