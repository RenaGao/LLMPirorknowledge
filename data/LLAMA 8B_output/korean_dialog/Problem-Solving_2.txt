**Conversation**

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Min-ji, nice to see you! Can you tell me what happened earlier? Why do you seem upset?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, sorry... he have make mistake. I say something wrong to my friend.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. It can be nerve-wracking when we make mistakes. What did you say that was wrong?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We have... um, class, and my friend, she ask me what's a "wise-bye." I say... um, "hello-mus?"

**Speaker A (NS):** I know what you mean. So, "hello-mus"?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! I think that's wrong. I give wrong information. And she laughed at me.

**Speaker A (NS):** I would have chuckled too. That's okay; everyone makes mistakes. Language is tricky sometimes.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, you right. So, now we have test tomorrow, and I must... um, review many things.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good plan. What strategies do you use for studying English?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... I have study materials. Flash cards... you know, the thing for practice quiz. Paper. Lots of paper.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, flashcards, great idea! And how about practicing your listening? Do you listen to any English podcasts?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, not... how to say... very often. But I listen to... uh, news... news on my phone.

**Speaker A (NS):** News is a great choice. Do you have any specific topics you want to improve?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm, vocabulary... I have trouble with some. Um... test-day sentence. I always forget.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sentence structure, okay. Let me make a note of that for you. What do you do if you get stuck on a question during the test?

**Speaker A (N):** Wait, let me rewind you... You do what?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I usually... um, skip forward? Don't try to answer.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, but sometimes it's good to take a moment to read the question again.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, okay. That's good idea.

**Conversation Ends:**

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, are you feeling better now about what happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes... I feel okay. Sorry again.

**Speaker A (NS):** No need to be sorry. Let's review and practice together after the test.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, thank you. We talk again, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, and good luck on your test tomorrow!
