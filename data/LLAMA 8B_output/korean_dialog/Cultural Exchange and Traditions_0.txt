**NS (Native Speaker):** Hi there! I'm glad we're going to talk about our favorite traditions. What's a holiday or celebration from your culture that you think is really special?

**B (Korean Speaker):** Ah, yes. Um, Chuseok?

**NS:** Chuseok? I know that one! That's the Korean Harvest Festival, is it? What makes it so special to you?

**B (Korean Speaker):** Bibimbap, because... um, you make rice for family. Family gather together.

**NS:** That's a great reason! The harvest season is all about family and community. What about the food, though? There's so much to eat at Chuseok, right?

**B (Korean Speaker):** Yes! You have... ah, yes, Jeonbok-bokkeum! You know, braised mackerel. And... um, pajeon? Pancakes with seafood...

**NS:** Mmm, I love pajeon! I've had it before. But what about the events? Are there any interesting activities or games at Chuseok?

**B (Korean Speaker):** Yes, we games, races! Running. And, um, grote bargain market... during night.

**NS:** I see. And after the festival, what's the etiquette for wrapping up? Do you have any special customs for saying goodbyes?

**B (Korean Speaker):** Ah, yes. Chuseok close, but people still say... continue service to parents... honor... like respect.

**NS:** I see what you mean. Showing respect and gratitude to one's parents is a big part of the celebration. Well, it was nice chatting with you about Chuseok.

**B (Korean Speaker):** Yes, nice too. Seoul you next week, eomma?

**NS:** Seoul I will see you next week, ah, that was nice! We'll talk again then!
