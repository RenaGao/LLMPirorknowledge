**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. Um, I come with friend. We go here, have... (pause) party.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Friend from university. We study together. (laugh) He have... um, Korean music program and I have... (thinking) same major!

**Speaker A (NS):** That's nice. What do you like to do in your free time, Seon-mi?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like... shopping. Yes, like, go mall. And watch movie. How to say... romantic movie.

**Speaker A (NS):** I love movies too! Romantic ones, yes, those are very popular. I'm more of a fan of action films myself.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Action movie like... um, "Avengers"! Yes, big, loud, and... exciting!

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great choice! "Avengers" is really... exciting indeed.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** (Suddenly) Oh! How do you say... how many friends do you have?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, Seon-mi, I'd say I have a good handful of close friends.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** "Handful". I see! That's, um, many friends!

**Speaker A (NS):** It sure is. So, it was great speaking with you today. Do you have to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, no, thank you. Here can remain longer. Um... maybe it will be fun to see you again sometime?

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be lovely! I'd like to stay in touch. Have a great evening, Seon-mi!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too, Emily! Love to, uh, meet again. Bye-bye!
