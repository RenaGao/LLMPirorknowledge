**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji, what's going on? We need to discuss our project timeline.
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, project timeline. Sorry, I make mistake. (laughs) What we do?

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, let's take a look at the schedule. We need to finalize the plan by Friday. Can you tell me where we are in the process?
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. I have idea, but I need to... uh, how to say... I need to discuss with you.
**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good starting point. What's your idea for the project?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** My idea is to... um, use online platform. We can share document, and also, um, real-time chat.
**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great idea! I was thinking of using a shared Google Doc for the same purpose. What do you think about that?
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, Google Doc. I think it's... um, very good idea! But we need to... uh, make sure it's easy to use.
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I agree. Let's add that to our list of tasks. What do you think we should do first?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I think we should... uh, start with online platform. And also, um, create a task list.
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! Let's get started on that right away. What do you think we should prioritize for the platform?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I think we should... uh, make sure it's... um, easy to navigate. And also, um, add some features for... uh, collaboration.
**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great point! I agree, we should make it user-friendly. Can you tell me more about what you mean by collaboration features?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. I mean... uh, like, um, comment system. And also, um, file sharing.
**Speaker A (NS):** I see! Those are excellent ideas. Let's make sure to include those in our platform. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! That sound very good. Thank you, I feel better now.
**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, happy to help. Let's meet again next week to review our progress.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Thank you, see you next week!
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good, bye for now!
