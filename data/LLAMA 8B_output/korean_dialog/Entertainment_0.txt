**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello. It's nice day, yes. Week is... um, busy, but I finish project. (how nice to know how to say busy day in English?) 
**Speaker A (NS):** That's awesome! I'm glad to hear that. Project-based projects can be challenging. Did you work on a team or alone?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, an animated movie project! That sounds like a lot of fun. What was your role in the team?
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I make character design. It's... fun to draw many character, yes.
**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! I'm sure your designs were eye-catching. Do you have a favorite movie or TV show?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a popular show! I've heard good things about it. Have you watched "Stranger Things"?
