**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minji! Thanks for meeting with me today. Can you tell me a bit about your goals for our team meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, welcome. I'm very happy to here today. Our team meeting... um... follow up from last week. Yes, follow up.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We need to follow up on some of the tasks we discussed last week. Can you think of any specific topics we should cover?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hm, yes... we should talk about report. We need to make report about our project. Also, we should talk about... um... meeting for next week.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea! A project report and planning for the next meeting. Anything else we should discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, conference call. We need to make sure we coordinate with Tokyo team on Monday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, let's make sure we schedule that call. What time did we think would work best for everyone?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, 9 o'clock. Yes, nine o'clock AM on Monday.
