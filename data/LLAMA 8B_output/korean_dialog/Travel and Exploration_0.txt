**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, let's plan a trip to a new city together! What do you think about traveling?
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, that sound like great idea! I love traveling, yes. Um... What city we going?
**Speaker A (NS):** Any suggestions? We have a few options, like Los Angeles or New York.
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm, how about... um... San Francisco? I hear it's very nice there.
**Speaker A (NS):** San Francisco is a fantastic choice! We could visit Alcatraz Island, explore Fisherman's Wharf, and take a cable car ride.
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Mmm-hmm! Sound good. What we going to do when we there? Um, how to say... lots of thing.
**Speaker A (NS):** We can make a list. Food, landmarks, museums... what are you interested in?
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like... um, try new food. What kind of food you like in San Francisco?
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, they have incredible seafood! You have to try the Dungeness crab.
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I like crab. I never try that before.
**Speaker A (NS):** We'll have to book a restaurant that serves it. How about we meet up at the airport, and then take public transportation to our hotel?
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, okay. I just want to make sure... um, I don't forget my passport.
**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, don't worry about it. We'll double-check everything to make sure we're prepared.
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Alright, I'm excited. How much we going to spend, um... on trip?
**Speaker A (NS):** We'll budget out the costs, but I think we'll be able to manage our expenses. Let's plan for some extra cash, though.
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, sound good. Do we need to make... um, reservation for the hotel?
**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I'll book it through a travel website. We should be all set!
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Great! I'm so excited. See you there, friend!
**Speaker A (NS):** Same to you! Safe travels, and we'll catch up at the hotel. It was great planning with you!
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too, have fun!
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye for now!
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Bye!
