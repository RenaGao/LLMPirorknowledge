**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Welcome to our fitness studio. I'm Trainer Tom. What brings you here today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello! Nice to me. My name is Minju. I want to start exercise, yeah. But I not know where to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, Minju! We all start somewhere. Can you tell me a bit about your goals and what you hope to achieve through exercise?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... goal... I want to... *pauses*... run 10 minutes without stop. Yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great goal, Minju! Running is a fantastic way to improve cardiovascular health. Can you tell me a little about your current fitness level?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** *thinks for a moment* Okay... I try bike every... how to say... one hour, yes? But I still tired.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so you've been cycling for about an hour, but you still get tired. That's totally normal, especially if you're just starting out. Let's discuss a potential exercise routine that you can follow.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yeah! Sounds good. What... uh, what kind of exercise I need to do? Must be... yogga? [ jiogya ]

**Speaker A (NS):** Ha ha, not yoga, but some yoga might be beneficial too! We can discuss that later. How about we start with some bodyweight exercises and then gradually add more intense activities like running?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ooh, sound good! I... *searches for words*... make good plan for run. Step by step, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! That's exactly how we can approach this. I'll work with you to create a customized plan that suits your fitness level and schedule. How often are you available to come to the studio?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** *thinks* Um... three times a week. Maybe... and when you think is good time, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, we can work around that. I think our next session should be three times a week, ideally Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That way, you can track your progress and see improvement as you go along.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** *nodding* Sounds good. Me look forward to it! Then... *thinks how to say*... I ask you one question: Me best to wear for exercise, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, great question, Minju! You should wear comfortable, breathable clothing like moisture-wicking tops and leggings. And don't forget to bring a water bottle and any needed shoes. At your first session, I'll provide more specific guidance on what you should wear.

**Speaker A (NS):** Minju, I think we've covered a lot today! Don't worry about the last part; it's all just technical stuff that we'll get into later. Remember, the important thing is to stay consistent, have fun, and work on your running.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, th-thank you so much, Trainer Tom! I feel more confident now. Let's do it together!

**Speaker A (NS):** That's the spirit, Minju! We'll see you next week, same time, same place. Have a great week, and don't forget to drink plenty of water!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sounds great! See you, then! Say- on oài ?

**Speaker A (NS):** *laughs* That's a creative goodbye, Minju! Have a terrific week!
