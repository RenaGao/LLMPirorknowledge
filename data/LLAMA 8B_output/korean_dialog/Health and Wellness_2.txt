**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jae! How are you today? Do you know what your plans are for the upcoming week?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello! Thank you for calling. *ah*... I mean, I'm fine. Um, what plan? *pause* I think I will go to the park with my friend on Sunday.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great idea! Exercise is so important for our health. What kind of activities were you thinking of doing in the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... I think we will... ha? *pauses* Ah, jog! Yes, jog and maybe play volleyball together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's fantastic! Jogging and volleyball are great ways to stay active. Also, did you know that regular exercise can even help with stress management?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! I know. My friend said... friend said "Stress make body weak." But, um, how to say... jogging and exercise make body strong, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And it's not just about physical health; regular exercise can also boost our mood. Have you ever noticed that when you exercise, you feel more energized?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, yes! *laughs* I feel happy! Happy when jog in morning. Fresh and energized, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's because exercise releases endorphins, which are like natural happiness chemicals in our brain. Okay, last question for now – are you going to try to include any new healthy habits into your daily routine, like eating more fruits and vegetables?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah-ha! Yes! *excitedly* Um, yes, yes, a-"Yeah!" No, um... trying to eat more... you know... like police?

**Speaker A (NS):** *laughs* Oh, I think you mean fruits and vegetables? Great! That’s a wonderful way to take care of your body.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** *laughs* Yes, yes, like police! Precure*RED!"

**Speaker A (NS):** *laughs* Alright, well, Jae, it was great catching up with you! Remember, stay healthy and active! Good luck with your plans, and I'll talk to you later!
