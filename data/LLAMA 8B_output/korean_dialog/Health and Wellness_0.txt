Here’s the conversation: 

**Doctor (NS)**
Hi again Dr. Lee thanks for coming so quickly today Dr. Lee this is your practice, right.
**Dr Lee (L2, Korean Speaker)**
Many thanks for hurry, yes our practice. Me, Dr.Lee. you want know happen to me?

**Doctor(Native Speaker)
**I will try to speak clearly and do my best listen. What does your body currently feel like – is there are any pain happening anywhere?

(As a consideration for Korean cultures, the way of expression about pain or negative feelings might influence the conversation from Dr. L.)

**Doctor (Native)
**What kinds of symptoms exactly? Head hurts, stomach not feel well somehow, or the body feels the temperature changes are happening?

 Dr. Lee replies with an extremely polite tone so as to adhere to the tradition of Korean communicative style  ( Korean tendency to use words such as sorry or thank).
**Dr lee (L.)**
Ah oh sorry doctor about my body like... um… fever and joint pain. Fever not so… high but little bit, some pain on all body.

 

**Doctor(R)
**Any specific times at which the temperatures are changing is there? It could be before sleep, work, or stress. Also stomach problems are bothering you, would you like drinking something or ate well recently?

(Remember always considerate native speaker will rephrase to clearly help L)
**Dr(Lee) )
Yes, Dr. I’m so sorry still a little feeling stressed about my kid. But then, um, my stomach do feel a itchy sometimes.

**Doctor(E)
**Oh, I remember now. Actually, we got your file this morning. Last time you also had stomach indigestion trouble. Would any foods or materials you consumed the past few meal make you assume something wrong that you might tell me?

Note that in communication with a doc, a l2 speaker does tend to keep asking about explanations, or descriptions. 

.**Dr.
**I a little bit unsure about what this food I see here called wheat. Um…. maybe that. 

**Patient**
Oh oh sorry, here it is food I eat now called wheat germ. But little bit of headache and body start feel a chill, too 
**Doctor(e)
**Have you been more stressed or gotten less sleep and that could mean that your headache and body felt cold could the reason be also your sleep that is less often or less consistently? 

(Please remember patient tends to rely on their traditional culture, use of polite greetings or phrases with an apology also a tendency by the Korean student.)

**Patients(Lee Lee)**
This is a first time for some stress and fever, I had been so grateful to you my doctor for concern and care already.

**Clinic Staff :** (N) Thank so much for our visit today the doctor will analyze the symptoms later. We'd like to hear from you back on Monday.
