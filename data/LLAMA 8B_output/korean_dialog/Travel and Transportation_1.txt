**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Excuse me, I'm a bit lost in this town. Can you help me find the way to the Bella Vista Hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, hotel! Bella Vista, yes, I know. Um... (laughs) Sorry, how to say... I forget...

**Speaker A (NS):** Don't worry, take your time. I'll write down the name again. B-E-L-L-A...?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, sorry! Hotel near... (trying to remember) coffee shop! Café...

**Speaker A (NS):** Café?! You're talking about the Café Central?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! Café Central! Hotel just across... (gestures with hand)

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I think I see. What's the street name?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Street... um... (thinks) mango street! No, not mango... (laughs) I mean...

**Speaker A (NS):** It's okay, take a deep breath. Is it Mango Street that runs parallel to… Main Street?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! Mango Street! That's right!

**Speaker A (NS):** So, if you head back towards the café and turn left onto Main Street, you'll see the hotel on your right?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! I see. Thank you so much! You help me a lot!

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries at all. Have a great day, and enjoy your stay at the hotel!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! Arigatou gozaimasu! (turning to leave)

**Speaker A (NS):)** By the way, your Japanese greeting was perfect! Goodbye, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):)** You're welcome! See you later! Bye!
