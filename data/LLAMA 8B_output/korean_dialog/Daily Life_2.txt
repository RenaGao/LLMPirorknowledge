**Speaker A (NS):** Welcome to your new home! I'm excited to meet you. Thank you for moving in. How are you settling in so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, thank you. I'm... um, how to say... happy. Happy to live here. (laughs)

**Speaker A (NS):** (smiling) Welcome, anyway. What's your name, by the way?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. My name is Eunjoo. Nice to meet you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you too, Eunjoo. So, I was thinking of trying out a new recipe this week. What's your favorite dish to cook?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm, my friend like telling me. (laughs) Okay, so they like Korean dish, bibimbap.

**Speaker A (NS):** Bibimbap is a great choice. I love Korean food. Can you tell me how you prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay. Um, first... we make rice. And then... vegetable, vegetable thing...

**Speaker A (NS):** Vegetable thing? Do you mean bean sprouts or something?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes. Bean sprouts, yes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's it. And then what do you do?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We add beef. Um, beef thing, because I like a little bit spicy.

**Speaker A (NS):** So, you like spicy food?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes. Very much. Like, spicy food make me happy. (laughs)

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm the same way. How about cooking the egg on top?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):**

**Speaker A (NS) making a suggestion) You pour... um, what's the word... liquid... on top of the rice, or you fry the egg?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah-ha! Easier way is... putting, um, egg still (small pause) raw... raw still and then add little bit oil, hot oil on top.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, that's a great idea. And then garnish with some vegetables or kimchi.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes! Kimchi always good. My friend, my friend always say kimchi make it healthy, too.

**Speaker A (NS):** I've heard that too. Well, I'm excited to try making bibimbap together with you. I can explain the recipe in more detail too.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ooh, finally, thank you. I want learn, learn with you. I our friendship get strong.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a lovely way to put it, Eunjoo. We will have fun, I'm sure. Let's have a cooking session soon! Here, let me show you a new kitchen gadget I bought - it's a spiralizer for making noodles.
