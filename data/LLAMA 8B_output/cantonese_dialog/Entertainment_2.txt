**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! Book recommendation? Um, good idea! My friend Kaito like book, but I don't know what.
**Speaker A (NS):** Nice! Let me ask you, what kind of books do you like to read?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, how to say... I like... stories. Stories about... people, uh, solve problem.
**Speaker A (NS):** Stories about people solving problems, got it. Have you heard of the book "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Frank... Frank what? (laughs) Sorry!
**Speaker A (NS):** No worries! It's a great book about a man who goes through the Holocaust and finds meaning in life.
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Wow... um, I see. That very much hard life.
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it's a very challenging life. But the author shows us that even in the darkest times, there's hope for a better future.
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** That's very important message. I will introduce book to Kaito.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great job! I think he'll appreciate it. What do you think about a subtitle or a recommendation on the cover?
