**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, I'm Emily. It's great to meet you. What brings you here tonight?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, hi Emily. I'm Winston. Nice to meet you too. I like the music, why... um, you know, it's very good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, excellent taste in music! I'm glad you enjoy it. Where are you from originally?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** From... um, Hong Kong. I come here four month ago.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, nice! So you're exploring the city. What do you like to do for fun?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like... um, food, especially... Chinese food. And also, uh, go to... park, walk, relax.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like you enjoy the outdoors. I do too. Do you have a favorite dish from back home?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ooh, yes! My mom's... um, cooking. She make... you know, very good dim sum.

**Speaker A (NS):** Dim sum is a staple of Hong Kong cuisine. What about family – do you have any siblings?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, yeah. Um, one... brother. He live in... ask him, I, uh, ask him to help me with... job.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. It's good to have a sibling to rely on. I'm here to support you too, Winston.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you... um, you too, Emily. I... uh, feel happy to know someone new here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Aw, it's my pleasure! It was great talking to you, Winston. Believe me, I think we had a good conversation – starting with the music we both like and talking about our favorite food.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! Agreed! Goodbye, Emily. Take care, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Winston. Take care! Seeing you have a great day everyone!
