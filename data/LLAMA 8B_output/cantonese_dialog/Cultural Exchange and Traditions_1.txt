**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, I'm Alex, nice to meet you. Can you tell me a little about your cultural background and dining habits?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, hello! Yes, I from... um, Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, we eat with chopsticks, but no utensils sometimes too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's fascinating! So, in Hong Kong, you often eat with chopsticks or sometimes not at all?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes. Um, sometimes we eat with spoon too. But, you know, with family, we use chopsticks. 

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What's the significance of using chopsticks in Hong Kong? Is it a comforting or meaningful way to eat?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! Using chopsticks... um, it mean respect to food. We must scoop rice to mouth with chopsticks carefully.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's beautiful! Respect for the food is very important in many cultures, isn't it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! Also, never leave your chopsticks standing up in your food. This bad thing to do. My mom tell me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to know. So, what's an example of an honor that you would give to someone in a meal in Hong Kong?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, great question! We give the elderly guest the best piece of meat, usually on the center plate. This show respect.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's very generous! In many cultures, showing respect to the elderly is deeply ingrained. What's the importance of meals in Hong Kong, especially around special occasions?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah! Holidays, New Year, dinner with family. It's lucky to have food together.

**Speaker A (NS):** And what about these meals â€“ are they typically small or quite abundant?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, plenty of food! Family meals give a lot, so no one attracts going hungry.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great. Now, can you summarize the differences in dining etiquette that we've discussed?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Umm... Tradition in Hong Kong believe, sometimes eat with spoon, but usually eat with chopsticks. Show beware stand chopstick.
