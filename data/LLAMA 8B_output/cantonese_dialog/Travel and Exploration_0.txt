**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Kenta, how are you? I'm Rachel. It's great to meet you.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I happy too, Rachel. Ah, me... me come from... you know, Guangdong. Canton speaking.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, from Guangdong? Nice. I've been there a few times. I'd love to plan a trip with a group of friends. Where would you like to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We can go to Hong Kong? The weather nice... um, warm and humid?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, Hong Kong is a great idea! We can visit Victoria Peak and Temple Street night market. 

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sound nice. But we should also do, um, how to say... played island. You know, with big hotel and beautiful beach.

**Speaker A (Ng):** I think you mean Catamaran Island or Lamma Island?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes. Catamaran Island. I like play with beach, sunbathing and, um, water play.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great plan. What time would you like to start the trip?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Start... um, morning. Perhaps... 7 o'clock? My friend prefer sunrise on island.

**Speaker A (NS):** 7 o'clock is a bit early. How about 9 o'clock? We can have some breakfast first.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, 9 o'clock is good. And also, uh, we should take MTR, right? To get to airport?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not exactly. We can take a bus or taxi to the airport.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bus or taxi, got it. Then, let's go shopping at Causeway Bay!

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like you're really excited! And I think that's a great plan. Let's summarize what we have. We're going to Hong Kong, staying on Catamaran Island, and visiting Causeway Bay.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes. You right. It sound like so much fun! I happy we can go together, Rachel.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too, Kenta! Have a great trip!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):**Thanks, Rachel. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
