**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I'd like to talk to you about a product return policy. Can you tell me what it is?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, return policy! My friend buy thing online, but it no good. They want return. I don't know policy now.

**Speaker A (NS):** For most products, you have 30 days to decide if you want to return or exchange it. Is that correct?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thirty days? Okay, I think. My friend buy thing online three week ago. They want return now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. If you've had the product for more than 30 days, it will be subject to a restocking fee. Do you know how much it is?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese:** Um, 15 percent? No, maybe 20? I no know for sure. Oh, wait, how to say... shop ask you what price.

**Speaker A (NS):** We'll assess the restocking fee based on the item's price. Can I show you the product so we can discuss it further?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, my friend show you. (shows the product) They buy gym shoes. No work wallet.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I see the issue. We can exchange it for store credit or refund. Which do you prefer?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Credit, maybe. My friend no want cashback. They want replace thing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright. We can exchange the shoes for another item of similar value. Before we do this, have you tried to remove the tags and packaging to make it easier?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, good thinking. Yes, my friend take off tag, but still have box. They no know what to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I can help you with that. Just to confirm, you want to exchange the shoes for a refund of the original price minus a restocking fee?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. That's correct. Refund minus fee. I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, I'll help you process the return. And thank you for your understanding!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! Goodbye!  See you, maybe.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Have a good day, Kwen!
