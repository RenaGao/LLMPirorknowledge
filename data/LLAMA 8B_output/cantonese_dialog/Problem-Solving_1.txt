**Speaker A (NS)**: Hi, thank you for reaching out to our customer service. I'm happy to help you with your technical issue. Can you please tell me a little bit about the problem you're experiencing?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Ah, thank you... yes, thank you. My... um, computer, it... not work. When I open, it... stuck. No, no attach. I try restart, but not works.

**Speaker A (NS)**: I understand. So, it gets stuck when you try to open it, and restarting doesn't solve the issue?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yeah... yah, that's right. I feel like it... blocked. You know what I mean?

**Speaker A (NS)**: Yes, that makes sense. Can you tell me what you were doing right before it got stuck?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm... I download... update? Update thing... I think.

**Speaker A (NS)**: You might have downloaded an update before it got stuck. Let me ask you a question: did you receive any error messages or warnings during the update process?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, now you say, yes... yes, I see... um... error message. Mean, system... no attach?

**Speaker A (NS)**: System attach? I'm not quite sure what that means. But we can try to troubleshoot further.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** System attach, I mean system attach... oh, no go nuts. My friend help me explain. 

**Speaker A (NS)**: Don't worry, we'll get it sorted out. Can you try uninstalling the recent software updates and see if that resolves the issue?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Friend of mine do, but I no understand. You say... um... restart... a again? **Wait, no, not try again. Error same happens.**

**Speaker A (NS)**: Let's try resetting your system and see if that resolves the issue.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I try now. *pause* Okay, I restart system... and my computer now work!
