**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, what are your plans for the weekend, Mei?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, thank you for asking. I plan go... um, beach. The weather good lately.

**Speaker A (NS):** The beach sounds great! What do you want to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Swim and sunbathing, I guess. And maybe eat food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun. I was thinking of joining you too. Do you mind if I come along?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Not at all! I welcome you. We can, uh, play games together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! What time were you thinking of going?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ten o’clock sound good? Early or late, you think?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten o’clock is fine. Actually, I think going a little earlier would be better.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Earlier, yes. I see. Okay, then we meet at nine thirty?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! See you then, Mei!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you too! I'm looking forward to it!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We should have a nice weekend.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** By the way... uh, how to say... thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Mei. It was nice chatting with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice talking to you too! Have a great weekend!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! Have a great weekend!

**Turn 20:** I’ll see you at nine thirty tomorrow, then?
