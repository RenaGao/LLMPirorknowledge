**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thanks for chatting with me today, Kenta! Can you tell me about a recent memorable event in your life?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, thank you. I recent go to... um, wedding of my friend. Yes, it is very fun!

**Speaker A (NS):** Congratulations! What made it memorable for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We have... um, traditional dance. In Chinese culture, we call it " Lion Dance". (laughs) I make mistake in dance, but everyone help me and we all laugh.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! It's great when we can laugh together with friends and family. How did that experience make you feel?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I feel... (thinks) how you say "heartwarming"? It is like my heart feel warm inside.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a beautiful way to express it! A heartwarming experience indeed. Did it change your perspective on anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** (pauses) Yes, after this... um, wedding party, I think I realize how important honesty is in relationship.

**Speaker A (NS):** Honesty is always a valuable lesson. Did you talk to your friend or family about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, I talk to my mom. She say, "Kenta, honesty is like... um, this (holds up finger) straight line."

**Speaker A (NS):** Love that analogy! Straight line, clear and honest.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Exactly! (smiling) My mom very wise.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great, Kenta. It sounds like your friend's wedding had a lasting impact on you. Well, thank you for sharing that story with me.
