**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, welcome to our home! I'm really excited to have you as a new roommate. Can you tell me about your favorite meal and how you prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! Um, my favorite meal... (pauses)...it's vegetable stir-fry! My mom teach me how to make it.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great. What ingredients do you use?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, vegetables... many vegetables. And rice, of course. (pauses) How to say... you know, mix vegetable with soy sauce?

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean marinate the vegetables? That makes a big difference in the flavor.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! Exactly! And more time for frying, um, stir-frying with garlic, ginger... good flavor! (smiling)

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious. Do you have a special wok or pan for cooking it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! Steel wok, my mom have it. It's, um, heat up very quickly.

**Speaker A (NS):** Steel woks are fantastic for stir-frying. Can you tell me about any tips or tricks you use when cooking this dish?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay. (pauses) Um, don't overcook the vegetables. And add seasonings last, so... flavor come out more.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great tip. I'm sure it must be very convenient having your mom's guidance in the kitchen.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! Very convenient. And my mom, she teach me... you know, traditional cooking way.
