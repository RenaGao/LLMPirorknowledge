**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kenta! Thank you for meeting with me today. We can discuss your fitness goals and create a routine that suits you.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, thank you sir! Kenta nice to meet. Um, my goal is, how to say... to lose weight.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great goal! What makes you want to lose weight?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, excuse me, how to say... because I no more fat suit, very uncomfortable.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What exercises do you enjoy or have experience with?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I like... um, jogging, yes jogging good exercise for body, ah.

**Speaker A (NS):** Jogging is a great way to get started. How often do you think you can commit to jogging per week?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Three times a week, definitely! But, um, how to say... I have busy schedule, have to check calendar.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, we can adjust the schedule as needed. Have you considered strengthening exercises like weightlifting or Pilates?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! Weightlifting good for build... um, muscles, yes!

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We can incorporate weightlifting or Pilates into your routine to help with muscle tone.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** That would be great! But, um, I have knee problem, doctor say I no do much hop... um, exercise on it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. We can definitely take that into consideration when designing your routine. We might focus on low-impact exercises like cycling or swimming.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, swimming good exercise! But how to say... I no know how to swim.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, we can still find alternative exercises that work for you.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, thank you, sir! You help me a lot!

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Let's summarize our plan: we'll aim to jog three times a week, incorporate weightlifting or Pilates, and avoid high-impact exercises due to your knee issue. Sound good to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! Very good! Should I... um, write it down?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not necessary, we can review the plan together during our next session. Until then, I'll email you a sample workout routine for you to try.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, thank you, sir! Goodbye for now!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Kenta! Have a great day and happy training!
