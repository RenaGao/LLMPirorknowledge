**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, I'm Mei, and it's great to meet you, Wing. Can you tell me a bit about what's on your mind for the meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, thank you, Mei! I, um, "how say"... We need plan team meeting, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Planning a team meeting, right. What kind of issues did you want to discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Me, Wing, have some problem to... uh, solve. Maybe share with others, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a good idea. What kind of problems do you have?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** My... my manager about performance review. I, um, "not clear"... how to prepare.

**Speaker A (NS):** Performance review can be a bit tricky. Let me help. What do you want to review, specifically?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I want... um, "evaluation"... on my tasks. Make sure they... uh, "right" yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Checking on your task's assessment. We can add that to the agenda. Any other issues?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** My team, we want... um, discuss on project timeline. Better together, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Collaboration on the project timeline. Sounds like a good plan. Now, let's create a simple agenda. For next week's meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Simple agenda, yes! We do performance review, project timeline, and maybe... uh, "easy"... to-do list.

**Speaker A (NS):** Brilliant! Easy tasks are always a benefit. Alright, I think that's a good start! Shall we wrap up here and confirm our agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Duke yes, duke! Agenda, performance review, timeline, and to-do list! Yes!

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed! For next time, Wing, I'll send you a summary. And don't forget to finalize your review materials, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you, Mei! I making summary, and review material, yes!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome. It was great collaborating with you, Wing! Have a great day, and see you next time!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you, Mei! Have nice day, too!
