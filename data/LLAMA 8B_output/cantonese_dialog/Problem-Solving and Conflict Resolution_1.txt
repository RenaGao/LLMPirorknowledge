**Turn 2**
**Speaker A (NS):** Sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's not working correctly? For example, is your internet connection dropping, or is it showing an error message?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, um, error message. It say, uh, "connection fail."

**Turn 3**
**Speaker A (NS):** Connection fail, that means there's an issue with our servers. Have you tried restarting your router or modem to see if it resolves the issue?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, um, restart. I try last time, no work. Maybe my router... stupid?

**Turn 4**
**Speaker A (NS):** Don't worry, it's not your fault. Sometimes routers can be faulty. Have you checked to see if there are any physical obstructions or hardware issues that might be affecting the connection?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, no... I think no. My router, uh, how to say... near the wall?

**Turn 5**
**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Is there a possibility that the issue is on our end? We can try to run some diagnostics on our end to see if there's a problem with the connection.
