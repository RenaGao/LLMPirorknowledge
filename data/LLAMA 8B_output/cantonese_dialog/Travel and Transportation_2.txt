**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, welcome to our travel planning session. Can you introduce yourself and what kind of trip you're thinking of?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, hello! My name is Wing, nice to meet you. We, um, think about trip for, ah, how many days?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, that's a good question. Typically, we can plan for anything from a long weekend to two weeks. How about we focus on a seven-day trip? That gives us enough time to explore a place.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, okay, seven day good. So, um, destination, ah... We, me and friends, want go to... where good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! For a group vacation, I recommend somewhere with lots of activities. Have you guys thought about any particular places?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hm, maybe, um... beach? My friends like swim, I like swim too!

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, that's a fantastic idea! A beach trip sounds like fun. What type of beach activities were you thinking of?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, swimming, playing games... you know, sun, sand...

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We can do a lot of fun stuff. Now, let's talk about where we should go. Some popular beach destinations are Bali, Thailand, and Vietnam. Do any of these stand out to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hm... um, I like Thai food. How to say... good food...

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) Well, Thailand has delicious food, but also amazing beaches! Let me show you some options.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, nice! You have... um... picture?

**Speaker A (NS):** Here's a slideshow of popular beach destinations. We can talk more about these.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, oh, wow... look at these... nice pictures...

**Speaker A (NS):** Which one do you think you might like? You can see pictures of Phuket, Krabi, or Koh Samui.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, how to say... um, nice water...

**Speaker A (NS):** That's the Krabi region. It has stunning beaches. How about we book a tour for Krabi?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes, good! Thank you. Now, when go?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about in three months? That gives us time to finalize plans and prepare.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Three months? Good. Yes, okay! Um, you can help with flight and, ah, booking, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I'll take care of it. You guys can just pack and get excited for your trip!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yay, thank you so much! Ah, we'll, um, have to decide about, uh, what day leave, yeah?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. I'll send you an itinerary and all the details in the next week.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you so much! It's been fun chatting with you! See you soon!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then, Wing! Enjoy your vacation!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Enjoy, thank you!
