**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kanta. I see you're looking confused about your homework assignment. Can I help you clarify anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, thank you. I from Hong Kong. I study in university. But, um, I confused about assignment. You call it... "Economics of Environment"?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's Economics for the Environment. What specifically is confusing you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I read chapter two. But, um, I not understand " externality." Can you explain how to find price on externality?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's break it down. An externality is when an economic activity affects the environment in a way that isn't accounted for in the market price. For example, pollution from factories. The market price doesn't include the damages caused by pollution. That's an externality. Think of it as an additional cost.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I see! So, it's like when government make rule for no more trash from factories, that is like... externality problem?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! The government is essentially internalizing the externality by setting regulations that include the costs of pollution in the market price. Do you think that makes sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yeah, I think so. But how to find price in externality? Is it like, um, math problem?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it involves calculations. However, the specific method may vary depending on the context. Let's simplify it and talk about how to approach finding the price in an externality scenario.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I understand better now. Thank you, sir!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Kanta. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. By the way, have you been able to complete the torn mantles calculation?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, no, I still... um, have problem. But let me try, and then I can ask later.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! It was nice helping you understand the economics of externality. See you in our next class!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, see you later!
