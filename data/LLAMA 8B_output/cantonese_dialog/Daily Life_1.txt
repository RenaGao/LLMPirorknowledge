**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Kenta! Nice to meet you. I'm here to talk about planning a weekend picnic with my family. What do you think about having a picnic?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. Picnic good. We go park? Book table? Sun good.
**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, let's book a table first. Where were you thinking of having the picnic?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, my friend tell me... Marsh park. Good spot for picnic. Many trees, comfort.
**Speaker A (NS):** Marsh park sounds nice. What kind of food would you suggest we bring?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Food... um, I think... sandwiches, fruit... some cake!
**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a great idea. We should also bring some drinks. I was thinking of packing a basket with some snacks. Do you have any ideas for that?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! Um, my mom make something special for picnic. Veggie... thing... with cheese!
**Speaker A (NS):** Hmm, that sounds delicious. How do you think we should set up the picnic area?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah! Flags, blanket, and... um, all things... matching!
**Speaker A (NS):** Great ideas, Kenta! What about entertainment for the kids? We should bring some games, right?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes! Frisbee, ball, and... um, I think... bubbles!
**Speaker A (NS):** That's perfect! I'll make sure to pack some bubbles. So, shall we set up the picnic for 10 a.m. on Saturday?
