**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** That's just around the corner! We'll make sure to plan a small celebration.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese, Eva):** Ah, you have party idea too. Good.

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** Actually, yes! Eva was saying you might have some music to share? Materials for the party?

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** Oh, cool! We can add that to the playlist. Can you also show me that song your mom says is special?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese, Eva):** Tell grandma you like song last month... how to say... nice vocal. Your grandma love it.

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** Okay, thanks for reminding me! We're excited for your visit! Take care of yourself while you're here.
