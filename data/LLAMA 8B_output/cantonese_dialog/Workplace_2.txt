**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Kaito, I'm glad we could schedule this meet-and-greet! I'll be explaining a project I'm working on.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, hi, hello. Um, project. I want to know more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Our team's working on implementing a new project management tool to improve processes and operations. One of our major objectives is to streamline communication among team members.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Streamline. That is, help to... um, make things easier?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. It'll help us share information more efficiently. This requires... *reads from notes* ...writing daily updates in a shared document and estimating the time-consuming activities to prioritize our schedule.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Estimated. Um, that is, predicting the time it will take to do something.

**Speaker A (NS):**Yes, and that will help us avoid setting unrealistic deadlines.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I see. Deadlines, that is, timelines. Also, can use this, um, calendar...

**Speaker A (NS):** A calendar for reference. That's exactly what we did!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** So, what do I need to do first?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! I want you to coordinate with John in marketing and Fi in HR to make sure we're all on the same page regarding this project's launch event.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Coordinate. Do, um, plan with John and... har?

**Speaker A (NS):** Hex. Yes, that's right! Discuss the event details with him.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Alright, I got it. Just... um, make sure we have information communicated thoroughly.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Open communication is key to a successful project rollout.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Open... how to say... um, free and honest communication?

**Speaker A (NS):** The right way to put it, Kaito!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Great, I'm... um, thanks for explaining. I think I understand what I need to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Kaito! It was a pleasure to brief you on the project. We'll talk later today to review your progress.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Good, good. Okay, if you said so. Thank you, goodbye.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Kaito! Thanks for listening. Safe goodbye!
