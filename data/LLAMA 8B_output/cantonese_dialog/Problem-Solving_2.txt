**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Wing, I made a mistake regarding our weekend plan. I forgot I have another commitment on Saturday, and I won't be able to go to the beach.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, okay, okay!.Me, um, cannot make too, yeah? But I already pay for... um, umbrella, okay? And sand... thing... wah, how do you say... beach blanket?

**Speaker A (NS):** Don't worry about the umbrella; maybe you can find someone else to share it with. I was thinking we could plan an alternative day. How about we reschedule for Sunday instead?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sunday ah? But... um, weather better on weekend, no? Maybe we go... um, every day, haha! Or how to say... another place?

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) Ah, that's a good idea! There are plenty of other places we can go. Actually, I was thinking we could go to the park instead. They have a great playground for exercising and a nice caf√© for a picnic.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes! Park sound nice! But how do you call... um, road for bike, ve-... engine-thing? Yeah, with engine!

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean like a bicycle? We can ride our bikes there and enjoy the scenery.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bicycle! Right! Me like bicycles! Can we... um, take picture together with bike?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! We can take plenty of pictures. I'll bring my camera to capture the memories.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Nice! Thank you, friend. I promise... um, go next Sunday, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, it's settled then. I'm looking forward to Sunday's adventure.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sunday ah... sound nice. Ta-ra, friend!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you Sunday!
