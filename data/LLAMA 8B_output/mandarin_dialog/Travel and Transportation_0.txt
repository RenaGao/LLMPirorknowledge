**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS)**: Hey, Kaito! How's it going? What have you been up to lately?

**Speaker B (Mandarin speaker)**: Ah, good. *um* I come back from Hong Kong last week. Very nice.

**Speaker A**: Oh, cool! What made you choose Hong Kong?

**Speaker B**: Food, yes! Hong Kong have much good food. And *ah* city very lively.

**Speaker A**: That’s true! The food in Hong Kong is amazing. What was your favorite dish there?

**Speaker B**: Um... cha siu bao, yes! You know, the pork bun? Mmm...

**Speaker A**: Ha! Yes, I love those too. Did you try any other cuisines?

**Speaker B**: Yes! I try... um, dim sum. *pauses* And Fungi meal, yes! Mushroom!

**Speaker A**: Fungus or fungus? Whatever you said, I'm curious!

**Speaker B**: *laughs* Um, fungus! *laughs* Mushroom dish, yes!

**Speaker A**: Oh, okay! So, what about the city itself? Did you get a chance to explore?

**Speaker B**: Ah, yes! I go to Victoria Peak. And also visit... um, *undecipherable phrase* Inner Harbour?

**Speaker A**: You mean the Victoria Harbour? Yeah, it’s breathtaking!

**Speaker B**: Yes, yes! Nice view! Many big building too.

**Speaker A**: That’s one of the things I love about Hong Kong – the contrast between old and new.

**Speaker B**: Yes! Many old dushi, yes! And now modern.

**Speaker A**: Traditional and modern combine together. That’s great.

**Speaker B**: True! *pauses* So, Kaito, what about visa? You want... um, help for friends?

**Speaker A**: Actually, I’m doing pretty well. I just need to renew my passport.

**Speaker B**: Passport, ah! *smiling* Okay, okay! Sometime help soon.

**Speaker A**: Don’t worry, I’ll let you know if I need any assistance.

**Speaker B**: Great, thank you. Today very nice talk.

**Speaker A**: Likewise, Kaito! Maybe we can catch up soon in person?

**Speaker B**: *surprised* Ah, yes! Nice to see.

**Speaker A**: Alright, farewell then!

**Speaker B**: *same expression* Before this, we agree.
