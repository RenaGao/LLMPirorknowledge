**Speaker B:**

**Speaker A:**

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes! A river. It is very... um, good for photo. You know, for picture.

**Speaker A:**
Beautiful view for sure! Alright, let's head to the garden. I have a small map here, but it seems the entrance is on the other side of the street.

**Speaker B:** (pauses) How to walk there? We take... um, road... the big road?

**Speaker A:**

**Speaker B:** Okay! Me remember. We turn left at... uh, outside store. There is... food store.

**Speaker A:**
Food store? Great, we can stop there for water. Yes, turn left just outside the store and go straight on.

**Speaker B:** Good! I think... um, turn left then right turn. We be... there?

**Speaker A:**
You'll know when we get close to the garden. There's usually a big sign outside. (smiling) Are you excited?

**Speaker B:** ((smiling) Yes! Little bit! Me see many plants.

(They walk awhile in silence, then continue the conversation.)

**Speaker A:**
We're getting close. Now, let's turn right onto the sidewalk.

**Speaker B:** (looking around) Ah! There... um, the sign! "Botanical Garden".

**Speaker A:** Great, look! And there's the entrance. Welcome to the garden!
