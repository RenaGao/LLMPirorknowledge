**Speaker B (L2 Speaker)**: Oh, hello! *ahem!* Sorry, how to say... I'm so happy to here today.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's great to have you here! Can you tell me a little bit about your traditional holiday that you'd like to share with others?

**Speaker B**: Yes, ah-hmm... *pauses* Um, Chinese New Year is big festival in my country.

**Speaker A:** Fascinating! I'd love to learn more about it. What's the main activities or traditions during Chinese New Year?

**Speaker B**: Ah, yes... there are lots of food, family to gather together... *uses hand gesture* like this. We eat dumplings, sweet rice, and red color symbol... um, good luck?

**Speaker A:** That sounds vibrant and delicious! What about decorations? Are there any specific items that people use to decorate during the holiday?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes! *excitedly* My mother make very beautiful *ahem* lantern. Very colorful. And we also hang up red paper cut, you know, to... um, ward off bad spirit?

**Speaker A:** I see. Red is such an important color in Chinese culture, isn't it? And the lanterns sound beautiful. Have you ever helped make them?

**Speaker B**: Oooh, yes! When I small, my teacher in school teach me how to make them. So fun!

**Speaker A:** That's adorable! I'm sure it's a unique craft. Now, if you were planning a cultural event to share your traditions with others, what kind of activities would you include?

**Speaker B**: Ah-hmm... possibly, um, cooking class? Make dumplings, fried rice, um, common Chinese food.

**Speaker A:** Mmm, that sounds wonderful! A cooking session would be a great way to share your culture. What about traditional performance like music, dance, or martial arts?

**Speaker B**: Ah, yes! Chinese traditional music and Chinese lion dance, very beautiful and powerful.

**Speaker A:** That would be amazing! Maybe invite some Chinese-instrument players and lion dance team. And then, where would you hold the event?

**Speaker B**: *excitedly* Community center, yes! Or, um, park, have space for... *agrees by nodding*

**Speaker A:** Great ideas! And lastly, what would you say to your guests at the end of the event to thank them for joining?

**Speaker B**: Ah, yes... thank you for come! Enjoy the traditional... Chinese culture *enunciates more clearly*, my name is Li Yi, Li Yee.

**Speaker A:** *smiles* Thank you, Li, it was a pleasure talking with you. Our best cultural exchange idea seems to be a delicious and vibrant celebration of Chinese New Year! We will meet again soon, right? *hugs* Ah-ha! *winking* Goodbye!
