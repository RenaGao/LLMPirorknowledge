**Speaker A:** Hi, I'm Alex. I'm glad you could join me today. Can you tell me a little about yourself?
**Speaker B:** Ah, thank you, Alex. My name is Kenta. I'm from... um, Japan. I study in university in Shanghai.

**Turn 2:**
**Speaker A:** That's fascinating. What do you study?
**Speaker B:** I study business. I very interested in China culture.

**Turn 3:**
**Speaker A:** That's great. I'd love to hear more about it. What are some differences in dining etiquette between China and the US?
**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. In China, we very formal. You must use both hands when receiving food, or when giving food to others.

**Turn 4:**
**Speaker A:** That's so interesting. What about in the US?
**Speaker B:** In US, people very... um, how to say... casual. They just grab the food with their hands.

**Turn 5:**
**Speaker A:** (laughs) That's a big difference! What about at the table? Do you sit in a certain way?
**Speaker B:** Yes, we sit with both feet on the floor, never cross them.

**Turn 6:**
**Speaker A:** That's neat. And what about tipping?
**Speaker B:** Ah, no tipping! In China, we just... um, show respect with how we behave.

**Turn 7:**
**Speaker A:** That makes sense. So, if you're dining with someone in the US, would you be uncomfortable with the custom of tipping?
**Speaker B:** Yes, very uncomfortable. But I try to learn and adapt.

**Turn 8:**
**Speaker A:** That's very understanding of you. What do you think is the most interesting thing about dining in China?
**Speaker B:** Ah, it's the tradition of eating family-style. You share many dishes together.

**Turn 9:**
**Speaker A:** That sounds wonderful. And how do you find the food?
**Speaker B:** Food is very delicious. But sometimes very spicy.

**Turn 10:**
**Speaker A:** (laughs) That can be a challenge. What's one thing you've learned about American dining etiquette?
**Speaker B:** Ah, I learn to use napkin. In China, we not use napkin.

**Turn 11:**
