**Speaker A (Native Speaker):** Hi there! I haven't seen you around here before. What brings you to this party?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Ah, hello... um, I from... uh, what is this word? Ah yes, Beijing! I am international student, so I visit many countries.

**Speaker A:** Nice to meet you! What do you study in college?

**Speaker B:** I study English language... um, teach foreign language, yes. My university, um, up this way, sometimes I give... how to say, English class.

**Speaker A:** That's great! I'm studying engineering. We don't have that many language classes in our program.

**Speaker B:** That's okay! I think it's good to be... um, creative, yes? Speak many languages.

**Speaker A:** Exactly! So, what do you like to do for fun?

**Speaker B:** I like play... uh, soccer! And also, um, watch movies, yes. Chinese movies.

**Speaker A:** Cool! I've never tried watching a Chinese movie, but I'll give it a shot.

**Speaker B:** Ah, nice to learn from me! We should... yes, maybe, have a movie night?

**Speaker A:** Sounds like a plan! But for now, I should probably mingle some more. Nice meeting you!

**Speaker B:** Similarly! Good luck finding others to talk to. (smiling and walking away)

**Speaker B:** (Stopping and turning back) You know, um, maybe I give you my card. We can exchange email for, uh, movie night.

**Speaker A:** Ah, great idea! I'd love to stay in touch. Thanks again for talking to me!

**Speaker B:** Anytime! (Shaking hands and smiling)

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Maybe I'll see you around this campus?

**Speaker B:** Bai bi√©![1] Goodbye to you, too. Have a good night!
