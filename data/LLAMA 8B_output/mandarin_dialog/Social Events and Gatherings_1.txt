**Native Speaker (NS)**: Hey, Liang! So, you want to plan a surprise party for your friend's birthday? What's the plan so far?
**Second-Language Speaker (Mandarin)**: Haha! Yeah, surprise party! I think we need... um, invitation... thing. You know, like card or something.
**NS**: Ah, great idea! And how many people do you want to invite?
**Liang (Mandarin)**: Hmmm... a few friends, maybe family too. Like grandmother, she love friends very much.
**NS**: That's lovely! Grandmothers are always the best. What's the theme for the party?
**Liang**: Um, how to say... beach party! Yes, beach party! We have hot summer now, right?
**NS**: Ha! That's a great idea! We can decorate the place with flowers and make it feel like a beach. What about the cake? Do you have a design in mind?
**Liang**: Cake! Yes, cake! We need... um, big cake with many fireworks... oh, I mean, candles! Candles on top.
**NS**: (laughs) Brick and mortar combination! I love it! We can also have some fun games and activities.
**Liang**: Game! Yes, games! We can play ring toss or... uh, how you say... test of balance?
**NS**: (laughs) You mean rocker or balance beam?
**Liang**: Ah, yes! Balance beam! And we need... um, music thing... DJ, maybe?
**NS**: Awesome! We can definitely arrange for music and games. What about the actual party location?
**Liang**: My classroom! Not so big, but we have good acoustics... I think.
**NS**: (laughs) That's a bit of a deviation from the beach party, but we can work with that. Last thing: what's the surprise plan for your friend?
**Liang**: (smiling) Um, how to tell... (laughs) No! You know, just surprise! But we need to practice... um, fun practice music before getting there.
**NS**: (smiling) Got it! Well, I think we have a solid plan. When do you want to finalize everything?
**Liang**: Let me check... weekend maybe? Yeah, week-end. Nice and quiet. (turns to native speaker) Right?
**NS**: (smiling) Sounds like a plan to me! Thanks for your help, Liang.
**Liang**: Thanks, NS! (in farewell tone) Xiao xie xie! Have a good day!
**NS**: You too! (gives a hello in Mandarin) Hǎo shǔ hǎo míng xīn!
**Liang**: (smiling) Hehe, get it! Don't tell the others...
