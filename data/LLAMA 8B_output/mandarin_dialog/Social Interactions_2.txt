**Speaker B (L2 Speaker, Mandarin)**: Ni hao, Mike! Ah, I am good. I am busy with work, but I not feel very tired.

**Speaker A (NS)**: That's great! I'm glad to hear that. I've been thinking about visiting you and the family soon. How's my cousin, Emily?

**Speaker B (L2)**: Emily? Ah, she is... um, okay. She go to school now. And Mom, she is... happy, yes?

**Speaker A (NS)**: That's wonderful! I'm sure she's doing great. I heard a new restaurant opened in town. Have you tried it yet?

**Speaker B (L2)**: Restaurant? Ah, yes! I go there with my friend last week. Um, they have... nice sushi.

**Speaker A (NS)**: Sushi, great choice! I love sushi. Maybe we can try it together next time I'm in town.

**Speaker B (L2)**: Maybe yes! That will be... very nice. Maybe next week?
