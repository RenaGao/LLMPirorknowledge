**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, Alex):** Oh, thank you. I think we should talk about project status. Um, how to say... recently we have many task, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Task. I see. What specific projects do you think we should focus on?

**Speaker B (Alex):** Ah, good question. Um... Project 1 and Project 2, they very important. And also, we need to discuss deadline... you know, for finish project.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. I'd like to add one more thing â€“ the meeting goals. Should we prioritize customer feedback or goals for Q2?

**Speaker B (Alex):** Hmmm, I think... good question. Yes, customer feedback yes, very important. Make sure our product good for customer.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great point. How about we allocate 10 minutes for customers feedback, then 10 minutes for Q2 goals?

**Speaker B (Alex):** Yes, good plan! Ten minutes each. And also, um... what the next topic after that?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about discussing project timelines and resource allocation?

**Speaker B (Alex):** Um... after lunch, maybe 2 o'clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** That works for me. How about we finalize the agenda for 10 items, with time allocated for each?

**Speaker B (Alex):** 10 item. Yes, good plan. Sorry, one more thing. What about end, um... how to say... meeting minutes?
