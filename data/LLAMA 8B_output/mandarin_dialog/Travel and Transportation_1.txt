**Speaker A (Native Speaker)**: Hi there! Can I ask for directions to the nearby hotel?
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker)**: Ah, hello! Hotel... um, you mean hotel for... sleep?
**Speaker A (Native Speaker)**: Yes, exactly! I'm looking for a hotel to rest for the night. Do you know where it is?
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker)**: Hotel... I think I know. Um... it near market.
**Speaker A (Native Speaker)**: That sounds familiar. Is it on the main road or a side street?
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker)**: I think it on... um, how to say... side... (sound effect) * rude Ãªr * side street.
**Speaker A (Native Speaker)**: Okay, side street. How long will it take to walk there from here?
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker)**: Um, 10... (pause) I think it 10 minutes? Maybe?
**Speaker A (Native Speaker)**: That sounds reasonable. Can you point me in the right direction?
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker)**: Yes! (pointing) Um, you see that building? (points) You go... um, right side and turn left... (gestures)
**Speaker A (Native Speaker)**: Got it! Thank you so much for helping me out. I really appreciate it!

**Speaker A (Native Speaker)**: Thank you! You too! Bye!
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker)**: Bye! 
(As the Native Speaker leaves, the Second-Language Speaker mutters to themselves in Mandarin, then responds in English)
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker)**: Lonely road ahead. I must try learn more English phrases...
**Speaker A (Native Speaker)**: Excuse me, did you just say something?
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker)**: Oh, no, I no say anything. Um, just... uh, just think to myself!
