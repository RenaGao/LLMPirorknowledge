Here is a conversation between the Native Speaker (NS) and the Second-Language Speaker (L2):

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Ling, thanks for coming over. What's wrong? You seem upset.

**Speaker B (L2, Ling):** Ah, thank you. I... I confuse. My friend, she say I borrow her phone, but now she say no. I don't understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Let's talk about it. Can you tell me what happened again?

**Speaker B (L2, Ling):** Um, yes. I borrow her phone two day ago. And now she say I must... um, give it back immediately.

**Speaker A (NS):** And what did you think when your friend asked you to borrow her phone?

**Speaker B (L2, Ling):** I think... I no think I take it for long time. Just need one time for call my family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. It sounds like your friend might be thinking you borrowed it for longer.

**Speaker B (L2, Ling):** Yes. She worry I lose it. But I no lose it. My phone... um, in my bag now.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like there's a misunderstanding. Why don't we try to call your friend and clear things up?

**Speaker B (L2, Ling):** Okay. I try call her now. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, that's a good idea.

**Speaker B (L2, Ling):** *calls friend* Ah, okay. Speak with her.

**Speaker A (NS):** *waits as Ling is on the phone*

**Speaker B (L2, Ling):** Okay. Thank you. We resolve now.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great to hear! *smiles*

**Speaker B (L2, Ling):** Yes, good. Now I know... um, what happen.

**Speaker A (NS):** *smiles* Well, let's hope you and your friend can get back to normal now. By the way, do you want me to come over sometime this week?

**Speaker B (L2, Ling):** Ah, yes. Maybe Wednesday is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. I'll come over around 2 pm.

**Speaker B (L2, Ling):** Thank you. Bye.

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Ling. Have a great day!
