**Native Speaker (NS) A**: So, we want to stay healthy and active today. How does one go about that, Kevin?

**Speaker B (2nd-Language)**: Um... healthy, means no get... uh, not get sick! Yes? Make sure you food, water go... in correct body function...

**NS**: Absolutely. Exercise is key to staying active and healthy, no?

**SB**: Ah! Exercise. Is that mean? Like running fast, very easy, and just walk...

**NS**: Ah, Kevin. That's absolutely right. Being active is like going for walks, cycling... even swimming?

**SB**: Swimming. Not very common Chinese sport, how to say "but"? Because, no rivers nearby my area.

**NS**: Ah! Well, living in cities near water is fortunate, then you can explore cycling or boating!

**SB**: Cycling? Use two... ah, use not use my knee...

**NS**: Do mean, knee and... bike no go?

**SB**: "Yes". Cycle and my other knee don’t get hurt in case!

**NS**: Fair enough, balancing the weight correctly while biking's crucial! Walking's easy? Would that... also...

**SB**: Actually, um easy... good if have time more walk!

**NS**: Very good idea Kevin. When did you get injured? Did bike make that fall?

**SB**: One bad day last. No not blame... ah own... me fault! Wrong steps while climbing steep path up too quickly... ah

**NS**: Alright that was the good day but do try taking up that same speed walking when there's the big incline okay?

**Speaker B**: Haha okay agreed... Kevin so many great and simple things say... my many... not fully clear what your advice said earlier so my good question I forget. To tell the other. So thanks also... (and good time in our conversations then, thank Kev! Enjoy weekend you okay?) 

They are meeting sometime later next meeting at new Café so here say thanks also we both very see again!

Please let me put my coat (I don not need...), take photos quickly so let give good send on! Bye!
They agree have next meetup another weekend.
"I have been, very thankful talking to K with the easy things like biking all week for how it feel."
Bye.
