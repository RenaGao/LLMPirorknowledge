**Native Speaker (NS), Fitness Trainer:**
Thanks for coming in today! Can you tell me a bit about your fitness goals?

**Second-Language Speaker (Mandarin), Client:**
Ah, hello! My name is Jian. I am from... uh, Shanghai. I want to... um, how to say... healthy body.

**NS:** Great! Aim for a healthy body, exactly. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?

**Mandarin Speaker:** Oh, yes! I run every... um, Sunday. I also do... exercise... for arms, um, push-ups. And also, I want to... stomach, how to say?

**NS:** Core workout? You want to strengthen your core.

**Mandarin Speaker:** Yes, yes! Core workout. And I want to... weigh less. Um, fewer kilos.

**NS:** Okay, making a weight loss goal can be achieved with a good plan. Do you have any specific exercises you dislike or find difficult?

**Mandarin Speaker:** Ah... ummm... yoga. I not like. Too... um, (laughs), too bendy.

**NS:** (laughs) That’s understandable. We can definitely find you some alternatives to yoga. Do you have a preferred time of day for exercise?

**Mandarin Speaker:** I like morning. But also, I sometimes exercise... um, evening, after work.

**NS:** That’s great flexibility. We can discuss more on scheduling during our sessions. Do you have any questions about your training before we begin?

**Mandarin Speaker:** Ah, one question! How many time... um, (laughs), how many times I do exercise each week?

**NS:** Good question, Jian. I recommend 3-4 times a week, depending on your progress and goals.

**Mandarin Speaker:** Okay, thank you. That sounds... um, reasonable.

**NS:** Alright, let’s summarize our discussion. You aim for a healthy body, with goals to strengthen your core and lose weight. We’ll schedule your training to include morning and evening sessions.

**Mandarin Speaker:** Correct! Then I do this for... um, how to say... half a year?

**NS:** Sounds like a plan! I look forward to helping you achieve your fitness goals. By the way, thanks for your effort to speak English with me. Maybe you can tell me your Chinese name next time?

**Mandarin Speaker:** (smiles) Yes, thanks for help! You make me more confident about English! My name is Jian Zhen, in English it mean "firm and steady."

**NS:** Nice! I like that meaning. Well, I'm Jian Zhen now too! Let's meet again next week!
