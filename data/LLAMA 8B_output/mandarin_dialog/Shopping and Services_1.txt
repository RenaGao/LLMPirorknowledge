**Speaker A**:
The window size? What do you mean?

**Speaker B**:
I mean, before buying TV, I want to know, err, * window size, screen size*... with glass? Or maybe no glass? And uh, TV style, *flat or not flat*

**Speaker A**:
Okay, so you're thinking about the screen size and the design. That's a good point. What else do you consider?

**Speaker B**:
Price, yes! And also *sound system*... like, sound good or no sound good? And *internet connection*, can watch online or no?

**Speaker A**:
Great points! So you're thinking about the price, sound quality, and internet connectivity.

**Speaker B**:
And *warranty*, warranty period *how many years*? If break, they repair or replace, right?

That's a very good question! A warranty is an essential factor to consider when buying a TV.

Absolutely! A good brand reputation can mean a lot to the quality and durability of the product.

**Speaker B**:
Yes! *Safety feature*, like, *parent lock* or *show only for my family*... so kids not *watch what not*?
