Here's a conversation between a native English speaker (NS) and a Mandarin speaker (Second-Language Speaker, B), focusing on plan steps to address a shared problem with a coworker.

**Turn 1**
NS: Hi Ming, thanks for coming to our meeting today. I hear there's an issue with the new marketing project.
**Turn 2**
B: Thanks, Sarah. I'm glad we talk about this. Problem is, project deadline very tight, but team no have enough budget.
**Turn 3**
NS: That's challenging. What do you think we can do to address this?
**Turn 4**
B: Um, maybe we can... um, discuss deadline? Try to make new one that give us more time.
**Turn 5**
NS: Let's look at the project timeline. What are the critical milestones we need to meet?
**Turn 6**
B: Ah, yeah! Milestone one, two, three... we need to... um, make website. But for now, we have no theme for website. Very difficult.
**Turn 7**
NS: I see. Can you walk me through your ideas for the website theme?
**Turn 8**
B: Well, I think... um... we should make website about... about intro ad for main products. Yes!
**Turn 9**
NS: That's a great idea! How do you think we can support that with our resources?
**Turn 10**
B: Um... I think... um, maybe make one phone call to... uh, construction manager? Person who have website skills.
**Turn 11**
NS: Sounds like a plan! I'll reach out to them and see what they recommend.
**Turn 12**
B: Yes, and then... um, discuss with design team. What do they think we can do to make website better?
**Turn 13**
NS: Absolutely. I'll schedule a meeting with them for this week.
**Turn 14**
B: Okay. Then we can... um, try to make prototype?
**Turn 15**
NS: Exactly! We'll create a prototype based on the concepts we've discussed.
**Turn 16**
B: Okay, then... um, deadline move? We have more time to finish project.
**Turn 17**
NS: Yes, we can adjust the deadline. I'll send out a revised timeline to the team.
**Turn 18**
B: Thank you, Sarah, for help me come up with plan. Your ideas are very helpful.
**Turn 19**
NS: It was a team effort, Ming. I'm glad we could work through this together.
**Turn 20**
B: Sounds good, I agree. Until next time, thank you very much.

At this point, the conversation is concluded with both speakers acknowledging the newly developed plan to address their shared problem and parting ways with polite expressions.
