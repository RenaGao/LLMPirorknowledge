**Speaker A (Native Speaker, Jessica):** Hi, Yuliang! What's a special celebration you'd like to talk about from your culture?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Yuliang):** Ah, thank... um... Qī Shì Fēng Huātiān ((identifies a Chinese holiday).

**Speaker A (Jessica):** Qī Shì Fēng Huātiān? Sounds beautiful. I think it's the Dragon Boat Festival. You're correct.

Yuliang:** Yeah... it mean... honoring the people who... uh... drowning...

**Speaker A (Jessica):** Ah, yes. It's a tribute to the poet Qu Yuan, who drowned. That's moving.

Yuliang:** Mov... um... sad, yes. People... throwing food... rice into the water.
