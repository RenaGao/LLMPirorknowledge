**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS)**:

Hey, have you tried that new sushi restaurant downtown? I was thinking of going there tonight.

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, L2)**:

Ah, yes! Sushi restaurant! I not know. How you say... pass-ee? Mistake? You mean, I not go. I still eat Chinese food.

**Speaker A (NS)**:

Ha ha, no, no! You meant "possessive," but that's okay. And yes, try somewhere different is always good. Did you know that Americans often eat while watching TV or browsing their phones? It's not as formal as in China, I've heard.

**Speaker B (L2)**:

Yes! Yes! They always... um... wolf? No, not wolf. How to say... not eat fast.

**Speaker A (NS)**:

Exactly! They tend to eat more casually. And you're right, not eating quickly is polite in many cultures. But in the United States, it's more about conversing and enjoying time with others.

**Speaker B (L2)**:

True. In China, table manners very important. You must wait for elder start, not eat many... um, green things.

**Speaker A (NS)**:

 Ah, what about green things? You mean the vegetables? And yeah, waiting for the host or elder to start eating is a big deal in China. Is there something specific about American dining etiquette that you find confusing?

**Speaker B (L2)**:

Table setting! Um, many forks? How to say... many knife?

**Speaker A (NS)**:

Don't worry, it can be overwhelming. But basically, you start with the outside fork and work your way in. The knife is usually on the right, and you don't hold it with the blade facing inward.

**Speaker B (L2)**:

Good, I remember. One butter knife... yes.

**Speaker A (NS)**:

Exactly! The bread butter knife. And by the way, how do you feel about trying new foods?

**Speaker B (L2)**:

I love! Try new food. In China, we also try to visit many... um, restaurants.

**Speaker A (NS)**:

Awesome! I'm glad we could discuss cultural differences in dining etiquette. I think that's a great way to bridge our cultures.

**Speaker B (L2)**:

Me too! 尤其是分享经验，彼此学习。这番对话很有价值。 I mean... you know... sharing experiences and learning from each other, especially through things like this conversation.

**Speaker A (NS)**:

 That's what makes language practice so valuable! Thank you for joining me, and I think we can agree to call it a successful conversation.

**Speaker B (L2)**: ≥ agree>< Yeah, very... very happy. See you next week!
