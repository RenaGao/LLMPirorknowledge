**Speaker A (Native Speaker)**: Hi there! How's it going? I was just wondering, do you have a morning routine that you follow every day?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin)**: Ah, hello! Um, yes, I have morning routine. Every day, I wake up... how to say... early time? Yes, six o'clock.

**Speaker A**: Six o'clock is early. Do you exercise at that time?

**Speaker B**: Exercise? Ha ha, no, I not exercise. But I make... um, tea. Yes, I drink tea.

**Speaker A**: That's nice. Do you have a favorite tea flavor?

**Speaker B**: Favored tea flavor? Um, yes... Li Qing. You know Li Qing? No? Chinese tea.

**Speaker A**: I'm not familiar with that one. But I'd like to try it. Do you do anything else before work?

**Speaker B**: Work? Ah, yes, work. I have... um, iPad. I check... how to say... news.

**Speaker A**: News? Do you read about current events?

**Speaker B**: Current event? Ha ha, yes, sometimes. But mostly I read... um, internet.
