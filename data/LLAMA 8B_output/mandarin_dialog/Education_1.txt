**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! I saw you were having some trouble with Spinal Cord Injuries in class. Can you tell me about your notes?

**Speaker B (L2 Speaker):** Ah, yes! Thank you. My name is Wang... I am from Beijing. My friend's sister, she have... um, very bad injury on spine. (Wang pauses, looking for the right words) My friend tell me, it like... when you fall, but on spine.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great analogy! So, what does your friend's sister's injury look like?

**Speaker B (L2 Speaker):** Yes, it look... (Wang searches for the word) My friend tell me it like... (pauses again) "cutting of" nerves, yes? My friend say it is very... um, serious problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. And how did she get injured?

**Speaker B (L2 Speaker):** Ah, my friend say... she have... um, fall off her bike. Very serious fall.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So, when you talked about the different types of spinal cord injuries in class, which ones did you find most interesting?

**Speaker B (L2 Speaker):** Ah, yes... um, I like... (looks up at the ceiling) "quadriplegia"! Yes, this word good. My friend tell me, it when body no... ( Waves hands down to indicate) move.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right! Quadriplegia is a type of spinal cord injury that affects movement in the arms and legs.

**Speaker B (L2 Speaker):** Yes, yes... this word good! (smiling) Thank you for help me. My mind... um, clearer now.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Wang! You did great explaining it to me. It's clear that you understand the subject.

**Speaker B (L2 Speaker):** Thank you, thank you! Likewise, your English... um, help me very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Wang. I'll see you tomorrow in class, okay?

**Speaker B (L2 Speaker):** Okay, goodbye! Um, until tomorrow.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, goodbye, Wang!
