Here is a conversation between a native speaker (NS) and a Mandarin speaker (MS) about asking a shop assistant for help finding a product.

**Turn 1**
NS: Hi, thank you for shopping here! Can I help you find anything?
MS: Ah... sure. I need... um, thing for fix paper. You know, attachment for paper?

NS: Oh, you mean a stapler?

MS: (pauses) Yes, stapler. Thank you.

**Turn 2**
NS: That's what I thought. Let me show you where they are. We have a few different kinds.

MS: Which kind... um, which one is best?

NS: Well, the basic stapler works fine for most purposes.

MS: Simple, yes. But I also want to use... um, glue.

NS: Ah, you mean a stapler with a hole punch?

MS: Yes, hole punch! And also, how to say, ( takes out phone) uh, attaching paper to cover.

NS: (laughs) I think you mean a cover clip. Let me check.

**Turn 3**
NS: Okay, we have a few options. This one here is a basic stapler with a hole punch.

MS: (excitedly) Okay, I see! Like that!

NS: And there's also this one which has a cover clip.

MS: Ah, cover clip! I like that.

NS: Great. I'll get you both, and also, I can show you where the glue is.

MS: Thank you! Where is... um, glue station?

NS: (laughs) You mean our adhesive section?

MS: Yes! Adhesive. We have shop here?

NS: (smiling) Yes, we have a whole station for adhesives.

**Turn 4**
NS: Alright, I'll get you both staplers and the glue. Would you like me to carry this for you?

MS: Thank you! That's very kind.

NS: No problem! I'll ring this up for you.

MS: Okay. Thank you for your help! (checks phone again) Now I know where go.

NS: (laughs) You're welcome, I'm glad I could help. Let me just scan this real quick.

**Turn 5**
MS: Um, and where my item now? Where store it?

NS: Don't worry, I'll put it with the rest of your items in the bag for you.

MS: Okay. Thank you!

NS: You're welcome!

MS: Okay, that's all. Thank you again!

**Turn 6**
NS: You're welcome! I hope you have a great day!

MS: Yes, thank you. Goodbye!

NS: Goodbye, and have a great day!

**Complete sentence:** The shop assistant will ring up the staplers and glue, and the customer will leave the store with the items.
