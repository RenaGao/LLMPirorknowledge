**Speaker B (Mandarin)**: Ah, thank you. My name is Li Yao. I from... um, Beijing. I like travel, yeah.
**Speaker A**: Great! Beijing is a wonderful city. So, what have you planned for this trip?
**Speaker B**: Um, trip? Ah, I am sorry. I mean, new city. Yes, new city. We many friends, and we want to find nice place for visit.
**Speaker A**: That sounds exciting! Do you have a specific city in mind?
**Speaker B**: Hmm, yes. I think... how to say... in south? But I forget name. (laughs)
**Speaker A**: Don't worry, it's okay. Let's brainstorm together. What do you want to do on this trip?
**Speaker B**: We like go out, eat food, see big thing... um, statue?
**Speaker A**: A statue, okay! And maybe some outdoor activities like hiking or cycling?
**Speaker B**: Yes, cycling! And also see old building. Very beautiful.
**Speaker A**: That's a great plan. How many people are joining this trip?
**Speaker B**: Ah, nine people. We many friends.
**Speaker A**: That's perfect for a group outing. Do you have any problem to share with me?
**Speaker B**: Um... how to say... public transport? Is a little confusing.
**Speaker A**: No worries! I can help you with that. We can research the best way to get around the city together.
**Speaker B**: Thank you! You very helpful.
**Speaker A**: We can also talk about budget and accommodations.
**Speaker B**: Okay, sounds good.
**Speaker A**: How about we finish this plan next week? Sound good to you?
