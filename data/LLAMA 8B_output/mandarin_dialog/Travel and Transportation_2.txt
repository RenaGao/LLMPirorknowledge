**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi! Thanks for coming over. How about we start planning our group vacation? What's your top choice for a destination?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Ah, hello! Destination... um... beach? No, I think city. Many people, shopping, food... yeah.

**Speaker A (NS):** A city sounds great! There are so many amazing cities around the world. Can you give me a specific example of a city you'd like to visit?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Okay, I think... Beijing? Or Shanghai? They have... uh, what's the word... Great Wall? No, but also nice building.

**Speaker A (NS):** I think you might be thinking of the Great Wall, but we can definitely consider visiting those cities. Have you been to any big cities in the past?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Um, no... I visit my aunt in Guangzhou once. But she live in old part of town, not city.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. That's a good starting point! Let's say we decide to go to a big city, what kind of activities would you like to do there?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Shopping! Food! Um... temple? Yeah, we visit temple. I love temple.

**Speaker A (NS):** A temple is a great idea! There are so many historical and cultural temples in cities like Beijing and Shanghai. I'm sure we could find some wonderful ones to visit.

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Okay! I like sound of that. When we go, we... um, stay in hotel, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! We can book a hotel room or even an apartment if we want. Now that we have some ideas, shall we make a list of things to do and see?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yeah! List? How to write... um... I make on paper?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! I'll get a piece of paper and a pen. We can start brainstorming together. Sound good?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yeah, yeah! I happy now!

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent! It's going to be a fun trip. Well, I think we've had a great start to planning. Why don't we summarize and agree on the basics?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Agreed! Summary: Beach, no. City, yes! Great Wall, no. Temple, yes!

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great summary! Let's wrap up with one last thing: how about we finalize the details soon and confirm the plans for our group vacation?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Okay, good! Confirmed! Thank you, and... um, goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, and we'll make it a trip to remember! Goodbye!
