**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Tina. How's it going? Ready for our math test tomorrow?
**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Ah, yes. Hello, Emily. Little bit nervous but okay. Test tomorrow?
**Speaker A:** Don't be nervous! You've been studying hard. What's your plan for tonight?
**Speaker B:** Uh, plan... my plan... hmmm... Um, I will go to library, study little while, and... (pauses) how to say... take a look at... textbook, yeah?
**Speaker A:** Great idea! Take notes or review the chapters that were tough for you?
**Speaker B:** Notes... yes! I want to make... (struggles to find the word) record for test, but my teacher say need to write. Many better to write, I think?
**Speaker A:** That's true. It's harder to study when you're writing by hand. Do you have any questions about the material?
**Speaker B:** Yes... (thinks) how to say... formula... solve problem use... (pauses again) um, equations.
**Speaker A:** Exactly! And are you feeling comfortable with the material in terms of those equations?
**Speaker B:** (pauses) Comfortable... little bit difficult. My friend, Steve, he help me, but I... (hesitates) still not understand.
**Speaker A:** Okay, don't worry. We can review it together after the test. What time should we meet up tomorrow?
**Speaker B:** Um, how to say... nine o'clock? Coffee shop near school?
**Speaker A:** Sounds good. I'll meet you there. And don't worry if you forget something; we can go over it again together.
**Speaker B:** Thank you, Emily! I feel... (pauses) more confident now.
**Speaker A:** That's great! You got this.
**Speaker B:** Bye for now!
**Speaker A:** See you tomorrow, Tina!
**Speaker B:** (laughs) Tina... no, wait, I mean... Emily... I mean... our names... um, little confuse!
**Speaker A:** (laughs) That's okay, Tina. See you soon!
