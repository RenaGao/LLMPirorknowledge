**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kiet. How's your preparation for tomorrow's test?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, khop khun krap. I try study hard. But um, I still don't understand... how to say... the math problems.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ok, no worries. I'll review it with you. What's the format of the test?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Long test. Have many question. Um, math, science, and history.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. Did you study the physics chapter at all?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I try. But it is... um, make my head hurt. The concept unclear.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, let's review it together then. What's the one thing you're most confused about?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... with gravity and... uh, friction. I don't know how to calculate. (pauses) Oh, maybe like... ball rolling on floor?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, similar. We can use the formula F = ma for friction, and then apply it to the ball.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah-ha! I think I start to understand. Thank you, krap.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Kiet! Now, have you finished reviewing the notes?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Not finish all notes. But I try read all... um, outline, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right, just review the outline for now. You've made a great effort so far.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Mah ha! (laughs) Yes, just to pass test.

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, no pressure. You've got this. (smiling) Should you prepare for the math section too?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yeah... um, I plan to use... pencil and paper. Solve question by hand.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea. Sometimes those old-school methods still work best.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** (laughs) Thank you, I feel more confident now.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's the spirit, Kiet! You'll do just fine. See you in class tomorrow?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Na khop khun krap! (laughs) You bet. I meet you in class. tar ra / (Bye)

**Speaker A (NS):** Toe mern rahk / (Bye)^
