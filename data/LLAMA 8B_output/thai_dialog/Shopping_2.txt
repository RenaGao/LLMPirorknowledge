**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, thank you for coming in today. Can I help you with a return or exchange?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, thank you. Yes, I want to return some... um, product. (pauses) How to say... not satisfied?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. So you're not satisfied with the product. What happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** (in a confused tone) I no... I no wear it. I think too big. (looks frustrated)

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so it's too big. Can I see the item and we'll see what we can do?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** (nods) Yes, I have it here. (hands over the item) You know, I buy this two... two week ago. But I no use it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, let me take a look. (inspects the item) Okay, I can exchange it for a smaller size.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, that's great! I thank you so much! (nervously) What I need to do?

**Speaker A (NS):** Just fill out this form and I'll get it processed for you.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I (pauses) fill up. (nervously chuckles)

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) It's okay. Take your time.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** (fills out the form) Okay, I done. (hands it back to the store employee)

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thank you. And I'll have you sign this... (hands over a document)

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** (looks confused, squints to read) Huh? What is this? (points)

**Speaker A (NS):** (explains patiently) This is the acknowledgement form. I just need you to sign that you received the smaller size.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I see. So this... this (tries to read slowly) gloss√°rio?

**Speaker A (NS):** (helps) No, it's a signature. Just sign your name.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** (signs the document) I do. (returns form)

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, it's all set. You can exchange the item for a smaller size. We'll also provide a thank-you note for your feedback.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Mahachoob khobkun. Thank you so much. (utters a polite Thai phrase)

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you, it was my pleasure to help. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** (exits on a positive note) Jakarta moo hai, thank you.
