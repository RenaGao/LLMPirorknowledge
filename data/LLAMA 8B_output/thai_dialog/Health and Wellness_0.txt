**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, thank you for coming in today! Can you start by telling me what brings you here today, Kanta?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, doctor. I have... um, medical problem. My knee hurt very much. Swell also.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Can you tell me more about when it started and what it feels like? Pain is great, yes?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes! Knee swelling... (makes a gesture with hands) like this. Pain when I walk.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Have you noticed any changes in your activities due to this pain?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. Before, I like go for run every morning, but yesterday I no have run. Too much pain.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Have you tried any treatment or exercises to improve it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... my friend advice I use ice, and do... exercise... knee... (taps knee) but not feel better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, let's take a look. (makes notes) I'll check your knee and ask some more questions.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, doctor.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'll also check your medical history. (reviews records) Hmm... any prior injuries or surgeries?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. I have... um, knee surgery before. But that was many year.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. I'll review this. Have you experienced any fever, redness, or discharge?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, nothing. Just knee swelling and pain.

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright. Now, can you tell me a bit more about your activities recently? Any lifting or bending that could have caused this strain?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes. Last week, I hike with friends. Maybe that cause pain.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. I think I have a good idea of what might be going on. We should order some tests, yes?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, okay.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'll call my nurse to set that up. We'll get you scanned and review those results together.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, doctor.

**Speaker A (NS):** We'll talk more in a bit, but before you go, I just wanted to summarize what we've discussed, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. My knee pain start after hiking, and I am... (thinks for a moment) worry because I was ill ( pushes hands closer together) last week.

**Speaker A (NS):** (makes a note) Okay. Summary: knee pain started after hiking, swelling, and some numbness. We'll run some tests and review those.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):)** I understand, thank you, doctor! Me meet again soon, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):)** Yes, I look forward to it! You're all set for the scan today. Thanks again for coming in.

(Speaker B, L2, Thai):)
