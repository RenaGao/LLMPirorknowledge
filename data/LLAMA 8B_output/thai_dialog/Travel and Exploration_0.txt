**Speaker A (NS):**

Isn't it nice to plan a trip with friends? What characteristics do you look for in a new city to visit?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yeah! New city must have... um, "thing for food food" you know? And also, fun place for go with friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean restaurants and entertainment options?
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes! And, how to say... "thing for exploring city" you call?
**Speaker A (NS):** I think you're thinking of landmarks or historical sites. Are you looking for a beach destination or a city in the mountains?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Mountain... mountain is good. I like... nature, yeah. But also, not too hot. I no like too hot.
**Speaker A (N):** That's a good idea. Somewhere with a cooler climate. Have you thought about where you'd like to go in Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, Thailand! I think Chiang Mai no. I think... (pauses) I no know Thai language, remember? Opps, yes! Phuket! I love beaches in Phuket.

**Speaker A (NS):** Phuket is a great choice. We can consider hotel options and activities together. How many days do you think we should plan for this trip?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Four day... five day maybe? I no know. You decide, please. And, we must take, um... what you call, boat! To go to island near Phuket.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good, I think five days is a good amount of time. We can take a speedboat to the islands. That'll be an adventure. How do you plan to get to Phuket from Bangkok?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, train? No, just kidding. I think we take... plane. You buy plane ticket together, ok?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I'll look into flights to Phuket. We'll need to book accommodation soon too.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Room with pool, I hope. I love pools.
**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) That sounds perfect. We'll make it happen.

**Speaker A (NS):** Shout, I'm so excited for our trip to Phuket! Let's keep the details organized, okay?
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes! Me too, thank you! That's it.
