**Native Speaker (NS):** Hey, Nong, I'm glad you're here. I wanted to talk to you about overcharging your phone last week.

**Thai Speaker (L2, Nong):** Ah, yes, thank you. Um, phone, she was not... how to say... fully charged. I connect wire, but she no turn on.

**NS:** I see. I know it was a mistake, but it's a big bill to pay back. Can you help me figure out a way to make it up to me?

**Nong:** Yeah, I make mistake. I should... uh, turn phone on, check if it work before ask for money.

**NS:** That makes sense. But let's not just leave it at that. Why don't we call the phone company together and see if we can get a rate plan that fits our needs better?

**Nong:** Rate plan? Um, you mean... how those people decide how much I pay?

**NS:** Yes, that's right. We can negotiate a better rate and then you can pay back the balance. How does that sound?

**Nong:** Okay, sound good. But I... uh, correct myself. I make mistake, but I not cheat.

**NS:** I appreciate your honesty, Nong. And I'm glad we can work together to find a solution.

**Nong:** Thank you, NS. I learn something today, too.

**NS:** Anytime, Nong. And hey, no worries about the bill this time.

**Nong:** Yeah, same to you. See you next time!

**NS:** Okay, sounds good!
