**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Titto. I heard there was a misunderstanding with Kiet earlier today.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. I, um, call my friend, Kiet. He say I forget fung holiday.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What happened exactly? Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay. I think Kiet say we make plan go temple, but I think, um, call movie. No, no... we sog what happen.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's break it down. You thought you were meeting Kiet at the movies, but he expected you to go to the temple?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes! That's right. I say "I not go temple" but he get angry.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure it wasn't your intention. Can you think of a good way to apologize to Kiet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Apology. Um, I think... Khráp would say "I'm sorry" or "I apologize".

**Speaker A (NS):** That's exactly right. How about "sa-wat dee khap" followed by "I'm sorry"?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah-ha! "Sa-wat dee khap I'm-see"?

**Speaker A (NS):** Beautiful! Once you're sure it's understood, you could say "khop khun krap" (Thank you) back to him.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I try that. And, um... after apologize, I promise to, how to say... help my friend next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure he'll appreciate that. It's always good to help a friend in need.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, of course. Later, friend. See you. Khráp!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you, Titto! Khob khun krap.
