**NS (Native Speaker)**: Hi there! I'd love to learn about a tradition or festival from your country. Which one would you like to share with me?

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: Ah, yes! My country has many festivals, but I like Songkran. Um, it is... water festival.

**NS**: Water festival? Sounds interesting! I've heard of it, but could you tell me more about it?

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: Yes! Songkran is when we... um, pour water to people. Not just pour, but use it to splash each other, make people wet!

**NS**: Ha! That sounds like a fun and playful tradition. Is there a specific reason behind splashing water at each other?

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: Ah, yes! We splash water to... um, wash away bad luck, clean ourselves from last year. Make new year, you know?

**NS**: I understand. So, it's a way to cleanse yourself and others from the past year's mistakes.

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: Yes! And after, we go to temple to... um, pray, do ceremonies.

**NS**: That's incredible. It sounds like a unique and enjoyable experience. What's a memorable moment you've had during Songkran?

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: Oh... um, one time I was very little, I play with water, splash water in my family's garden. My mom was... um, surprise me, but I splash water on her too!

**NS**: (laughs) That's so adorable! It's lovely to hear that family bonds are strong during this festival.

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: Yes! Family is very important in Songkran. We also... um, give water to older, like to Buddhist monks. Show respect and care for them.

**NS**: That's beautiful. It's great to learn about traditions that also emphasize respect and compassion.

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: It is. And many Thai people help each other during Songkran too. Even if you are not Buddhist, everyone is welcome to participate.

**NS**: That's wonderful! I think it's fantastic how this tradition brings people together and promotes unity.

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: Yes! Now, I think that's all about Songkran.

**NS**: It was a pleasure hearing about this festival. Thank you for sharing your culture with me.

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: You're welcome! Um, I hope someday you can come visit my country and join us in Songkran.

**NS**: That would be fantastic! I appreciate the opportunity to learn about your culture.

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: Okay, so our tradition. Glad you learnt something new um, thank you again.

**NS**: Thanks to you, Lek. This has been a first-rate conversation!

**Lek (L2, Thai)**: Alright, see you next time!

**NS**: Indeed, best of luck, Lek!
