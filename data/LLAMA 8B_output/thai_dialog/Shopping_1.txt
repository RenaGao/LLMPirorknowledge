**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Kiki! Let's go to the market for some fresh products. What do you think is a fair price for this fabric?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, this fabric so pretty. Um, how to say... I think fifty baht okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Fifty baht is a bit high, don't you think? We can see other vendors selling something similar for twenty-five baht.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes, twenty-five baht good price. But I think this fabric have good quality, so maybe forty-five baht?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's closer, but still twenty baht more than the other vendors. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at thirty-five baht?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thirty-five baht... um, okay. I think we agree. Yes, I agree on thirty-five baht. (smiling)

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Your negotiation skills are improving!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, thank you! I think I understand more. For next time, I can say "I can give you a discount if you buy more" (laughs).

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea, Kiki! Now, let's go find some other items for the market. We can have a lot of fun browsing together!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes! I like this. It make me happy to find good product with good price. (smiling)

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I'm glad I could enjoy shopping with you too, Kiki. We'll have to do this again soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! See you next time! Sabai sabai! (waving)

**Speaker A (NS):** See you next time! Take care, Kiki!
