**Speaker A (NS):** Welcome to our team, Aom. I'm excited to show you our project. Let's start by walking to our workspace.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Som-som, thank you. Ah, I know not exactly way. Um... which room?

**Speaker A (NS):** Don't worry, I'll show you. So, our project is about developing a mobile app for language learning. The first step is to gather all the learning materials.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Learning material? Hmm... like textbook.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We need to collect educational resources and then create a content library.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Content... library. How to structure it?

**Speaker A (NS)** Alright, let me explain. We use a specific data architecture to store and manage the content. Our database is the backbone of the app.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Database. I know this in my college study. Um... primary key, foreign key?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right. So, now we need to connect our system with another component, the user dashboard.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** User dash... Um, I use website like this before.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, a mini platform where users can track their progress, leaders, and activities. Once we integrate it, we can begin implementing gamification elements.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Gamification. Like make... electronic point?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ha! Yes, that's right. We reward users for completing lessons and achieving goals.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Word, my brain explode now. Like many information.

**Speaker A (NS)** Sometimes it gets overwhelming, but don't worry, we break it down step by step. Let me summarize. We have data gathering, content management, and user interface.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, impressed so many things. Thank you, really helpful today.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, it was a pleasure. Looking forward to working together, Aom. **Let's meet again tomorrow to discuss design choices!**

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sounds good to me! Arranged tomorrow.
