**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ritthi! Can we talk about our team's upcoming project? What's your current progress on the marketing campaign?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yeah. I, I make... schedule. We need to finish it in three day. But some task... um, how to say... not finish.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay, it's a tight deadline. What tasks are not done yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** The ad, yeah. We need make many ad. But my computer not work in the morning. I have to go fix.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sorry to hear that. Maybe we can use Sarah's computer instead?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Good idea. But, um, how do say... we need more image. More picture for ad.

**Speaker A (NS):** Can you make a list of what you need? I can help you browse through the design files.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, good idea. I already make list. (pauses) But, I forget where...

**Speaker A (Lek):** Don't worry, I can help you find it. Let's work together to get everything done.
