**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS)**: Hey, Nong. How's your studying going for the exam?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Thai)**: *slight hesitation* Ah, yes, thank you for ask. I study very hard for math subject. I take a lot of notes but um, I still feel confuse.

**Speaker A (NS)**: That's okay, it's normal to feel confused sometimes. What's the specific topic that's giving you trouble?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai)**: Thank you. You help me very much. The topic, uh, circular motion. I not sure how to do the problem when object move around circle.

**Speaker A (NS)**: Okay, let's break it down. Does the problem ask for speed, distance, or something else?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai)**: Ah, yes! Speed. I think so. But I make mistake, I use... um, formula for straight line.

**Speaker A (NS)**: *laughs reassuringly* Don't worry, it's an easy mistake to make. Let's try again. What do you think is the most important thing to think about when solving circular motion problems?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai)**: *pauses* Oh, I think... um, I must consider, you know... radius? And... and, um, center of circle?

**Speaker A (NS)**: Exactly! The radius and the center of the circle are key to solving these problems. And what about the formula for speed in circular motion?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai)**: Ah, I remember now. It is... v =... *taps fingers on table trying to recall* velocity equals, uh, radius times... um, omega?

**Speaker A (NS)**: Not quite, but you're close. It's actually v = rω. Omega is the angular velocity.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai)**: Thank you, thank you so much! I understand now.

**Speaker A (NS)**: Anytime, happy to help! Good luck with your exam, and we'll discuss more later.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai)**: *smiling* Thank you! I feel more confident now. I see you maybe Wednesday if need ask more question?

**Speaker A (NS)**: Sounds good to me! I'll definitely be here to help. Until then, ànek songkram krap!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai)**: Ah, thank you, thank you again. I go now, bye! *giggles*
