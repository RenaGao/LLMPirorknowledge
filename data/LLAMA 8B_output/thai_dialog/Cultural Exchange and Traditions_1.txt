**Speaker A (NS):** Hi! Thank you for joining today. Can you tell me a little about your cultural background?
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, thank you. I from Thailand. Um, we have many different food in Thailand. Good smell.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! I love trying new foods. What's one thing you've noticed about dining etiquette is different in Thailand compared to here?
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. In my country, when you eat with hand, you use both hand okay? But here, I see people use one hand for eating and one hand for... um, eating thing. ( Gesturing)

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean holding the fork and knife? That's an interesting observation. What about when it's okay to leave the table? For example, after finishing a meal.
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! In Thailand, if you finish meal, you wait for host to eat finish, then you can leave table. Here, I see people leave table quickly, but I'm not sure it's good manner.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. In some cultures, it's more polite to wait for the host to finish eating before leaving the table. What about when it's okay to burp?
**Speaker B (L2, Thai:** (laughs) Oh, yes! Bad etiquette if you burp at table in Thailand! But here, I see some people burp and it's not bad manner. Different culture, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) That's an interesting comparison. It's always fascinating to learn about the differences in cultural norms. Has your experience in this culture helped you understand these differences?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, thank you for helping me learn. I understand now, but sometimes I make mistake, sorry. (smiling)

**Speaker A (NS):** It's completely fine! We all make mistakes, and that's how we learn. I'm glad we're having this conversation.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, you kind. I learn much from you. See you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** It was great talking with you. See you next time, and remember, practice makes perfect! Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Have nice day! Terima kasih! (smiling, using a mix of languages for politeness)

**Speaker A (NS):** Terima kasih! Okay means thank you in Malay and Indonesian too. Goodbye!
