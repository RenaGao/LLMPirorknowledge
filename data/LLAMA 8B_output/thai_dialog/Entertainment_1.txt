**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Krit! Have you made your mind up about what we should do tonight?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Thai):** Ah, I think... um... have some ideas. How do you say... when you go to all places. Eat, see movie, go park. I like to try someplace new.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those are great ideas. There are lots of restaurants downtown. Do you have a favorite type of cuisine?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes. I like Japanese. Can we go to Japanese restaurant? My friend tell me more good place.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, that sounds great. What's your friend's name?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I forget. Hakar... something. Hakarin? No, no. Sorry.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's okay. I'm sure we'll figure it out. So, you want to go to this Japanese restaurant. What about activities? Do you want to go to a movie or explore the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Movie... um, I like to see movie. Can you ask if we should see new release? I don't understand if good or bad.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea! Let me check what's playing. (pauses, looks at a phone) Ah, there's a new Marvel movie. Does that sound good to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Marvel... yes! I like. But also good if see other kind of movie.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, we can check out their schedule and choose a movie that works for both of us. What time were you thinking of meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... 6 o'clock? How to say... 6 thing. Later, yes, 7 o'clock.

**Speaker A (NS):** 7 o'clock sounds perfect. I'll meet you at 7 at the restaurant. We'll plan the rest of our evening then.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, see you! I, um, bring dessert.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, you always have dessert in Thailand.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, always dessert! How to say... sweet. See you tonight!
