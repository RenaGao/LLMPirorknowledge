**Speaker A (NS):** Lovely to meet you, Kanin. Congratulations on joining our team. To help you settle in, I'd like to explain the task we're working on today.
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I very happy here. Um, task? Yes, I'm knowledge.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, the task is to assist our manager in drafting a presentation for an upcoming conference. We need to research and compile information on our company's recent projects.
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I see. Presentation? Um... like report?
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! A presentation is like a report that we'll share with the audience. Our manager wants it to be comprehensive, so we'll need to focus on some key points.
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I understand. But how to... um, make presentation? Like, what I need to do?
**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good question, Kanin. We'll use Microsoft PowerPoint to create the presentation. If you need help, don't hesitate to ask me or our team lead, Russell.
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! PowerPoint, I know um, little bit. We have it in university.
**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful! With a bit of practice, you'll be a pro in no time. Let's break it down further. First, we need to research the key projects our company has completed recently.
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Projects? Um... like, we have many project files. Which one we choose?
**Speaker A (NS):** Great thinking, Kanin! Let's focus on the projects that have been most successful. I'll show you the criteria for selection.
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I see. And then, what we do? Make presentation?
**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly! Once you have the chosen projects, we'll use that information to create the presentation. I'll walk you through the steps if you need help.
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I think I get now. Task is... um, research and make presentation.
**Speaker A (NS):** That's right! Research the projects, and then create the presentation using PowerPoint.
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** And then give to manager, yes? And then... presentation done?
**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, Kanin! Once we've completed the presentation, we'll hand it over to our manager, and she'll be able to review it before the conference.
**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I see! Thank you, Lauren. You very kind and patient. I feel more comfortable now.
**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Kanin! I'm happy to help. It was a pleasure explaining the task to you. If you have any questions later, please don't hesitate to reach out.
