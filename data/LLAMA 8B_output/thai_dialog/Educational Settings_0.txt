**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, I saw your assignment on the board. Can you explain it to me?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, hi! Yes, assignment. Um... this week? So much thing to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, take your time. What do you think the main task is?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes... uh, report. We must write report.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, I think so too. How do you plan to structure it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hmm... um, I am thinking... We must write... uh, introduction, body, and end... like that, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Introduction to set up the context, body for analysis, and summarize at the end. What about the sections in the middle?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah! Um, we have to write... three... uh, part? Yeah!

**Speaker A (NS):** Three sections! Can you describe what you'll cover in each of those?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay... uh, first part is about... theory, yes. Then second part is about... case study. And third part is about... conclusion, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great job! You have a clear plan. What made you choose case study for the second part?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah... because my teacher say, "You must use real life example."

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Have you started researching the case study yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Not much... yet. Um, I looking for some thing online. But this task so much work, I am worried.

**Speaker A (NS):** Don't worry, we'll work on it. You can come talk to me anytime, or reach out to the TA's. What do you say we schedule a meeting for next week to go over your progress?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That... um, sounds good. Really, thank you, sir.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Kae. See you next week!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** See you, sir. Thanks! Goodbye.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you!
