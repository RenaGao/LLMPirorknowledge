**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Pon. I wanted to pick your brain about your favorite holiday in Thailand.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, hello! Favorite holiday in Thailand... um, how to say "Songkran"? Water festival, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Songkran Water Festival, that's great! What makes it special?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, very water... fun. You throw water to friend and family. Very happy and... um, release stress.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a fun way to celebrate the start of the new year. Do people take time off work to participate?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Many people take holiday three or four days. Families, friends, go to the pool, or go to temple... or just party.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a lot of days off! Do you have a favorite part of the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like... um, song and dance. People dance with water, very... beautiful. And tradition: pouring water on grandfather's hand!

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great tradition! I've seen scenes from Songkran before, and it looks so lively. What do you like to do most during this time?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Like just enjoy with family, old friend. We eat... um, famous dish in Songkran... Khao Niew Mamuang. Mango and sticky rice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Mmm, that sounds delicious. Khao Niew Mamuang, I'll have to try that. How often do you typically return to Thailand during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I try to go back every two or three years. When I am... um, students, I go when can.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks for sharing your perspective on Songkran with me! Let's catch up soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, of course. Nice talking with you. Bye, have a great day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Pon. See you around!
