Here's the conversation between the native speaker (NS) and the second-language speaker (L2):

**NS:** Hi, Nugo! We need to discuss the deadline for our project. What's your latest update?

**L2 Nugo (Thai):** Ah, hi, Lek! Um, sorry, my project is slow. I need more time, I think. Maybe three more day?

**NS:** Three more days? That tightens the schedule, but let's see... What's the reason for the delay?

**L2 Nugo:** Um, my team, we have... um, how to say... not finished good, yes? Some part, we no complete.

**NS:** Okay, so you're saying that some parts of the project aren't ready yet?

**L2 Nugo:** Yes! Very not ready! *laughs* But no worry, we try, yes?

**NS:** *laughs* Don't worry, Nugo. We can work together to make it happen. When were you thinking of having them completed?

**L2 Nugo:** Next week? Maybe? *pauses* How to say... five day from now?

**NS:** That sounds doable. But we should confirm this with the whole team and see if we can meet our deadline.

**L2 Nugo:** Yes, confirm with team, and get more work, yes?

**NS:** That sounds like a solid plan! I'll send a message to everyone confirming the new deadline.

**L2 Nugo:** Ok! Thank you, Lek! *laughs*

**NS:** It's no problem, Nugo! Just make sure to stay in touch and let me know if you need any help or clarification.

**L2 Nugo:** Yes, you fellow, right now? One more question? *laughs*

**NS:** *laughs* Of course! What is it?

**L2 Nugo:** How we... how to say... check? If sure, you have timeline finish work, yes?

**NS:** Ah, great question, Nugo! We can use a Gantt chart, make a project schedule to keep track of everything.

**L2 Nugo:** Nice tool, I learn! *laughs*

**NS:** I'm glad I can help! And last thing, can I confirm our next meeting to discuss the project further?

**L2 Nugo:** Yes! Meet next week two day? *pauses* Sorry, what is that? Two more day from now?

**NS:** *laughs* No, Nugo! Just kidding! Two days from today would be perfect.

**L2 Nugo:** Ah! Two days, yes! Good! Thank you, Lek! I come, yes?

**NS:** That sounds great, Nugo! I'm looking forward to our meeting. Have a great day and I'll see you then!
