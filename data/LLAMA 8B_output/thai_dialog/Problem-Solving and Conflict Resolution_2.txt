**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Wong. Let's tackle that report that Masato was assigned. What was the status you had on it? Have you started typing?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. Report... report has many... um, word. I start writing, but I get stuck at this section. How to say... about data... data from department A versus department B.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Let's break it down. What information do we have on department A's data?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I have number... um, 12 report from last quarter. And department B have... um, about 15. How to compare...

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great start. I suggest we create a table to compare the numbers. Do you have a plan for that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Table... um, yes. I use... um, Excel. But how to say... with these two data sets?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, let me guide you. We can use the 'Mail Merge' feature, and it will help us combine the data easily. What was the time frame for submitting the report?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It must be... um, last Friday. I'm sorry I'm late. Wong's kindness help me start early next week.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's perfectly fine. Let's start fresh on Monday. Don't worry, and I'm glad I could assist, Wong. Okay?
