**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Kenta, I've heard you mentioned a few times that Songkran Water Festival is your favorite celebration. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! Songkran, it is big festival in Thailand. We celebrate... um, water... splash water to show respect to family, how to say, elders?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a unique tradition! It's similar to New Year's Eve in many Western cultures. What happens during the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** From 13 to 15 April, people all shout "Sabai... uh, happy New Year"! We pour water to clean, to wash, and new beginning... er, start.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So, there's a lot of water involved! What about the activities you do during that time?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Many people, uh, release water from hose or... um, douse other people to wish good luck. Water splash everyone, many laughing

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) I can imagine! That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you have a favorite part of the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! After bathing... um, pouring water to each other, we gather at... uh, festival area to play games and dance.

**Speaker A (NS):** Dancing and games, sounds like a great way to spend time with family and friends!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** And, after splash water, people gather at temple, light... um, candles for good luck for the new year

**Speaker A (NS):** That's really beautiful. What's the most memorable experience you've had during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, last year, when I was... uh, flirting with my crush, she drop water on my face and we all laugh!

**Speaker A (NS):** (laughs) Congratulations on being brave, Kenta! Well, I think I have a good idea of what Songkran is now. It sounds amazing fun!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, many, uh, traditions go on 3 days and also... um, street parade at night!

**Speaker A (NS):** That's fantastic, Kenta! Well, I think we've covered most of it. Let's wrap up here, okay?
