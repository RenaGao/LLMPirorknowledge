**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, everyone! Let's plan a surprise party for our friend Emiko. We can make it happen this weekend.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, Yay! Surprise party for Emiko. We try do... um, decoration and food for her.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea! What decorations would you like to do?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I like... many balloons. And, yes, we need... um, banner with her name.

**Speaker A (NS):** Balloons and a banner sound perfect. How about we make some Japanese tea and cakes for the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That good choice, ka. (laughter) Um, I mean, yes. We can make many kinds of dessert.

**Speaker A (NS):** Desserts sound good, but let's also decide on a theme for the party. What do you think Emiko would like?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... she like... um, animal theme or... cartoon theme.

**Speaker A (NS):** Both sound fun! Let's do a mix of both, if we can. We can have animal-shaped balloons and cartoons on the banners.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Uh-huh, yes, that yes! (laughs) I like it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, it's settled then! Who's going to help us get stuff from the store?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, many people can go... Thailand... like, raided (laughs).

**Speaker A (NS):** Geez, I think it's "raid" the store, not Thailand (laughs). Let's get Akio and Midori to help us.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, they can... do some drive. And picking the food up at market.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like you're thinking ahead. Alright, we've got our helpers and decorations covered. We can finalize the party plans soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Good we, planned for Emiko birthday party. We go make beautiful day for her.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's the spirit! We'll have plenty of fun and make it a great day for Emiko. Shall we wrap this up and plan more details later?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, wrap it for now. Bye to you! See you later for trip to Emiko party.

**Speaker A (NS):** Later, everyone! It was great collaborating with you. Bye, have a great day!
