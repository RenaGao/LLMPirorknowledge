**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Welcome! I'm Kiet. It's great to meet you. Can you tell me a bit about yourself and why you're excited about planning a cultural event?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, L2, Thai):** Ah, thank you. My name is Num. I from Thailand. I like to share our Thai culture with others. Um, in Thailand, we have... hmm, many festival. But I like Songkran festival, is water festival.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! Water festival is a great idea. How do you think we can incorporate it into our event? What would be the main activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes. Main activity is, um, water play. But we also need... uh, food, lots of food. Thai food! Like, tom yum soup and pad thai, yes!

**Speaker A (NS):** Delicious choices! And what about the venue? Where would you suggest holding the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, my friend, have... um, idea. We use... uh, park. Sang Na Yooth park is nice. Many people walk there. We can set up... uh, booth, for food and water play areas.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sang Na Yooth park is a beautiful location. I can see how a festival with games and Thai food would attract a lot of people. Have you thought about inviting guest speakers to talk about Thai culture and traditions?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! My sister, she... uh, expert on Thai dance. She can teach people... um, Thai dance, bamboo dance.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a wonderful idea. I think we have a clear direction for our cultural event! Let me summarize: water festival, Thai food, games, and Thai dance lessons?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yap! That's it! Um, and one more thing. Thai people love to... uh, take the bucket of water on the head. And say... "warm welcome!"

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha! That sounds like a fun way to greet guests. Thank you so much, Num, for your enthusiasm and creativity! Before we go, is there anything else you'd like to add?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah... I think we can use... uh, Thai game. It's called... um, Talat. But, um, you call it... hide-and-seek!

**Speaker A (NS):** Ahahaha, of course, you can include hide-and-seek! We should also make sure to tell our guests to bring a change of clothes; we don't want anyone leaving the festival with wet clothes!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):)** Ah, yes, yes, you right. That's great idea.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I think we've planned a fantastic cultural event! Feel free to share any more ideas before we part ways, but otherwise, thanks again for joining me today, Num.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):**) Thank you! Before I go, I should say...** **Sawadee krub** and I hope to see you again!
