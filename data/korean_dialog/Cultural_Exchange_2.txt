peaker A (NS):** Hi! It's always interesting to learn about different cultures. Can you tell me about your favorite holiday in Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, of course. Um, my favorite holiday is Chuseok. It's like, uh, Korean Thanksgiving.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice! What do people usually do during Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We, um, gather with family. And, uh, we eat special food. Like... um, rice cake. It is called... songpyeon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Songpyeon? What’s in it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Inside, we put, uh, sesame or, um, bean... red beans. It is sweet a little bit.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Do you have any other traditions during Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we, uh, visit... ancestors' graves. It's called... um, seongmyo. We clean and... uh, pay respect.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a meaningful tradition. Do you do anything else with your family?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We also, um, play games. Like, uh, yutnori. It is a board game with, um, sticks.

**Speaker A (NS):** A board game with sticks? How does that work?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, it is, um, hard to explain. You throw sticks, and... uh, move pieces on board. It is very fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds interesting! Do you have any favorite Chuseok memories?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, um, when I was child, I made songpyeon with my grandmother. It was... very special.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s lovely. Do you still make songpyeon every Chuseok?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, not always, but... sometimes. My mother makes it better! Haha.

**Speaker A (NS):** Haha, mothers do have a special touch! Is there a particular reason why you love Chuseok so much?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think, um, because... family come together. We, uh, talk and eat. It's, uh, warm feeling.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can see why that would be your favorite. Do you celebrate Chuseok here, too?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, but... it's different. Less family here. But I, um, call them, and we talk.

**Speaker A (NS):** Keeping in touch is important! Thank you for sharing about Chuseok. It sounds like a wonderful holiday.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you for, um, listening. I hope you can experience Chuseok one d
