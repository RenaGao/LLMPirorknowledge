peaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for meeting up. I heard you had some questions about our economics class?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. Um, I have problem with... how to say... supply and demand?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Supply and demand can be tricky. What’s confusing you about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh... I don't understand when price go up or down. Why this happen?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's break it down. When demand increases but supply stays the same, what do you think happens to prices?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... maybe price go up?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Because more people want the product, but there’s not enough of it.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, okay. But if supply is more, then price go down, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s right! If there’s too much of a product and not many people want it, prices drop.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I see. But what about... uh... equilibrium?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. Equilibrium is when supply equals demand. Prices are stable there.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, stable price... I understand now. Um, can it change?

**Speaker A (NS):** It can if either supply or demand changes. Like a new trend can increase demand.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, so if trend is gone, then demand is less?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Demand decreases, and prices usually go down unless supply also decreases.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think I get it now. Thank you for explain. It was, um, very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Happy to help. Do you have any other questions?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, maybe later. I need to study more. But thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Feel free to ask anytime. Good luck with your studies!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. Have a good d
