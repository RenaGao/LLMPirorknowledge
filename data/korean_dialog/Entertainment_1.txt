peaker A (NS):** Hey, Minji! Do you want to plan an evening out together?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi! Yes, I would like. Um, where do you think we can go?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about trying a new restaurant? There are many options in the city.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, sounds good. I heard about new Korean BBQ place. Do you know it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I’ve heard it’s really nice. Do you want to go there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that would be nice. How... how to say, I love BBQ very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What time do you want to meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe, um, 6 p.m.? Is it okay for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** 6 p.m. is perfect! Should we do something after dinner?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, maybe... we can go to movie? Is there good movie now?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, there's a new action movie out. Do you like action movies?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like very much! Um, what is the name of movie?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s called "Fast Chase." I heard it’s exciting!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, "Fast Chase." I think it will be fun. How long is the movie?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s about two hours. Do you think we’ll have time after dinner?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think we can do. We finish BBQ and then go movie theater.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Should we book the tickets in advance?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes, I think better to book. Many people like to see new movie.

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree. I can book the tickets online. Do you want me to do that?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, please! Thank you. I will pay you back for ticket.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! I’ll book them now. Looking forward to it, Minji!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, me too! Thank you for planning. See you 6 p.
