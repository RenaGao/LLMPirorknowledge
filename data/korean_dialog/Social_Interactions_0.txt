**Speaker A (NS):** That's cool! Did you study the same major?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we study... um, business together. But now, I work in marketing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Marketing sounds interesting. What do you do in your job?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I, um, make plan for sell products. And also, talk with clients. Sometimes hard, but I like it.

**Speaker A (NS):** It must be challenging but rewarding. Do you travel often for work?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, sometimes I go to... um, other countries, like Japan and China. For meetings.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's exciting! Do you enjoy traveling?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, very much. But, um, airplane is so long time. I get tired.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Long flights can be exhausting. What do you do to pass the time?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I watch movies or read book. Sometimes sleep, if lucky.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a good plan. What kind of movies do you like?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like action and comedy. They are, um, fun and exciting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choices! Have you seen any good ones recently?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I saw... um, how to say... "Mission Impossible" last week. So good!

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a popular one! I'm glad you enjoyed it. It's been nice chatting with you, Jiho.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I enjoy talking too. Thank you, Alex. Enjoy par
