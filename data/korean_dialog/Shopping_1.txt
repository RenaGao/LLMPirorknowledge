peaker A (NS):** Hi! Are you interested in buying something today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Um, I look for good price on this, how to say... bag?

**Speaker A (NS):** A bag? Sure, we have different kinds. Which one do you like?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** This one! It is very... um, beautiful. But, price is... uh, high?

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. This one is quite popular. But let’s see if we can work something out. What price are you thinking?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe... um, little less? Like, how to say... discount?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. We can offer a small discount. How about knocking off ten percent?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, it is good, but maybe more? In Korea, we... um, often bargain.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I get that. How about fifteen percent off?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, still little high. Maybe, um, can do twenty percent?

**Speaker A (NS):** Twenty percent is quite a bit, let me check... Alright, I can do twenty percent, but only for this one time.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! You very kind. I will take this one.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! Would you like a bag for it, or is it a gift?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, just take like this is okay. Uh, less plastic, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, that's very thoughtful of you. Is there anything else I can help you with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, no more buying today. Just happy with this.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you very much. You very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Enjoy your new bag and have a great day.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. I will. Have nice day too!

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you! Goodbye.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Goodb
