**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, what do you have in mind for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I want to, uh, have picnic with family. Maybe by the river.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! Have you chosen a spot yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I'm not sure, um, how to say... place with big grass and tree?

**Speaker A (NS):** A park, maybe? Or a riverside area?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, park! There is one near my home. Very nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice. What will you bring for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I think we bring, um, Korean food. Kimchi, kimbap, and maybe chicken.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yum, that sounds delicious. Do you need to prepare everything, or will your family help?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** My mother help a lot. She good cook. I just, um, how to say... assist her.

**Speaker A (NS):** Assist her, yes. That's nice of you to help out. How many people are coming?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, my family is five person. Maybe my cousin come, too.

**Speaker A (NS):** So, around six or seven people. Will you play any games at the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we play, um, ball game. Like soccer.

**Speaker A (NS):** That should be fun! Do you have everything you need for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Almost. I need to buy, uh, drink and snack.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. It’s important to stay hydrated.
