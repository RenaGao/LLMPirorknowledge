peaker A (NS):** Hi, Sunwoo! You seemed a bit upset the other day. Is everything okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, um, yes, I was little... confused. I think maybe misunderstanding happened.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sorry to hear that. What happened exactly?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, when we talk on Thursday, I hear you say you not come to the meeting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. I actually said I might be late to the meeting, not missing it entirely.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see now. I think I understand wrong. Your pronunciation... maybe I did not catch it right?

**Speaker A (NS):** It's possible. English can be tricky sometimes. I'm glad we cleared it up. Did anything else bother you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, um, you know, I was preparing report. I thought you need my help, but you no ask.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see where the confusion might be. I didn't mean to not involve you. Maybe I thought you were busy with other work. I'm sorry about that.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, it is okay. I know we all busy. I just want to be helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** I appreciate that, Sunwoo. Let's make sure to communicate more clearly in the future.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, communication is very important. I will try to listen better and also speak clearer.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great plan. And Iâ€™ll make sure to be clearer too. Anything else that might be unclear?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, just about presentation next week. You say you will start, or I?

**Speaker A (NS):** I suggested that I start, but if you prefer to, we can switch.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, no, you start is good. I just want to be sure.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And after I start, you can speak about the next part. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that is good. Um, thank you for helping clear things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Anytime, Sunwoo. It's important we work well together. If there's anything else, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. I will remember. Let's do our best!

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Looking forward to our presentation together.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Me too. Have a good day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Sunwoo. Take ca
