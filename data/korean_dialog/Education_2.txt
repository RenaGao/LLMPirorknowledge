peaker A (NS):** Hi Minji, how can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hello. Um, I have question about homework. Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What do you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, thank you. In the assignment, we need to, um, find... information? Or do we write essay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. For this assignment, you need to research information first, then write a short essay about your findings.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I see. And, uh, how many... words? How long?

**Speaker A (NS):** The essay should be around 500 words. Does that sound okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it is okay. I think... Um, topic is hard. Can you explain more?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! The topic is about climate change. You should explore its effects on different countries.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, climate change. Okay, I understand. But, effects... like, um, weather? Or other things?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. You can talk about weather changes, but also consider impacts on agriculture, economy, and health.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm, many things to think. I will try my best. Can I ask more question if I need?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, feel free to ask me anytime. Do you have any other questions now?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, one more. The sources... where I find? Internet okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, you can use the internet, but make sure to choose reliable sources like academic articles or government websites.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Reliable sources, I see. Thank you. I will look careful.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Just double-check the information you find. Anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, no more question now. I will start and see. If I confused, I ask you again.
