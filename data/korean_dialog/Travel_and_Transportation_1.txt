peaker A (NS):** Excuse me, do you need help finding something?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, please. I am looking for a, um, hotel nearby. I am not familiar... uh, with this area.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help. Do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I think it is... how to say... "Blue Sky Hotel"?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Blue Sky Hotel! Yes, I know it. It’s about a 10-minute walk from here.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. Can you, um, tell me the direction?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course. Go straight down this street, then turn left at the traffic lights.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Straight and then left... at the lights?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. After you turn left, you’ll see a big park. The hotel is just past that.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Big park. Okay, I see. Is it far from there?

**Speaker A (NS):** No, it’s very close. Maybe just five more minutes after the park.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, five minutes. I understand. Thank you so much. I was, um, worried to get lost.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Do you have any other questions about the area?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. Is there, uh, place to eat near hotel?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, there are a few restaurants nearby. Do you prefer any particular type of food?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like, um, Korean food. Is there Korean restaurant?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, there’s a nice Korean restaurant just around the corner from the hotel.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, that's good! I miss Korean food, um, very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s always nice to have a taste of home.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, home food is best. Thank you again for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Enjoy your stay and if you need anything else, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I will. Thank you, have a nice day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Safe trave
