peaker A (NS):** Hey! It’s been a while since we caught up. How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, long time no see. I am good, thank you. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. So, I've been thinking about cultural differences, especially in dining. Have you noticed anything interesting?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes! In Korea, we usually share food. Um, how to say... like big dish for everyone.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, like communal dining? That's fascinating. What about utensils? Do you use chopsticks all the time?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, mostly chopsticks and spoon. But, uh, no knife and fork like here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, that makes sense. Are there any dining manners I should know if I visit Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes, maybe. You should wait for elder to start eating first. It is polite.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. How about the way food is served? Is there anything special?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. We have many side... side dishes. It’s called banchan. They are... for everyone to share.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Do you have a favorite banchan?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like kimchi. Very, um, spicy but very good. You try before?

**Speaker A (NS):** I have! Kimchi is really tasty. Do you think dining etiquette here is different?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hmm, yes. People have own plate. And no, um, sharing is less.

**Speaker A (NS):** True, individual servings are common here. What about tipping? Is that usual in Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, not usual. In Korea, tip is not... um, expected. Service charge is in bill.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's interesting. It simplifies things a bit. Anything else I should be aware of?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe... oh, when eating, do not make noise. It is rude, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good to know. I’ll keep that in mind. What do you find most surprising about dining here?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Surprise? Maybe... ah, salad first. In Korea, it is with meal, not before.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a neat difference. Thanks for sharing all this! Should we grab some food soon?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like that idea. Let’s plan for it soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Looking forward to it. Talk soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you soon! B
