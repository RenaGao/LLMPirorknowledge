peaker A (NS):** Hi Jisoo! We need to plan something special for Minji's birthday. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes! I think maybe, we can do... how to say... surprise party?

**Speaker A (NS):** A surprise party sounds great! Do you know where we could have it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, maybe... at cafe? Minji like coffee very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** A caf√© is perfect! Do you have a specific one in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** There is, um, nice place near Han River. It is cozy and quiet.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely. Do you think we should invite a lot of people, or keep it small?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think small is better. Minji like small group, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, she does. How about the decorations? Should we bring some?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we can bring... how to say... balloons and banner?

**Speaker A (NS):** Balloons and a banner are perfect! What about food and drinks?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We can order cake from Minji's favorite bakery. Um, also coffee, since it's cafe.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! What time should we get there to set everything up?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe one hour early? So, we have time to prepare.

**Speaker A (NS):** One hour early sounds good. Should we have a gift for her from everyone?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think we can collect money and buy... um, joint gift?

**Speaker A (NS):** A group gift is thoughtful. Do you know what she might like?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Minji talk about new book she want. We can buy that?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, a book it is. How should we tell everyone about the plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I can make group chat message, and explain plan to everyone.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, let me know if you need help with the message. Anything else we should consider?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe music? Minji like soft music, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, soft music would be nice. Thanks, Jisoo! I think this will be a wonderful surprise for Minji.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! I hope Minji really like. Let's make her hap
