peaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! Are you ready for the exam this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, hello! I... I think not ready yet. It is difficult for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I understand. Which part do you find most challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I, uh, the writing part is very hard. I not... um, how to say... good with grammar.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Have you tried practicing with some sample essays?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, but still confuse. The sentences... they not clear for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe I can help. Do you want to go over some examples together?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes, please! That is very helpful for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's start with an introduction. How do you usually begin your essays?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I say, um, "This essay will talk about..." but it feel too simple.

**Speaker A (NS):** You can try starting with a question or a quote to make it more engaging.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, like a question? Okay, I will try that.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And how about the body paragraphs? Do you use transition words?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Transition... um, sometimes I forget them. It is difficult to remember.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's okay. Words like "firstly," "however," and "additionally" can help guide your reader.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. I will write them down. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! How about your conclusion? How do you end your essays?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I just, uh, say "In conclusion," and then finish quickly.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good start, but try to summarize your main points and offer a final thought.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Final thought... like, um, opinion or advice?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! It leaves a lasting impression on the reader.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I will practice more. Thank you for helping me with this.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Jisoo. Let's meet again if you need more help, alright?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. Thank you so much! See you lat
