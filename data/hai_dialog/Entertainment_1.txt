peaker A (NS):** Hi Nok, do you have any plans for Friday evening?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! Um, I not have plan yet. Why you ask?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could go out for dinner. Do you have any restaurant in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, yes! I think about Thai restaurant... um, the one with spicy food? How to say... famous for tom yum?

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you mean "Spicy Thai Kitchen"?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, Spicy Thai Kitchen! I hear it is very good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great choice. Do you want to book a table there? 

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, but I not know how. Can you help book?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can handle that. What time do you prefer?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, maybe seven o'clock? Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Seven is perfect. Would you like to do anything after dinner?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hmm, maybe we can go... how to say... see movie?

**Speaker A (NS):** Watch a movie? That sounds fun. Do you have a specific film in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I not sure. Maybe new action movie? Many people say good.

**Speaker A (NS):** There's a new action movie showing at the theater nearby. I can check the times.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, please. I like action movies. They are exciting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'll check and let you know. Should we meet at the restaurant or elsewhere?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think... um, meet restaurant is easier, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, meeting at the restaurant works. I'll send you the details once the booking is done.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you so much. I look forward to it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too, Nok. It'll be a fun evening!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you on Friday. Have a nice day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! See you so
