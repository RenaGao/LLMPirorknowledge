peaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek, can we talk about the project report?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Uh, yes, of course. Um, I want to say sorry. I make mistake in the report.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, Lek. What was the mistake about?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, the part about, um, the sales... in the second quarter.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, thanks for pointing that out. How do you plan to fix it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I, uh, I will check data again. Then I correct and send new report.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a good plan. Let me know if you need any help.
