peaker A (NS - Store Employee):** Welcome to our store! How can I assist you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai - Customer):** Um, yes. Hello. I have a question about, uh, return... how to say... return policy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! What would you like to know about our return policy?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I buy this shirt last week, and it is, um, too big. Can I, uh, bring back and get small size?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, you can exchange it for a smaller size. Do you have the receipt with you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I have here. But, um, shirt not have tag. Is that okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's okay. As long as you have the receipt and the shirt is in good condition, we can help you with the exchange.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, good. And, um, if I donâ€™t find size, can I, um, get money back?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, if we don't have the size you need, we can offer you a refund. You just need to show the receipt.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, thank you so much. And, um, how many days I have to return?

**Speaker A (NS):** You have 30 days from the date of purchase to return or exchange items.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, okay. So I have, um, three weeks more?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, you have about three weeks left. Is there anything else I can help you with?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, no, I think... no, wait! I have one more. If I need, um, not here, but online return?

**Speaker A (NS):** If you purchased online, you can return it by mail or bring it to any store location. We can help with either option.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, good. I think I bring here better. Easier for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's perfectly fine! We're here to help you with any returns or exchanges.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. You are very kind and make easy for me to understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! I'm glad to help. If you have more questions, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I will. Thank you again. I go look for, um, correct size now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let me know if you need any assistance while you shop.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure. Have a nice day!
