peaker A (NS):** Hi Lek! How's everything going?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! Everything good. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I was thinking, should we plan a group vacation soon?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! I like this idea. Um, we need to choose place, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Do you have any places in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hmm, maybe go to Chiang Mai. It is nice there, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Chiang Mai is beautiful! We could visit the temples and maybe a night market.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, night market good. And, uh, we can also go to... um, mountain? How to say...

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you mean Doi Suthep?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, Doi Suthep! We can see view from there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea. How many days should we plan for the trip?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe three day? Not too long, not too short.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. What about activities? Aside from sightseeing, what else should we do?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think we can, um, do cooking class. Thai food class is famous.

**Speaker A (NS):** A cooking class sounds fun! We could learn to make some local dishes.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, and then we eat what we cook. Very tasty!

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Do you know who else might be interested in joining us?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think maybe Nuch and Ploy want to come. I ask them.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, the more the merrier! Let's see if they're free.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I ask them today. And we can discuss more later.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. Let me know what they say. Looking forward to it!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, me too! Will be fun trip. Thank you for plan this.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Lek! Talk so
