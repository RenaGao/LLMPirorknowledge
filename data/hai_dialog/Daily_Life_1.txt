peaker A (NS):** Hi, Somchai! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I heard you’re planning a picnic this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that’s right. I want to go with my family. Um, how to say... together at the park.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! Which park do you have in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We think about Lumphini Park. It is, uh, big and have many space for children to play.

**Speaker A (NS):** Lumphini Park is a great choice. Have you decided what food to bring?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Not all. But maybe, um, some sandwich, fruit, and... how you say... sticky rice?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, sticky rice. That sounds delicious! Are you planning to bring any drinks?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we bring water and some juice. Uh, my children like orange juice a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice choice! How many people will be joining the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It will be five of us. Me, my wife, two children, and my mother.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a perfect family outing. What time do you plan to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We think about, um, 9:30 in morning. It is, uh, not too hot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! Morning is the best time. Do you plan any activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we have, um, a ball to play football and, uh, some books for read.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like fun! Do you need anything else prepared?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe just, um, a mat to sit. And, uh, sunscreen because it is sunny.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sunscreen is important, yes. I hope you all have a wonderful time!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you very much! I hope it is a, um, good day with family.

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm sure it will be. Enjoy your picnic, Somchai!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! Have a good weekend t
