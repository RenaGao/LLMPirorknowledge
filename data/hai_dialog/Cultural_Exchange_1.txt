peaker A (NS):** Hey, Lek! How’s it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi, Nuch! I’m good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m great too. I’ve been thinking about our conversation the other day about dining etiquette in different countries. It’s really interesting!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh yes, um, I remember we talk about that. Different country have, uh, different rules for eating.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Like in Thailand, we have our own way of showing respect at the table, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes! Like, uh, we not use chopsticks for rice, and we share food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, and in some Western countries, they usually have their own plates.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, and they use fork and knife more. Um, I sometimes confuse which one to use!

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand! It can be tricky. Do you find any other differences interesting?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hmm, how about... oh, yes! In Thailand, we not finish all food on plate. It show, um, we have enough.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right. In some places, finishing everything might show appreciation for the meal.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, yes. And also, um, we not speak loud at table. Quiet is polite, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, being quiet and respectful is important. What about drinking etiquette?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, um, we say "Chon!" when toast, like "Cheers." But, uh, we not drink too much.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true. Moderation is key. How do you feel about trying to adapt to different customs when traveling?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is, um, interesting but sometimes hard. I try to learn, but I worry make mistake.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s okay to make mistakes. People usually appreciate the effort. Do you have any memorable experiences?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! I remember in Japan, I, um, slurp noodle. People look, uh, surprised, but then they say it’s okay.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good one! Slurping is actually a compliment there. Any advice for others traveling abroad?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hmm, yes. Maybe, um, learn small thing about the culture before go. It help a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely a good tip. Thanks for sharing, Lek. It’s always fun to talk about these things with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, Nuch. I like talk with you, too. See you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you, Lek! Take ca
