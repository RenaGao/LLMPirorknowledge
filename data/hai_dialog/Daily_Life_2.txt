peaker A (NS):** Hi! I heard you wanted to cook something special today. Can you tell me what it is?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes! I want to make... um, how to say... green curry. It my favorite.

**Speaker A (NS):** Green curry sounds delicious! How do you usually prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** First, I need chicken. And also, green curry paste. You know this?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I know it! Do you make the paste yourself or buy it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I buy from, um, Asian store. It easy. If make, it take long time.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What do you do after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Then, um, I fry the paste in some oil. Make it, uh, smell good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great. Do you add any vegetables?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I add... um, eggplant and maybe bamboo shoot. And basil leaf, it important.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a lot of flavors! What about the coconut milk?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, after fry, I put coconut milk. Make it creamy, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, that makes it rich. How long do you cook everything?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Uh, maybe 15 minute? Until chicken is, um, how to say... cook all.

**Speaker A (NS):** Cooked through, right. And do you serve it with rice?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, with jasmine rice. It... um, very good smell.

**Speaker A (NS):** Jasmine rice complements it perfectly. Do you need any help with the cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, thank you! Maybe you can help with chopping vegetable?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I'd love to help. I can chop the eggplant for you.
