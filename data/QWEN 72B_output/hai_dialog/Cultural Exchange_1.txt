**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Nuch, how’s it going? I was thinking it might be fun to compare some dining etiquette between Thailand and the US.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi, um, I am good. Yes, that sound fun. What you want to know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, for example, in the US, it’s common to use a knife and fork. How is it in Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** In Thailand, we use fork and spoon. We not use knife so much. Spoon is main one.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting. And what about chopsticks? I know they are used in some Asian countries.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, chopstick use for noodle and some dish, but not all time. Mostly, we use spoon and fork.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. How about seating arrangements? Do you have any specific rules?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we have. In Thailand, um, how to say... elderly and guest sit in good place. Like, near the table or head of the table.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. In the US, it’s more casual, but we often have the host sit at the head of the table. What about eating with hands?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** In Thailand, we usually eat with spoon and fork, but sometimes with hand for some food, like street food or sticky rice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a cool tradition. In the US, we avoid eating with our hands for most dishes, except for things like burgers or pizza. How about pouring drinks for others?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we do that. It is polite to pour drink for other people, especially for elder or guest.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice custom. In the US, it’s considered polite to offer to pour drinks for others, but it’s not as common as in Thailand.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I see. Also, in Thailand, we not waste food. It is very important.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. In the US, we try to avoid waste too, but it’s not always a strict rule. Do you have any other etiquette rules you’d like to share?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes. We not talk about bad thing during meal. Like, politics or argue. It is not polite.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good rule. In the US, we also avoid those topics, but sometimes it happens. What do you think is the most important thing to remember when dining in Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, to be polite and respect others. And enjoy the food with them.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great point. It’s all about respect and enjoying the moment. Thanks for sharing all this, Nuch!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You welcome! I learn a lot too. See you soon, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Have a great day, Nuch! Bye!
