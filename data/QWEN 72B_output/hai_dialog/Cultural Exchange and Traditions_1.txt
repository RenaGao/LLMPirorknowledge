**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Nuch! It's great to catch up with you. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hey, I am good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. So, I was thinking, we could talk about dining etiquette. Have you noticed any differences between Thai and Western dining customs?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um... many difference. In Thailand, we share food together. In Western, each person have separate plate.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right. Sharing food is a big part of Thai culture. Do you find it different when you eat in Western restaurants?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it is different. In Thailand, we use spoon and fork. But, in Western, they use knife and fork.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good point. In Thailand, the spoon is the main eating utensil, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, spoon is main. Fork help to push food to spoon. But, in Western, fork is main.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. And what about the order of courses? In Western dining, there's usually an appetizer, main course, and dessert.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** In Thailand, we eat all dish together. Not separate course. We mix different flavor in one meal.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting. In Western dining, the order of courses helps to pace the meal. How do you feel about that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like it, but sometimes, I miss mix all food together. It is fun to mix flavor.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can totally understand that. Another difference is the role of the host. In Western culture, the host often pays for the meal. How is it in Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** In Thailand, we often pay together. If one person pay, it is very generous. But, usually, we share cost.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Sharing the cost is more common in Thailand. What about tipping? Is it a common practice in Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, tipping, but not as much as Western. In some restaurant, we give small tip. But, it is not necessary always.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to know. Tipping can vary a lot from place to place. It’s always good to be aware of local customs.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it is good. Thank you for talk about this. It is very interesting.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad you found it interesting. It’s always fun to learn about different cultures. We should try a Thai restaurant sometime soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is good idea. Sounds fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s plan it for next week. See you then!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** See you next week! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Nuch! Take care!
