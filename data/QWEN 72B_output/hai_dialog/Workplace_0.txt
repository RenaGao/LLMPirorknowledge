**Scene: A project deadline discussion between a native English speaker (NS) and a Thai speaker (L2, Thai).**

**Speaker A (NS):** Good morning, Nuch! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Good morning! I am good, thank you. How to say... um, how are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! We need to talk about the project deadline. Can you tell me where you are with it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think I almost finish. But some part still need more time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, can you specify which parts need more time?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** The part for... um, how to say... data entry and the report, they are not complete yet.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. The data entry and the report. Can you estimate how much more time you need for those?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I need, um, maybe two or three days more. Is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. The current deadline is next Friday. Do you think you can meet that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I try my best. I think it is possible, but I need work extra hours.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good effort. How about if we extend the deadline to the following Monday? Would that help?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it is very good. I can finish on Monday for sure.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Just to confirm, you’ll have the data entry and the report done by Monday?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will finish it. No problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Also, do you need any additional resources or support to complete the project?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think I am okay. But if I have problem, I will, how to say... ask for help?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Can you send me an update by the end of today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will send update. No problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you, Nuch. You’re doing a great job. Is there anything else you want to discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I think this is all. Thank you very much for understanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. Have a good day, and see you Monday!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Goodbye, and see you on Monday.
