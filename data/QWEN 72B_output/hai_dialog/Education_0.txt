**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Nuch! How are you doing? Are you free to talk for a bit?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, hi! I am fine, thank you. I have time. What do you want to talk about?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I wanted to discuss the upcoming exam. Have you started preparing yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I start. But I have problem with some part. It is difficult.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I know what you mean. Which parts are you finding hard?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, the... how to say... the section about... um, the ecosystem. It is very complex.

**Speaker A (NS):** The ecosystem section can be tricky. Do you have any specific questions about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I do not understand how to... um... how to identify the primary producer in the food chain.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. The primary producers are usually plants. They make their own food through photosynthesis.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Plants, yes. I get it now. But how we know which plant is primary producer?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. Look for plants that can perform photosynthesis, like trees, grass, or algae. They convert sunlight into energy.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I see. It makes sense. Thank you. How about you? You understand everything in the ecosystem section?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think I’m pretty good with it, but I’m still reviewing. We could study together if you’d like.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That sounds great! When can we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this weekend? We can meet at the library on Saturday morning.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Saturday morning? Yes, that is good. What time?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 10 o'clock? We can start early and have plenty of time.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ten o'clock is fine. I will bring my notes and books.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll bring some practice questions too. See you then!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** See you Saturday! Thank you for helping me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Have a good day, Nuch!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Bye!
