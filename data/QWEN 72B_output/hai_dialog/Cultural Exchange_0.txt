**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi, I am good. Thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. Can you tell me about a tradition or festival from Thailand?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure, um... one of the most famous festival in Thailand is Songkran. It is Thai New Year.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I've heard of Songkran! When does it happen?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It happen in April. Usually, um, 13th to 15th of April.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right! What do people usually do during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** People celebrate by, um, throwing water at each other. It is fun. We also, um, clean house and, uh, visit temple.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! Why do people throw water at each other?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Water is for, um, washing away bad thing from last year. It is like, um, fresh start.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a beautiful idea. Are there any special foods or traditions during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we eat, um, special food like, um, mango sticky rice. And, uh, we have parade and, um, music.

**Speaker A (NS):** Mango sticky rice sounds delicious! Do you have any favorite memories from Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um, I remember one time, my family and I go to, um, um, Chiang Mai. It is very, very fun. Everyone join in, um, water fight.

**Speaker A (NS):** That must have been amazing! Is there anything else you want to add about Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes. Songkran is, uh, important for family and, um, community to come together. It is, um, very special time.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a wonderful celebration. Thank you for sharing that with me, Nuch!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You are welcome. I happy to tell you about Songkran.

**Speaker A (NS):** It was great learning about it. I hope we can celebrate it together someday! Have a great day, Nuch!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
