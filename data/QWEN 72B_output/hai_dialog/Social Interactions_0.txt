**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I'm Emily. What’s your name?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! My name is Nuch. Nice to meet you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you too, Nuch! Where are you from?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I from Bangkok, Thailand. It is very... how to say... lively city.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great word! Bangkok is indeed very lively. What brought you to this party?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** My friend, Lek, invite me. He say it is good party.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s nice of Lek! Have you been to many parties here?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Not many. I usually... um, stay at home. But I like to meet new people.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great attitude! What do you like to do in your free time?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like to read book, watch movie, and cook. Cooking is fun, you know.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! What’s your favorite dish to cook?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** My favorite is... um, green curry. It is very... how to say... spicy and delicious.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds amazing! I love Thai food. Have you tried any local dishes here?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I try pizza and hamburger. They are good, but not like Thai food.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Thai food is definitely unique. Do you have any hobbies besides cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like to draw and paint. I think it is very creative and relaxing.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful! Do you have any pieces you’re particularly proud of?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I have one painting of... um, sunset on the beach. It is very... how to say... peaceful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds beautiful! Maybe you can show me some of your work sometime.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure! I will bring some pictures next time we meet.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! It was great chatting with you, Nuch. Have a good time at the party!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, Emily. You too. See you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later, Nuch! Take care.
