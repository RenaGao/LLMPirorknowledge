**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Nuch, how’s everything going?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi, um, I am good. Thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I heard you’ve been a bit under the weather. How are you feeling now?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I am better now. But, um, still a little... how to say... tired?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s tough when you’re not feeling 100%. Have you been taking care of yourself?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I try. I drink water a lot and, um, I eat... what is it... healthy food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Eating well and staying hydrated are really important. Have you been getting enough rest too?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I try to sleep more, but sometimes it is hard. I have much work.

**Speaker A (NS):** I get that. Work can be really demanding. Maybe you could try setting a regular sleep schedule. That can help a lot.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I will try. And, um, what about exercise? I think I need to start doing more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Exercise is a fantastic way to boost your energy and mood. Even a short walk every day can make a big difference.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I want to go jogging. But, um, I don’t know where to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** You could start by finding a local park or a safe route in your neighborhood. Start with short distances and gradually build up. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That sound good. Um, how to say... a little scared about going alone.

**Speaker A (NS):** I totally understand. You could try going with a friend or joining a group. Some parks have community fitness classes too.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, maybe I ask Lek to go with me. He like exercise.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! Having a workout buddy can make it more fun and motivating.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** And, um, I think I need to, how to say... relax more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Relaxation is crucial. You could try meditation or yoga. They’re great for reducing stress.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I heard about it. I will, um, try yoga. Thank you for advice.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Nuch! I’m happy to help. Remember, taking small steps consistently is key. How about we meet for a yoga session next weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that would be nice. Um, what time you want to meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 9 a.m. on Saturday? That’s usually a good time for me.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I can do that. See you Saturday morning!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! See you then. Take care, Nuch!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. Take care! Bye!
