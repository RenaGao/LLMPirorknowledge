**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Welcome to our store. Can I help you find something today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, hello. Yes, I need help. I want to find... um, something to fix my wall.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. Are you looking for something specific, like a nail or a screw?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think I need a... how to say... thing for hanging pictures?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, you're looking for picture hanging strips. They're great for hanging pictures without damaging the wall. 

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that’s right! Picture hanging strips. Where can I find them?

**Speaker A (NS):** They're in the home improvement section. It’s just down this aisle, to your right. 

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ok, thank you. How... how to say... how many do I need for big picture?

**Speaker A (NS):** For a big picture, you might need a couple of strips to ensure it’s securely hung. Each pack usually comes with a few strips.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I see. And... um, do you have something to measure the wall?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we have measuring tapes in the same section. They’re very handy for making sure everything is level and straight.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Great. And... how to say... glue for small things, like decorations?

**Speaker A (NS):** For small decorations, you might want to use a craft glue or adhesive dots. They’re also in the same section.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes. Adhesive dots. That’s what I need. Thank you so much for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! If you need any more help, feel free to ask. 

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I will. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Have a great day!
