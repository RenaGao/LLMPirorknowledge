**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Nuch! It's great to see you. How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I heard you have some great ideas for a cultural event. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes, I want to organize a Thai food festival. We can share our traditional food and culture with everyone.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fantastic! What kind of food are you thinking of serving?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We can have pad thai, green curry, and som tum. Also, we can have dessert like mango sticky rice. People love it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those all sound delicious! Do you have any other activities in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we can have Thai dance performance. And also, we can teach people how to make some simple Thai dishes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! Will there be any traditional games as well?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, how to say... yes, we can have games like tuk tuk. It is fun and easy to play.

**Speaker A (NS):** Tuk tuk sounds interesting! How is it played?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is a game where we use a small ball and try to hit it with a stick. The one who hits it farthest win.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. That sounds like a lot of fun. When and where do you plan to hold this event?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We can have it at the community center next month. Maybe on a Saturday?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. Do you need any help with the planning?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that would be very nice. Thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I’d be happy to help. How about we meet next week to go over the details?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That is good. Next Wednesday, is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, Wednesday works for me. What time?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Let’s say 2:00 p.m.?

**Speaker A (NS):** 2:00 p.m. it is. I’ll see you then. Thanks again for the invite!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! See you Wednesday. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Nuch! Talk to you soon!
