**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Nuch! I’m glad you’re here. How about we start by getting to know each other a bit? Can you tell me what your favorite meal is and how you prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! Um, my favorite meal... is green curry. It is very delicious. I like to prepare it, but it is a little... how to say... complicated.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s okay! It can be a bit tricky, but I’d love to hear about it. What ingredients do you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I need chicken, coconut milk, green curry paste, vegetables like bamboo shoot and eggplant, Thai basil, and fish sauce.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds great! Do you have a specific way you like to cook it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I... um, first, I put coconut milk in pan and heat it. Then I add green curry paste and stir until is mix well.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. What’s the next step?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Next, I add chicken and cook until is... um... not pink. Then I add vegetables and stir for a few minutes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. How long do you usually cook the vegetables?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I usually cook them until they are soft, but not too soft. Maybe five minutes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And what about the Thai basil and fish sauce?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I add Thai basil at the end and fish sauce for taste. I stir for one more minute and then it is ready to eat.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds really yummy! Do you have any special tips to make it even better?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um... I think you should... how to say... taste and adjust the seasoning. Sometimes need more fish sauce or sugar.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great tip. Can you help me make it one day?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure! I would be happy to cook with you. It is fun, and you can learn.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love that! How about this weekend? Are you free?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I am free. What day is good for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about Saturday afternoon?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Saturday afternoon is good. We can start around two o’clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Two o’clock sounds perfect. I’ll buy the ingredients tomorrow.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Great! I will help you when we cook.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome, thanks Nuch! I’m really looking forward to it. See you Saturday at two!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** See you Saturday at two! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Nuch! Have a good day!
