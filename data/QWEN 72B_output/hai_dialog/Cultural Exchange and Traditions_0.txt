**Scene: Nuch and Lek are discussing a traditional Thai festival, Loy Krathong, with a native English speaker, Alex.**

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** Hi Nuch, hi Lek! How are you both doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Nuch):** Hi Alex, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** I'm doing well, thanks. Lek, how about you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Lek):** I am good too. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** Great to hear! Nuch, I’ve always been fascinated by Thai festivals. Can you tell me more about Loy Krathong?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Nuch):** Sure, I love Loy Krathong. It is... um, how to say... very beautiful festival. We celebrate it every year in November.

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** November, right. What do people do during the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Nuch):** People make krathongs, which is a... um... small basket made from banana leaves. We put flower, candle, and incense in it.

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** That sounds lovely. Do you have to buy these krathongs, or do you make them yourself?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Nuch):** Most people make them by hand, but you can buy them too. After, we go to river or lake and float krathongs.

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** Why do you float them?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Nuch):** We float krathongs to pay respect to the water spirits and to ask for forgiveness. Also, it is way to get rid of bad luck.

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** That’s really interesting. Lek, have you made a krathong before?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Lek):** Yes, I have. My family and I make krathongs together. It is fun and happy time.

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** That sounds like a wonderful family tradition. Are there any special foods you eat during Loy Krathong?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Nuch):** Yes, we eat many traditional Thai foods. For example, tom yum soup and mango sticky rice. And we also have sweets like kanom krok.

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** Yum, all that sounds delicious! Is there anything else you want to share about Loy Krathong?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Lek):** Yes, there are often fireworks and light shows. It is very pretty and everyone feels happy.

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** It sounds magical! Thanks so much for telling me about it. Nuch, Lek, it was great talking to you both.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Nuch):** No problem! Thank you for asking. We enjoy telling about our culture.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai, Lek):** Yes, thank you. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker A (NS, Alex):** Goodbye, Nuch and Lek. Take care!
