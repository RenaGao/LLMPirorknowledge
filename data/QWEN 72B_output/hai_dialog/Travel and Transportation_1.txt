**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Could you help me, please? I'm a bit lost.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, of course! What you need?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m trying to find the Royal Garden Hotel. Could you tell me how to get there from here?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, Royal Garden Hotel. It is not far. Um, how to say... You go straight this road, and then you turn right at third street.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so I go straight and then turn right at the third street. Got it. Is it far from there?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Not really. It is only... maybe five minute walk. You will see big sign say "Royal Garden Hotel."

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, that sounds easy enough. Are there any landmarks I should look out for along the way?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, you pass small market. It is red building. After market, you turn right, and hotel is on left side.

**Speaker A (NS):** So, I’ll look for the red market building and then turn right after that. Got it. Thank you so much!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You welcome. Um, do you need anything else?

**Speaker A (NS):** No, I think I’ve got everything I need. By the way, is the area around the hotel safe at night?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it is safe. There are many street lights and people walk there even late.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to know. Thanks again for your help. It’s really appreciated.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No problem. I hope you enjoy your stay. If you need help again, just ask someone. They are friendly here.

**Speaker A (NS):** I will. Thank you. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
