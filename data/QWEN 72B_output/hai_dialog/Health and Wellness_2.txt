**Scene: A fitness trainer and a client, Nuch, are discussing exercise routines and fitness goals.**

**Speaker A (NS, Trainer):** Hi Nuch, it’s great to see you today! How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Nuch):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS, Trainer):** I’m doing well, thanks! So, what are your fitness goals right now?

**Speaker B (L2, Nuch):** My goal is to... um, lose some weight and get more fit. I want to feel healthy and strong.

**Speaker A (NS, Trainer):** That’s a great goal! What kind of exercises do you enjoy doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Nuch):** I like to run and do some... um, yoga. But I also want to try new things. How to say... strength training?

**Speaker A (NS, Trainer):** Yes, strength training can be really beneficial. It helps build muscle and improve your overall fitness. How often do you exercise now?

**Speaker B (L2, Nuch):** I go to gym... um, two time per week. Sometimes I run in the park on Saturday.

**Speaker A (NS, Trainer):** That’s a good start! Let’s aim to increase that to three or four times a week. We can mix in some strength training and maybe some interval training to boost your metabolism.

**Speaker B (L2, Nuch):** Okay, I can try. What is interval training?

**Speaker A (NS, Trainer):** Interval training involves alternating between short bursts of high-intensity exercise and periods of rest or lower-intensity exercise. It’s very effective for burning calories and improving endurance.

**Speaker B (L2, Nuch):** Ah, I see. That sounds challenging but good. Can we start with that next week?

**Speaker A (NS, Trainer):** Absolutely! We can start with a basic routine and gradually build up. What days work best for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Nuch):** How about... Tuesday and Thursday? And maybe Saturday?

**Speaker A (NS, Trainer):** Perfect! Let’s plan for Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM, and Saturday at 9 AM. Does that sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Nuch):** Yes, that sound good to me. I will try my best.

**Speaker A (NS, Trainer):** Great! I’m really excited to work with you. Let’s also track your progress with some measurements and photos if you’re comfortable with that.

**Speaker B (L2, Nuch):** Sure, I want to see my progress. Thank you so much for help.

**Speaker A (NS, Trainer):** Of course! I’ll see you on Tuesday. Take care!

**Speaker B (L2, Nuch):** See you Tuesday. Bye!
