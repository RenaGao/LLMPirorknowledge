**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Lek! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I heard you're having some trouble with your internet service. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um... my internet very slow. It is very slow when I try to... uh, watch movie or do work.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. That can be really frustrating. Have you checked if it's a problem with your device?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I check my router and my computer. Both are okay. I think it is problem with the service.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, that makes sense. Have you contacted your service provider yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Not yet. I don’t know what to say. How to contact them?

**Speaker A (NS):** You can call their customer service number. It’s usually on the back of your bill or their website. Have you tried looking there?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I look, but I not sure what to say. They speak fast English.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Here’s a simple way to explain your issue: "Hi, my internet connection is very slow. I need help to fix it." Does that help?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is helpful. I will say, "Hi, my internet connection is very slow. I need help to fix it."

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Also, you can ask them to check your internet speed and see if there are any issues on their end.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, and how to say that part?

**Speaker A (NS):** You can say, "Can you check my internet speed and see if there are any issues on your end?" That should cover everything.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I will try that. I hope they can fix it soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure they will. If you need any more help, feel free to reach out. Take care!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you so much! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Lek! Hope it all works out.
