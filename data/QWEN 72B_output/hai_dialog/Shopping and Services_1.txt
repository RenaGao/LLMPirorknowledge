**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Nuch! I was thinking about buying a new camera. Do you want to help me pick one out?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes, of course! I like cameras. What kind you want? For photo or video?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m thinking of something that can do both, but I mostly want it for photos. Any recommendations?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I think mirrorless camera good. It have many feature and not too heavy. You can try Sony or Canon.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good point. What about battery life? I don’t want to run out of power during a long day of shooting.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, battery life important. Sony have good battery, but Canon also good. Maybe check review online first?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. What about the lens options? Are they easy to find and change?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sony and Canon have many lens. You can find different type, like wide angle or telephoto. It depend what you like to shoot.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s helpful. What about the price range? I don’t want to break the bank.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Price also important. Sony sometimes expensive, but Canon have good price. You can find good deal if you wait for sale.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What about user-friendly features? I’m not a professional, so I need something that’s easy to use.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Both brand have good interface. Maybe try both in store first? You can see which one feel better for you.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. I’ll check them out in person. Thanks for your help, Nuch!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You welcome! I hope you find good camera. Um, if you have question, you can ask me again.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! I appreciate it. Let’s catch up after I get the camera and see how it goes.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** sounds good! I wait to hear from you. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, Nuch. Bye!
