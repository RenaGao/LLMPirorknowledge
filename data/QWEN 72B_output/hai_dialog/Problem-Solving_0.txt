**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Nuch! How are you? I wanted to talk to you about something that happened last weekend.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, hi! I fine. What is it about last weekend?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s about our plans to meet at the park. I was there at 8:30, but you didn’t show up. I was a bit worried.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, I sorry. I know I miss. I have big problem with my schedule.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, but I just wanted to make sure you were okay. What happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, I have family... thing. My cousin, he very sick. I must take care of him.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. I hope your cousin is feeling better now. That must have been really tough.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, thank you. He is better now. I should tell you early, but I forget.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s okay, Nuch. I understand. Next time, just let me know if something comes up, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure, I will. I sorry again. Can we still meet this weekend?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I’d love to. What do you want to do?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, how about we go to that new coffee shop? I hear they have good dessert.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! I’ve been wanting to check it out. What time works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** How about... 10 o’clock? I think it not too early.
