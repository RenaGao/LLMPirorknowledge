**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How are you today? I’m here to have a look at your beautiful handcrafted bags.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello, I am good. Thank you for come. These bags all make by me. You like which one?

**Speaker A (NS):** They’re all so beautiful, but I think I’ll go with the blue one. It’s really eye-catching. How much is it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** This one, um, 500 baht. But, you like it, I can give you... um, special price. 450 baht.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good price, but I was hoping for a bit less. Could you do 400 baht?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Uh, 400 baht is little bit low. But, okay, I can do 420 baht. This really good price, I promise.

**Speaker A (NS):** 420 baht? That’s a fair price. I’ll take it. It’s a great deal. Thank you!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You welcome. I happy you like it. Um, you want any other thing? I have many more craft.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very kind of you. I’ll take a look, but I think I’m set for now. Thanks for the great service.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No problem. If you come back, I give you more good price. Hope you have good day.

**Speaker A (NS):** I will definitely come back. Have a great day! Thank you again.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You welcome. Goodbye, see you soon!
