**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I'm Alex. Nice to meet you. What's your name?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi, I am Nuch. Nice to meet you, Alex. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm good, thanks! How about you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I am good, thank you. Um, how to say... What do you like to do in your free time?

**Speaker A (NS):** I enjoy hiking and reading. What about you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I... I like to go to the park and... um... play with my dog. And I like to cook traditional Thai food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really fun! What’s your favorite Thai dish to cook?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** My favorite is Pad Thai. It is... um... how to say... very tasty. And I like to make green curry too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Both sound delicious! I’ve tried Pad Thai before, and it was amazing. Do you have any other hobbies?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like to... um... draw. I draw pictures of... um... nature and animals.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really cool! Have you ever thought about taking your drawings to an art show?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, not yet. But I want to try sometime. How about you? Do you have any other hobbies besides hiking and reading?

**Speaker A (NS):** I also enjoy photography. I love capturing nature and cityscapes. Have you ever tried photography?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I have not. But I think it is... um... interesting. I want to learn how to take good pictures.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s a lot of fun. Maybe we can go on a photo walk together sometime!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that would be... um... very nice. When can we do that?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about next weekend? We can check out some local parks and take some photos.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That sounds good. I am free... um... on Saturday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! How about we meet at 10 a.m. at the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** 10 a.m. is... um... good. I will be there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll bring my camera, and we can share some tips. Looking forward to it!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, me too. Thank you, Alex. See you Saturday.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a great day, Nuch!
