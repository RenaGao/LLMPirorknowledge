**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! How are you feeling today?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi, I… um, not so good. I have some problem with my health.

**Speaker A:** I see. Can you tell me more about what’s going on?

**Speaker B:** Yes. I… um, I feel very tired. And my head, it hurts a lot.

**Speaker A:** Okay, let’s start with the headache. When did it start?

**Speaker B:** It start… um, maybe two days ago. It’s getting worse.

**Speaker A:** I see. Do you have any other symptoms? Like a fever or a cough?

**Speaker B:** No, I don’t think… um, I don’t have fever. But my throat, it feels sore.

**Speaker A:** That’s helpful. Have you had any trouble sleeping or eating?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I have trouble sleep. And I don’t feel hungry. I only drink water.

**Speaker A:** I understand. How about your energy levels? Are you feeling more tired than usual?

**Speaker B:** Yes, very tired. I can’t do… um, my work or… um, anything.

**Speaker A:** I see. It sounds like you’re really not feeling well. Have you taken any medicine?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I take some… um, headache… headache medicine. But it doesn’t help much.

**Speaker A:** I see. Let’s do a quick physical exam to check things out. We’ll also run some tests to understand what’s going on.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you. I… um, I hope it’s nothing serious.

**Speaker A:** I understand your concern. We’ll get to the bottom of it. How about we start with a blood test and some basic checks?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that’s fine. I’ll do… um, what you say.

**Speaker A:** Great. I’ll have the nurse take you to the lab. We’ll get the results as soon as possible.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, doctor. I feel better knowing… um, you’ll help me.

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome, Xiao Li. Take care and we’ll talk again soon. Goodbye!

**Speaker B:** Goodbye, doctor. See you later.
