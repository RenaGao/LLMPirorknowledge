**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! I saw the beautiful handmade scarf you have. Can you tell me a bit more about it?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Ah, sure! This scarf made from silk. It is very soft and... um... colorful. My grandmother... she make it.

**Speaker A:** That’s amazing! It’s really beautiful. How much is it?

**Speaker B:** It is... um... 50 dollars.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that’s a bit more than I was expecting. Is there any room for negotiation?

**Speaker B:** Um... yes, I can... maybe... 45 dollars?

**Speaker A:** That’s still a bit high for me. Could you go to 40 dollars?

**Speaker B:** Hmm... let me think. Um... okay, 40 dollars. But this is... um... lowest price.

**Speaker A:** I appreciate that. It’s a really special scarf. Can you tell me more about the patterns on it?

**Speaker B:** Sure! These patterns... they represent... um... good luck and prosperity. My grandmother... she very good at designing them.

**Speaker A:** That’s really interesting. I love the story behind it. I’ll take it then.

**Speaker B:** Great! I am happy you like it. You want a bag for it?

**Speaker A:** Yes, please. Thank you so much!

**Speaker B:** No problem! Here you go. I hope you enjoy it.

**Speaker A:** I’m sure I will. Thank you again. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** You too! Goodbye!
