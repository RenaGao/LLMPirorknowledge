**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey Xiao Li! How are you? I heard you have some interesting festivals in China. Could you tell me about one?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi, Xiao Ming! I am fine, thank you. Yes, of course! Um, one festival that is very important to me is... how to say... Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year.

**Speaker A:** Oh, Chinese New Year! I’ve heard about it. What makes it special?

**Speaker B:** It is special because it is big family reunion time. Everyone try to go home and be with family. We have big dinner, um, with lots of food, and um, special dishes.

**Speaker A:** That sounds wonderful! What kind of food do you usually eat?

**Speaker B:** We eat, um, dumplings, fish, and um, niangao, which is sticky rice cake. Fish is very important because it means "surplus" in Chinese, so we hope for good fortune in the new year.

**Speaker A:** That’s really interesting! What about activities? Do you do anything special during the festival?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we have, um, um, how to say... red envelope, give money to children for good luck. And we set off firecrackers, watch dragon and lion dances. Also, we, um, clean the house before the new year to, um, sweep away bad luck.

**Speaker A:** Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! Do you have a favorite part of the festival?

**Speaker B:** My favorite part is, um, family time. I love being with my family, eating delicious food, and watching the fireworks. It is very, very happy time.

**Speaker A:** It definitely sounds like a wonderful time! Do you have any special traditions you follow at home?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we, um, decorate our house with, um, red decorations, put up, um, couplets, and, um, lanterns. And we, um, visit relatives and friends to wish them a happy new year.

**Speaker A:** That’s great! It’s so nice to see how traditions bring people together. Thanks for sharing all this with me, Xiao Li!

**Speaker B:** You are welcome! I am happy to share. Maybe one day you can come to China and experience it yourself!

**Speaker A:** I would love that! It’s been really interesting learning about Chinese New Year. Thanks again, Xiao Li!

**Speaker B:** No problem! Talk to you soon, Xiao Ming! Bye!

**Speaker A:** Bye, Xiao Li! Take care!
