**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey Xiao Li! How was your trip to New York last week?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Oh, hi Xiao Ming! It was very good! I, um, I go there with my family. New York, it is very big city, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can imagine. What did you do there?

**Speaker B:** We, um, we visit many places. We, we go to Statue of Liberty, and uh, Central Park. Also, we, uh, go to Times Square. It is very, very crowded!

**Speaker A:** Wow, that sounds amazing! What was your favorite part of the trip?

**Speaker B:** My favorite part, um, how to say... it is, I think, the food. New York has very good food. We eat many kinds of food, like pizza, um, and bagels. And also, we try Chinese food in Chinatown.

**Speaker A:** That's great! Did you try any new dishes?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we try, um, what is it called... dim sum. It is very tasty. And uh, we also try, um, ah, cheesecake. It is very delicious!

**Speaker A:** Sounds delicious! Did you do anything else fun?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we, we go to, um, a museum. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is very big, and we see many paintings and old things.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome! Did you buy any souvenirs?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we buy some, um, small things for my friends. Also, I buy a, um, T-shirt with New York logo. It is very nice.

**Speaker A:** That's really thoughtful! How was the weather there?

**Speaker B:** The weather, it is, um, a little cold, but sunny. We, we wear jackets, but it is comfortable to walk around.

**Speaker A:** That's good to hear. Did you face any challenges during the trip?

**Speaker B:** Um, yes, sometimes we get lost, but we, we use map on phone, and it help us find way back. Also, the subway is very, very busy.

**Speaker A:** It can be overwhelming, but it's a great way to see the city. Did you take a lot of pictures?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we take many pictures. I, I want to show them to my friends and family. It is, um, very good memory.

**Speaker A:** I bet! It sounds like you had a fantastic trip. We should plan a trip together sometime!

**Speaker B:** Yes, that would be great! We can go to another city, um, maybe San Francisco or, um, Los Angeles.

**Speaker A:** Sounds like a plan! We'll definitely talk more about it. Have a good day, Xiao Li!

**Speaker B:** Thanks, you too! Goodbye, Xiao Ming!
