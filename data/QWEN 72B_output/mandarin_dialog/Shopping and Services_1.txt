**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! I am fine, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A:** I'm doing well, thanks! So, what are you looking to buy today?

**Speaker B:** I need to buy new phone. My old one... um... broken.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, that's a pain. What kind of phone are you thinking about getting?

**Speaker B:** I want smart phone. Um... with good camera and big screen.

**Speaker A:** Those are great features to look for. Any specific brand in mind?

**Speaker B:** I like Apple, but... um... too expensive. Maybe Samsung or Xiaomi?

**Speaker A:** Both are good choices. What about battery life? That’s important too.

**Speaker B:** Yes, battery life is important. I don’t want to charge it every day.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. What about the price range? Do you have a budget in mind?

**Speaker B:** I want to spend... um... how to say... less than 500 dollars.

**Speaker A:** That’s a reasonable budget. Have you checked out any models online?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I look at some models. But I not sure which one is best.

**Speaker A:** It can be overwhelming. What about storage? Do you need a lot of space for photos and apps?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I need big storage. Maybe 128 GB?

**Speaker A:** 128 GB is a good choice. What about other features like water resistance or facial recognition?

**Speaker B:** Water resistance is good, and facial recognition... um... make it easy to unlock.

**Speaker A:** Those are definitely useful features. Have you thought about getting a protective case?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I need protective case. Phone is important, I don’t want it to break.

**Speaker A:** Smart thinking! It’s always a good idea to protect your investment. So, are you ready to make a decision?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I think I will go with Samsung. It has everything I need.

**Speaker A:** Great choice! I hope you enjoy your new phone. Let me know how it works out for you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you! I will. Have a good day!
