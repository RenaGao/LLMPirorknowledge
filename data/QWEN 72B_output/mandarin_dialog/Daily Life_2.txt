**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! It's great to meet you. How are you settling in?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. It is nice to meet you. How are you?

**Speaker A:** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I heard you're from China. What's your favorite meal? Maybe we can cook it together sometime?

**Speaker B:** Oh, my favorite meal is Kung Pao chicken. It is very yummy. I can show you how to make it.

**Speaker A:** That sounds fantastic! What do we need to prepare?

**Speaker B:** Um, we need chicken, of course. And also, peanuts, and vegetables like bell peppers and onions. We also need, um, chili peppers for the spicy part.

**Speaker A:** Got it. What about the sauce? Do you have a special recipe?

**Speaker B:** Yes, the sauce is important. We need soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and a little bit of, um, how to say... starch? Yes, starch to make it thick.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. And what’s the cooking process like?

**Speaker B:** First, we cut the chicken into small pieces and marinate it with soy sauce and a little bit of wine. Then, we fry the peanuts and set them aside. Next, we, um... stir-fry the chicken with the vegetables and chili peppers. Finally, we add the sauce and mix everything together.

**Speaker A:** That sounds really easy to follow. How long does it take to cook everything?

**Speaker B:** It is not too long. Maybe 20 or 30 minutes. The most important part is to stir-fry quickly over high heat.

**Speaker A:** High heat, got it. And what about serving? Any special ways to serve it?

**Speaker B:** We can serve it with rice. Some people like to add a bit of, um, green onion on top for flavor.

**Speaker A:** That sounds delicious! I’m excited to try it. When do you want to cook it?

**Speaker B:** How about this Saturday? We can buy the ingredients together.

**Speaker A:** Perfect! I’m free this Saturday. Let’s do it.

**Speaker B:** Great! See you on Saturday. It will be fun.

**Speaker A:** Definitely! See you then. Have a good day!

**Speaker B:** You too! Bye!
