**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Xiao Li! Thanks for meeting up today. I wanted to talk about what happened at the party last weekend.

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Hey, Xiao Ming. Sure, what do you want to talk about?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I felt a bit left out when you and Xiao Wang were talking about the project and didn’t include me. Did you notice that?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Oh, I see. Um, I am sorry. I not mean to... exclude you. We just talking about the project, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand, but it felt like you guys were keeping me out of the loop. I was a bit hurt.

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** I really sorry. I did not mean to hurt you. We just excited about the project. I will make sure to include you next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great. I just want us to be able to communicate better and not have any misunderstandings in the future.

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, yes. I agree. We can talk more about our projects and make sure everyone feels included. How to say... let’s be more open?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Being more open and inclusive will make our group stronger. So, do you have any plans for this weekend?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Actually, I thinking about going to the park. The weather is nice, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great idea! What do you want to do at the park?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** We can ride bikes or have a picnic. Maybe bring some snacks and just enjoy the day.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect! Where can we rent the bikes?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** There is a place near the park entrance. I went there last time, it’s easy to find.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** How about 10 a.m.?

**Speaker A (NS):** 10 a.m. works for me. I’ll see you then!

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** No problem! See you then. Good talk, Xiao Ming.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good talk, Xiao Li. Have a great weekend!
