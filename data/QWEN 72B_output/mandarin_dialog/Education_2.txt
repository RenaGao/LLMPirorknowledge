**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! How’s it going?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi, um, I am good. How are you?

**Speaker A:** I’m doing well, thanks! Did you have any questions about the homework assignment we got today?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I have one question. Um, the homework, I not understand it very well. Can you explain, please?

**Speaker A:** Of course! What part of the assignment are you having trouble with?

**Speaker B:** The instructions, um... they say to write an essay about family traditions. But, I not sure what kind of thing to write.

**Speaker A:** Sure, I can help with that. The essay should focus on a tradition that’s important in your family. For example, maybe you have a special holiday you celebrate or a weekly dinner you have with your family.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I see. So, I can write about, um... how we celebrate Chinese New Year with my family?

**Speaker A:** Exactly! That sounds like a great topic. What do you usually do during Chinese New Year?

**Speaker B:** We, um, have a big dinner. We eat dumplings and, um, we watch the New Year’s show on TV. Also, my parents give me red envelopes.

**Speaker A:** That’s perfect! You can describe those activities and explain why they are meaningful to your family. Do you have any other traditions you want to include?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we also, um, clean the house together before the New Year. It is, um... how to say... for good luck.

**Speaker A:** Right, that’s a common tradition! Cleaning the house to sweep away bad luck and welcome good fortune. That’s a wonderful detail to add. How about the length of the essay? Do you know how long it should be?

**Speaker B:** The instructions say it should be, um, 500 words.

**Speaker A:** Got it. So, you’ll have plenty of room to describe all those traditions and why they are important to you. Do you have any other questions about the assignment?

**Speaker B:** No, I think I understand now. Thank you so much for helping me!

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! I’m glad I could help. If you have any more questions, just let me know. Good luck with your essay!

**Speaker B:** Thank you! I will start working on it right away. See you in class!

**Speaker A:** See you then! Bye, Xiao Li!

**Speaker B:** Bye!
