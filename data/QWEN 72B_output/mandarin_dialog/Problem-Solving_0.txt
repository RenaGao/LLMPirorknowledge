**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! Thanks for meeting me today. I wanted to talk about what happened last weekend.

**Speaker B (L2):** Oh, hi! No problem. I know we need to talk. I feel... um, a little bit confused.

**Speaker A:** I understand. I just want to clear things up. I didn’t mean to upset you when I said you should try new things.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I know. But sometimes, um, I feel like you push me too hard. It make me uncomfortable.

**Speaker A:** I’m really sorry about that. I didn’t realize it made you feel that way. It’s important to me that you’re comfortable.

**Speaker B:** That’s good to hear. I also sorry. I think I overreact a little bit.

**Speaker A:** No, it’s okay. Let’s move forward and be more open with each other about how we feel.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I agree. Um, maybe we can find activities that both of us like.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a great idea! What do you think about trying a new hobby together, like painting or hiking?

**Speaker B:** Hiking sounds good! And painting too, but I not very good at painting.

**Speaker A:** That’s okay! It’s about having fun and trying something new. We can learn together.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I like that. It will be fun.

**Speaker A:** Great! So, how about we plan a hiking trip next weekend?

**Speaker B:** Sure, that works for me. What time we meet?

**Speaker A:** Let’s meet at the park entrance at 9 a.m., okay?

**Speaker B:** 9 a.m. sounds good. I will be there.

**Speaker A:** Perfect! Thanks, Xiao Li. I’m glad we talked this out.

**Speaker B:** Me too. See you next weekend!

**Speaker A:** See you then! Have a good week!
