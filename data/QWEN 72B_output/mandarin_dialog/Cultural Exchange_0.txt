**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey Xiao Li, nice to meet you! I’m curious about Chinese traditions. Could you tell me about a festival in China?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi, nice to meet you too! Um, yes, of course! Let me think... how to say... one of the most important festivals in China is Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I’ve heard of it! Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B:** Sure! Spring Festival is, um, to celebrate the start of Chinese New Year. It is, uh, usually in January or February, depend on the lunar calendar.

**Speaker A:** That’s interesting! How do people celebrate it?

**Speaker B:** People, uh, clean their house and decorate it with red paper and lanterns. Red is very lucky color. And, um, families get together for a big dinner on New Year’s Eve.

**Speaker A:** What kind of food do you eat?

**Speaker B:** We eat many special foods, like dumplings, fish, and, uh, niangao. Dumplings are, um, shaped like gold ingots, symbolize wealth. Fish means, uh, surplus, and niangao means, um, higher every year.

**Speaker A:** Wow, those sound delicious! Any other traditions?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we, um, give red envelopes, or hongbao, to children. The money inside is for good luck. And, uh, there are firecrackers and fireworks to scare away bad spirits.

**Speaker A:** That sounds really festive! Do you have any particular memories from celebrating it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I remember, um, when I was a child, me and my, uh, cousins would, uh, play together and, um, watch the dragon dance in the streets. It was, uh, very exciting.

**Speaker A:** That sounds amazing! Are there any other unique customs?

**Speaker B:** Um, yes, people, uh, write couplets and paste them on doors. The couplets have, uh, good wishes and, uh, hopes for the new year.

**Speaker A:** That’s really beautiful! Do people still follow these traditions today?

**Speaker B:** Yes, many people, um, still celebrate, uh, the traditional way. But, uh, some, um, modernize it a bit, like using, uh, digital red envelopes on, uh, WeChat or Alipay.

**Speaker A:** That’s really interesting! Thanks so much for sharing, Xiao Li.

**Speaker B:** You’re welcome! I, uh, happy to share. Spring Festival is, um, very important to us.

**Speaker A:** It definitely sounds like a wonderful celebration. Thanks again, and see you next time!

**Speaker B:** No problem! See you, and have a good day!
