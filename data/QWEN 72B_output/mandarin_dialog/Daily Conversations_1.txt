**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey, Xiao Li! How's it going? Do you have any plans for this weekend?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! Um, I am good. How to say... free this weekend. Do you have plans?

**Speaker A:** That's great! I was thinking of going to the park. The weather has been really nice lately. What do you think?

**Speaker B:** Oh, that sounds good! I like park. What we can do there?

**Speaker A:** We could ride bikes or have a picnic. Both sound like fun, don't they?

**Speaker B:** Yes, very good ideas! Um... how to say... rent bikes? Where can we rent them?

**Speaker A:** There's a place right at the park entrance. I went there last time, and they have a good selection.

**Speaker B:** Ah, I see. So, um... when we meet?

**Speaker A:** How about 10 a.m. on Saturday?

**Speaker B:** 10 a.m. Saturday. That is good time. No problem!

**Speaker A:** Great! I'll see you then. Don't forget to bring a jacket; it might get a bit chilly in the evening.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will remember. Thanks for reminding me. See you this weekend!

**Speaker A:** Sounds perfect! Have a good week, Xiao Li!

**Speaker B:** You too! Bye!
