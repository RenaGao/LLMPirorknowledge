**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey Xiao Li, how’s it going? I heard it’s your friend’s birthday soon. Do you have any ideas for a surprise?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Oh, hi! Yeah, it is. We want to do something special. Um, how to say... do together, you know?

**Speaker A:** Definitely! What about organizing a small party at a park? It’s a nice day outside.

**Speaker B:** Park, yes! Good idea. We can play game, maybe?

**Speaker A:** That’s a great idea! What kind of games do you think they’d enjoy?

**Speaker B:** Um, frisbee, maybe? And, uh, picnic. We can bring food and drinks.

**Speaker A:** Sounds perfect! We can also set up a little area with some chairs and a table if you want.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that would be nice. And, um, maybe we can bring cake and balloons?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely! Balloons and a birthday cake will make it feel more festive. Do you want to take care of the cake?

**Speaker B:** Sure, I can do that. And, um, I can also invite other friends. You think ten people is good number?

**Speaker A:** Ten sounds perfect. It’s big enough to be fun but not too crowded. What about the time? How about 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B:** 2 p.m., yes. That is good time. We can meet at park entrance, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly! We’ll all meet at the park entrance at 2 p.m. and surprise them together.

**Speaker B:** Great! I will send message to everyone and confirm. Um, anything else we need to prepare?

**Speaker A:** Let’s make sure everyone brings something to share, like snacks or drinks. And maybe we can make a small gift card together?

**Speaker B:** Yes, good idea. I will ask friends to write message. We can put in nice card.

**Speaker A:** Perfect! This is all coming together really well. Thank you for your help, Xiao Li.

**Speaker B:** You are welcome. I am excited! See you at park on Saturday.

**Speaker A:** See you then! Have a great week, Xiao Li.

**Speaker B:** You too! Bye!
