**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Need some help?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Ah, yes, thank you. I am looking for... um, how to say... the Sunflower Hotel. It is nearby?

**Speaker A:** Sure, I can help you with that. Where are you right now?

**Speaker B:** I am at the train station. Near the... um, ticket office.

**Speaker A:** Got it. From the train station, you need to walk straight for about two blocks. You'll see a big park on your left.

**Speaker B:** Ah, the park. I see. And then what?

**Speaker A:** After you pass the park, turn right onto Main Street. The Sunflower Hotel is about three blocks down on your left. It's a tall building with a yellow sign.

**Speaker B:** Yellow sign, okay. Three blocks on left. Thank you very much. I think I can find it.

**Speaker A:** No problem at all! If you get confused, just ask someone. They're usually very helpful around here.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will. Um, one more thing. Is it far to walk?

**Speaker A:** It's not too far, about a 10-minute walk. It's a nice area, so you'll enjoy the walk.

**Speaker B:** Ten minutes, that is good. Thank you very much for your help.

**Speaker A:** You're welcome! If you need any more help, feel free to ask. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** Thank you! You too. Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Goodbye! Safe travels!
