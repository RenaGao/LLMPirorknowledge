**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey Xiao Ming! How are you? I heard you’re planning a surprise party for Xiao Li. That sounds fun!

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! Yes, I am. Xiao Li’s birthday is coming up soon. She really like surprises. Um... how to say... it will be a nice thing to make her happy.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely! What kind of party are you thinking about?

**Speaker B:** I want to do it at my place. It is big enough for everyone. We can play games and eat some good food. Maybe... um, we can have a cake and some snacks.

**Speaker A:** That sounds great! Have you decided on a date yet?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I think next Saturday will be good. Everyone can come. It is a weekend, so no one has work.

**Speaker A:** Perfect! How about the guest list? Who are you inviting?

**Speaker B:** I will invite our close friends from school and work. Maybe about... um, ten people. I will send them a message later to confirm.

**Speaker A:** Good idea! What about decorations? Do you need any help with that?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I need to buy some balloons and streamers. I also want to make some posters. You can help me with that, right?

**Speaker A:** Of course! I can come over on Friday to help you set everything up. What time should I come?

**Speaker B:** How about... um, three o'clock? That should give us enough time to finish.

**Speaker A:** Sounds good to me! We can also make a playlist for the party. Do you have any songs in mind?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will pick some songs that Xiao Li likes. She loves pop music and some oldies.

**Speaker A:** Great! And what about the cake? Are you going to bake it or buy one?

**Speaker B:** I think I will buy one. I am not a good baker. But I will make some cookies and other snacks.

**Speaker A:** That’s a good plan! It’s going to be a lot of fun. Anything else we should prepare?

**Speaker B:** Um... we should also think about some party games. I will look some up online and send you the list. We can decide together.

**Speaker A:** Perfect! I’m excited for the party! See you on Friday at three.

**Speaker B:** Yes, see you then! Thanks for helping me. It means a lot.

**Speaker A:** No problem at all! Let’s make it a memorable day for Xiao Li. Have a good day, Xiao Ming!

**Speaker B:** You too! Bye!

**Speaker A:** Bye! Take care!
