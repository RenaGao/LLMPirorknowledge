**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! Thanks for coming in today. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A:** I'm doing well, thanks. So, I understand you're interested in starting a new exercise routine. What kind of goals do you have in mind?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I want to... um, how to say... be more healthy and strong. And maybe lose some weight.

**Speaker A:** That's great! Losing weight and building strength are common goals. Have you tried any exercises before?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I try running and sometimes... uh, doing push-ups and sit-ups at home.

**Speaker A:** Good start! Running and bodyweight exercises are excellent. How often do you currently exercise?

**Speaker B:** I try to exercise three times a week, but sometimes... um, I am busy and can only do it two times.

**Speaker A:** That's totally fine. Consistency is key. What’s your schedule like? When do you find the best time to exercise?

**Speaker B:** I think morning is best for me. I can wake up early and do some exercise before work.

**Speaker A:** Morning workouts are a great way to start the day. What kind of exercises do you enjoy the most?

**Speaker B:** I like running and cycling. Um, I also enjoy yoga, but I am not very good at it yet.

**Speaker A:** Yoga is a fantastic way to improve flexibility and balance. We can definitely include some yoga sessions in your routine. How about strength training? Have you tried lifting weights?

**Speaker B:** Not really. I am a little scared of hurting myself.

**Speaker A:** That’s understandable. We can start with light weights and focus on proper form to ensure safety. We can gradually increase the weight as you get more comfortable.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that sounds good. I want to learn how to do it right.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely! We’ll make sure you’re comfortable and confident. How about we start with a basic plan: three days a week, alternating between running, strength training, and yoga?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that sounds great! I will try my best to follow it.

**Speaker A:** Perfect! We’ll also set some specific goals, like running a certain distance or lifting a certain weight, to keep you motivated. Sound good?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that is very helpful. Thank you so much!

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! I’m here to support you. Let’s check in next week to see how you’re doing. Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** Thanks! See you next week!
