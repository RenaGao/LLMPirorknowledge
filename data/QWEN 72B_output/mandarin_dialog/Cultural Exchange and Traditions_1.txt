**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! How are you today? I heard you recently had a big family dinner. How was it?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi, I am good, thank you. Yes, it was very nice. Um... how to say... We had lots of food and family. It was very big dinner.

**Speaker A:** That sounds wonderful! What kind of food did you have?

**Speaker B:** We had, um, dumplings, hot pot, and some fish. In China, fish is very important for New Year. It means, um... how to say... prosperity.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's really interesting! In the U.S., we also have special foods for holidays, like turkey for Thanksgiving. But, I noticed you mentioned some specific dining etiquette. Can you tell me more about that?

**Speaker B:** Yes, in China, we have many rules for eating. For example, we should not point chopsticks at people. It is, um... how to say... rude. Also, we should not stick chopsticks in the rice. It looks like, um... how to say... a grave.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I didn’t know that! Those are important things to remember. Do you have any other etiquette rules?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we also should wait for the oldest person to start eating first. It shows respect. And, um, we should not finish all the food on the plate. It means there is, um... how to say... enough food.

**Speaker A:** That’s really fascinating! In the U.S., we often try to finish everything on our plates to show we enjoyed the meal. It’s interesting how different cultures have different customs.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is very different. Um, in the U.S., do you have any special rules for eating?

**Speaker A:** Sure! In the U.S., we use knives and forks for most meals. We usually keep our hands on the table, but not our elbows. And it’s polite to wait for everyone to be served before starting to eat.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I see. So, it is important to, um, how to say... pay attention to the table manners.

**Speaker A:** Exactly! It’s all about showing respect and making everyone feel comfortable. Have you had any experiences with U.S. dining etiquette?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I have been to some American restaurants. It was, um, a bit different, but very fun. I learned a lot.

**Speaker A:** That’s great! It’s always exciting to experience new cultures. Thanks for sharing all this with me, Xiao Li. It was really interesting to learn about Chinese dining etiquette.

**Speaker B:** You are welcome! It was nice to talk with you. Um, how to say... see you later!

**Speaker A:** Sure thing! Take care, Xiao Li!
