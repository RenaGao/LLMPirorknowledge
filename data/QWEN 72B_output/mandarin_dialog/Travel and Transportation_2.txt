**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Xiao Ming! How’s it going? I was thinking we could plan a group vacation soon. What do you think?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! I am good, thank you. Group vacation? Sounds fun! You have idea for place?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I was thinking maybe we could go to the beach. It’s been so long since we all got together. What do you think?

**Speaker B:** Beach is good! But... um, how to say... I prefer mountains. Maybe we can go to a place with mountains? It is more peaceful.

**Speaker A:** That’s a great idea too! How about a place that has both mountains and a beach? Like a coastal town with some hiking trails nearby.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that sounds perfect! We can swim and also hike. What place you have in mind?

**Speaker A:** I was thinking maybe we could go to Cape Cod in Massachusetts. It’s beautiful and has some great hiking spots.

**Speaker B:** Cape Cod? I know that place. It is famous for beach and nature. Yes, I like it.

**Speaker A:** Great! What about the dates? Do you have any specific times that work for you?

**Speaker B:** Next month is good for me. But... um, can we check with others? Maybe they have different plan.

**Speaker A:** Sure, I’ll send a message to everyone and see what dates work for the group. What kind of activities do you want to do there?

**Speaker B:** We can go swimming, hiking, and maybe have a picnic. Oh, and take pictures! I like taking pictures.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a lot of fun! And we can also try some local food. There are some great seafood places in Cape Cod.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I love seafood. That will be great.

**Speaker A:** Awesome! I’ll start making the plans and send you the details. How does that sound?

**Speaker B:** Sounds perfect! Thank you for organizing this.

**Speaker A:** No problem! I’m excited. Let’s keep in touch and finalize everything soon.

**Speaker B:** Yes, definitely. Talk to you later! Goodbye!

**Speaker A:** Bye, Xiao Ming! Have a great day!
