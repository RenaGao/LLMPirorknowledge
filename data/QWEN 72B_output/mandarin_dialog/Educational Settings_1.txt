**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li! How’s it going? 

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A:** I’m doing well, thanks. Hey, I heard we have a big test coming up next week. Have you started preparing?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I started yesterday. It is a lot of material to cover. You?

**Speaker A:** I’m planning to start this weekend. What do you think about studying together? We can share tips and help each other out.

**Speaker B:** Good idea! I think it will be helpful. Um, how to say... we can go over the chapters together and practice questions.

**Speaker A:** Exactly! Do you have any specific topics you’re struggling with?

**Speaker B:** Yes, the part about chemical reactions. I always get confused with the formulas.

**Speaker B (correcting self):** I mean, the formulas are confusing to me.

**Speaker A:** No problem, I can help with that. I find it easier if we break it down step by step. And we can use flashcards to memorize the formulas.

**Speaker B:** That sounds good. I also have some practice problems that we can work on together.

**Speaker A:** Great! When and where should we meet?

**Speaker B:** How about Saturday afternoon at the library?

**Speaker A:** Sure, what time works for you?

**Speaker B:** Three o'clock?

**Speaker A:** Three o'clock works for me. We can start with the chemical reactions and then move on to the practice problems.

**Speaker B:** Sounds perfect. I will bring my notes and the textbook.

**Speaker A:** Awesome! Looking forward to it. See you at the library on Saturday!

**Speaker B:** See you then! Thanks for the help!

**Speaker A:** No problem, take care!
