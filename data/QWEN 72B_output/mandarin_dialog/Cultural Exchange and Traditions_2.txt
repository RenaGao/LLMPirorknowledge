**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! How are you today?

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. We’re thinking about planning a cultural event to share our traditions. What do you think?

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Oh, that is great idea! I like to share my culture. What we can do?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome! We could start by sharing some traditional food. Do you have any dishes in mind?

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Yes! We can make dumplings. And also, um, hotpot. People like them very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Dumplings and hotpot sound delicious! What about some traditional music or dance?

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Ah, good idea! We can have erhu music. It is... um, Chinese violin. And also, dragon dance. It is very exciting.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect! Dragon dance would be a great addition. How about some games or activities to engage everyone?

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Yes, we can play mahjong. It is fun game. And also, um... how to say... calligraphy writing. People like to try.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great suggestions! Calligraphy writing would be a wonderful activity. What about decorations? Any ideas?

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** We can use red paper lanterns. And also, Chinese knots. They are very beautiful and mean good luck.

**Speaker A (NS):** Red lanterns and Chinese knots sound perfect! They’ll really add to the atmosphere. How should we organize this event? Do you have any thoughts?

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** We can set up tables for food, music, and games. And also, have stage for dragon dance. We need to invite many people to join.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! We can start by making a list of all the things we need and then divide the tasks among everyone. What do you think?

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Sounds good to me! I can help with food and decorations. And also, invite my friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll handle the music and games. Let’s set a date and time. How about next Saturday at 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B (Mandarin L2):** Yes, that work for me. We can meet at the community center?
