**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey Xiao Li, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi, I am good. How are you?

**Speaker A:** I'm doing well, thanks! I just wanted to talk to you about something. I made a mistake with the schedule for our meeting this weekend. I thought it was for 11 a.m., but it’s actually at 10 a.m.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I see. That’s okay. No problem. Um, how to say... I can adjust my time.

**Speaker A:** Great! I really appreciate your understanding. I’m so sorry for the confusion.

**Speaker B:** No worries. It's not a big deal. I just need to wake up a little earlier.

**Speaker A:** I hope it’s not too much trouble. Is there anything I can do to make it easier for you?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, maybe... can we meet at the park entrance at 9:45 a.m.? That way, I have some extra time to get ready.

**Speaker A:** That’s a great idea! Meeting at 9:45 a.m. will give us plenty of time to get settled. Thank you for being so flexible.

**Speaker B:** You are welcome. It’s fine. I am happy to meet you.

**Speaker A:** Awesome! I’ll see you at the park entrance then. If there are any other issues, feel free to let me know.

**Speaker B:** Sure, no problem. I will text you if I have any questions.

**Speaker A:** Sounds good. Have a great day, and see you this weekend!

**Speaker B:** You too! See you then. Bye!
