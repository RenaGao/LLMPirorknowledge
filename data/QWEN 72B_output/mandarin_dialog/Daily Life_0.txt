**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey Xiao Li, how’s it going? 

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! I good. How you?

**Speaker A:** I’m doing well, thanks! What’s your morning routine like?

**Speaker B:** Um, my morning routine... I wake up early, about... six o’clock. Then, I... um, wash face and brush teeth.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a good start. Do you have breakfast?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I have breakfast. Usually, I eat... um, how to say... rice porridge. And sometimes, I eat bread with jam.

**Speaker A:** Rice porridge sounds interesting! Do you cook it yourself?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I cook it. It is easy to make. Then, I... um, read news on my phone.

**Speaker A:** That’s a good way to start the day. Do you exercise in the morning?

**Speaker B:** Sometimes. I try to go for a run, but not every day. If I have time, I go to park and run.

**Speaker A:** That’s great! Staying active is important. What do you do after your morning routine?

**Speaker B:** After, I go to work. I take... um, bus. It take about thirty minutes.

**Speaker A:** Thirty minutes, that’s not too bad. Do you listen to music or podcasts on the bus?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I listen to music. It help me relax.

**Speaker A:** Nice! What kind of music do you like?

**Speaker B:** I like... um, pop music. And sometimes, classical music.

**Speaker A:** Cool! Any favorite artists?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I like Taylor Swift. And also, some Chinese singers like Jay Chou.

**Speaker A:** Great choices! So, your morning routine is pretty straightforward but well-rounded. Wake up early, have breakfast, read news, and then head to work with some music. Sounds like a good way to start the day!

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is. It help me feel good for the day.

**Speaker A:** Glad to hear that! Well, I should get going. Have a great day, Xiao Li!

**Speaker B:** You too! Bye!
