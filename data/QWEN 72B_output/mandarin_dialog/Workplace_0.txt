**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, Xiao Li! Thanks for coming in today. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How you doing?

**Speaker A:** I'm doing well, thanks! We need to discuss the upcoming project deadline. When is the final submission due?

**Speaker B:** Um, the deadline is... let me check... next Friday.

**Speaker A:** Next Friday, got it. Do you have any concerns about meeting the deadline?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I... um, worry about... how to say... the workload. It is big project, and team members also have other things.

**Speaker A:** I understand. Is there anything specific that’s causing the most concern?

**Speaker B:** The data analysis part. It need lot of time and... um, skills. I think we need more person to help.

**Speaker A:** That makes sense. Have you talked to the team about it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I talk to them. They say they can help, but they also busy.

**Speaker A:** Okay. How about we schedule a team meeting to discuss this? We can find the best way to distribute the tasks.

**Speaker B:** Good idea! When we have meeting?

**Speaker A:** How about tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B:** 2 p.m. is fine. I will tell the team.

**Speaker A:** Great! And if you have any other issues, feel free to come to me. I want to make sure everyone is comfortable and the project is on track.

**Speaker B:** Thank you! I will. Um, anything else we need talk about?

**Speaker A:** I think that covers everything. Thanks for bringing up the concerns. I’ll see you tomorrow at the meeting.

**Speaker B:** Yes, see you tomorrow. Thank you!

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome. Have a good day, Xiao Li!

**Speaker B:** You too! Bye!
