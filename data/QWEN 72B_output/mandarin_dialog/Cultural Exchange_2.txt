**Speaker A:** Oh, that’s a big celebration! What do you usually do during Chinese New Year?

**Speaker B:** We have big family dinner. And, um... we eat many good food. Also, we watch special TV show together.

**Speaker A:** That sounds really fun! What’s your favorite part of the celebration?

**Speaker B:** I like family dinner. We all together. And, um... we eat dumpling. It is tradition.

**Speaker A:** Dumplings are a big part of the holiday, huh? Do you have a favorite type of dumpling?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I like pork and cabbage dumpling. It is very delicious. And, um... we make it together with family.

**Speaker A:** That’s great! It sounds like a really special time. Do you have any other traditions?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we give red envelope. It is money in red paper. We give to children for good luck.

**Speaker A:** Red envelopes are such a nice tradition! Do you have any special decorations for the holiday?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we put up red lantern and, um... how to say... couplet. It is like poem on door.

**Speaker A:** Couplets! That’s a beautiful tradition. It sounds like the holiday is full of meaningful activities.
