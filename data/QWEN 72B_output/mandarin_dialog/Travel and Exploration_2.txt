**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A:** I’m doing well, thanks for asking! I’m new to this town and I was wondering if you could help me. Do you know where the main park is?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I know! Park... um, how to say... gōng yuán, is very nice here. It close to the city center. You want to go there?

**Speaker A:** That sounds perfect! Could you tell me how to get there from here?

**Speaker B:** Sure! First, you need to walk down this street until you see the big intersection. There have a big sign, you can’t miss it.

**Speaker A:** Got it. Then what should I do?

**Speaker B:** Turn right at the big sign. After you turn, you will walk for about five minute. Then, you see a small bridge.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and then?

**Speaker B:** Cross the bridge, and the park will be on your left side. It very big and have many trees.

**Speaker A:** That sounds really helpful. Is it a nice park to visit?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it very nice! You can ride bike, have picnic, or just relax. Many people go there, especially in good weather.

**Speaker A:** Perfect! Thanks for the information. What time do they open?

**Speaker B:** They open at 9 o’clock in the morning. You can go there any time after that.

**Speaker A:** Alright, I’ll head there around 10 a.m. Is that a good time?

**Speaker B:** Yes, 10 o’clock is very good. The weather is nice at that time.

**Speaker A:** That’s good to know. One last thing, do they accept credit cards?

**Speaker B:** Yes, they accept credit card. But also, you can pay with cash if you prefer.

**Speaker A:** Great, thanks so much for all the help, Xiao Li!
