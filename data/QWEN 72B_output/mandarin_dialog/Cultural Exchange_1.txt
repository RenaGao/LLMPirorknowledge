**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey Xiao Ming, how’s it going? I heard you’re planning a dinner with some friends. What kind of cuisine are you thinking about?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! I am good, thank you. Yes, we plan to have dinner this weekend. Maybe we try Italian food.

**Speaker A:** Italian sounds great! Do you know any good Italian restaurants around here?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, I think there is one near the park. It is called... um, how to say... "Trattoria Bella." Yes, Trattoria Bella.

**Speaker A:** Trattoria Bella, nice choice! Have you been there before?

**Speaker B:** No, I never go there. But I hear it is very good. You been there?

**Speaker A:** I haven’t, but I’ve heard good things. Do you have any specific dishes in mind?

**Speaker B:** I like pasta. Maybe we can try spaghetti... um, spaghetti Carbonara. And also, um... salad.

**Speaker A:** Spaghetti Carbonara and salad sound delicious. Speaking of food, have you noticed any differences in dining etiquette in our cultures?

**Speaker B:** Yes, definitely. In China, we often share dishes. Everyone put food on the same table and eat from it. But here, everyone orders their own meal.

**Speaker A:** That’s true. In the U.S., we usually order individual plates, but we sometimes share appetizers or family-style dishes. Do you miss the shared dining experience?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I miss it. It feel more... um, how to say... more connected with people. But I like trying new things too. What about you?

**Speaker A:** I enjoy both styles. It’s fun to try different ways of eating. Have you ever had any etiquette mishaps while dining out here?

**Speaker B:** Yes, one time I... um, how to say... I use the wrong fork. In China, we usually use chopsticks or a spoon, not many forks.

**Speaker A:** Ah, I see. Don’t worry, everyone makes mistakes. It’s part of the learning process. Any tips for me if I go to a Chinese restaurant?

**Speaker B:** Yes, sure. When you use chopsticks, do not point at people. And, um, do not stick them in your rice. It is not polite.

**Speaker A:** Got it, thanks for the tips! I’ll be sure to remember that. It sounds like we’re both learning a lot about each other’s cultures.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is very interesting. I think we can learn a lot from each other.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely! Well, it was great chatting with you. Looking forward to our dinner this weekend.

**Speaker B:** Me too! See you then. Bye!

**Speaker A:** Bye, Xiao Ming! Have a good one!
