**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS)**: Hi, Xiao Li! How are you today?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin)**: Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A**: I’m doing well, thanks! So, I was wondering, is there a skill you’ve been wanting to learn lately?

**Speaker B**: Yes, I want... um, learn... how to play piano.

**Speaker A**: That’s great! Why are you interested in learning the piano?

**Speaker B**: Because, um, music is very, very... important to me. And piano, it can make me... um, feel calm, you know?

**Speaker A**: Absolutely, music can be very calming. Have you played any other instruments before?

**Speaker B**: No, this is my... um, first time. But I think piano, it is good start.

**Speaker A**: That makes sense. What’s been your motivation for starting now?

**Speaker B**: Well, I... um, my friend, he play piano. And I see him, he looks so... um, happy when he play. I want to try too.

**Speaker A**: That’s a wonderful motivation! Have you started any lessons or are you thinking about it?

**Speaker B**: Yes, I already find one teacher. I will start next month.

**Speaker A**: That’s fantastic! How often will you be practicing?

**Speaker B**: I think, um, three times a week. Maybe more, if I have time.

**Speaker A**: That’s a good plan. Do you have any goals for what you want to achieve with the piano?

**Speaker B**: Yes, I want to, um, play some easy songs first. And then, maybe, um, some classical music.

**Speaker A**: That’s a great goal! Classical music can be very rewarding. What kind of classical music do you like?

**Speaker B**: I like... um, Beethoven and Mozart. They are very famous, right?

**Speaker A**: Definitely! Their music is beautiful. Do you have a favorite piece?

**Speaker B**: Yes, I like... um, Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven. It is very... um, beautiful and calm.

**Speaker A**: That’s a beautiful choice! I hope you get to play it one day. It’s a challenging but rewarding piece.

**Speaker B**: Yes, I hope so too! Thank you for talking with me about this.

**Speaker A**: Of course! It was great to hear about your passion for learning the piano. Have a great day, and good luck with your lessons!

**Speaker B**: Thank you! Goodbye!

**Speaker A**: Goodbye, Xiao Li! Take care!
