**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li! How are you? I heard you have some exciting goals for the next year. Can you tell me more about them?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi! Yes, I am good. Thank you for asking. Um, my goal is... I want to learn more about... um, how to say... photography. And also, I want to travel to different places.

**Speaker A:** That sounds great! Photography and travel are both fantastic goals. How do you plan to achieve them?

**Speaker B:** For photography, I want to take class. Like, um, online class. And also, practice more. For travel, I am saving money. I hope to visit... um, how to say... famous cities in China and maybe other countries too.

**Speaker A:** Taking online classes and practicing is a good plan. And saving money is a smart move for travel. Do you have any specific places in mind?

**Speaker B:** Yes! I want to go to Xi'an. It is famous for the terracotta warriors. And also, maybe Shanghai. It is big city and very modern. For other countries, I want to see... um, Paris. It is the city of love, right?

**Speaker A:** Xi'an and Shanghai are amazing choices, and Paris is a beautiful city. What kind of photography do you want to focus on?

**Speaker B:** I like... um, landscape and street photography. I think it is very interesting to capture the beauty of nature and the life of people in the city.

**Speaker A:** Landscape and street photography are great choices. They can really help you see new places in different ways. How often do you plan to practice?

**Speaker B:** I want to practice at least once a week. Maybe more if I can find time. And I will carry my camera everywhere I go, so I can take picture whenever I see something nice.

**Speaker A:** That’s a great strategy! Consistency is key in learning new skills. What kind of camera do you use?

**Speaker B:** I use my phone camera now. But I hope to buy a DSLR camera soon. I think it will help me take better pictures.

**Speaker A:** A DSLR is a great investment if you’re serious about photography. What other skills do you want to learn?

**Speaker B:** I want to learn about post-processing. Like, how to edit pictures to make them look better. And also, maybe learn some new languages. I think it will help me when I travel.

**Speaker A:** Post-processing and learning new languages are excellent goals. Do you have any specific languages in mind?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I want to learn English better. And maybe a little bit of French. It will help me when I travel to Paris.

**Speaker A:** That’s a great plan! Improving your English and learning French will definitely enhance your travel experience. How do you feel about all these goals?

**Speaker B:** I feel very excited! It is a lot, but I think I can do it. I will work hard and stay focused.

**Speaker A:** I have no doubt you will achieve them. Good luck with everything, Xiao Li!

**Speaker B:** Thank you! I will try my best. See you next time!

**Speaker A:** See you next time! Take care!
