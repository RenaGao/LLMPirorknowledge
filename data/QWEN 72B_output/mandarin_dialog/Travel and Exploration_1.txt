**Speaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li! How’s it going?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Hi, um, I am good. Thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A:** I’m doing well, thanks. So, can you tell me about your favorite place to visit?

**Speaker B:** Sure. My favorite place is... um, how to say... West Lake in Hangzhou. It is very beautiful.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I’ve heard of West Lake! What makes it special to you?

**Speaker B:** Well, it is very peaceful. You can go for walk, um, around the lake. There are many trees and flowers. It is very... um, relaxing.

**Speaker A:** That sounds wonderful. Have you been there many times?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I go there every year with my family. We like to, um, take boat ride and, um, eat, um, local food.

**Speaker A:** That’s great! What’s your favorite thing to do there?

**Speaker B:** My favorite thing is, um, to feed the fish in the lake. There are many, um, goldfish and carp. It is fun to watch them.

**Speaker A:** That sounds really fun! Are there any special events or festivals at West Lake?

**Speaker B:** Yes, there is, um, Dragon Boat Festival. People, um, race boats and, um, eat, um, special rice dumplings.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a fantastic festival! Have you ever participated in the boat races?

**Speaker B:** No, but I watch them. It is very exciting to see the, um, boats go so fast.

**Speaker A:** I bet! What about the food? What’s your favorite dish?

**Speaker B:** My favorite is, um, West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy. It is, um, very tasty and, um, a little sweet and sour.

**Speaker A:** That sounds delicious! I’d love to try it someday. Is there anything else you’d recommend to someone visiting West Lake?

**Speaker B:** Yes, you should, um, visit the, um, Leifeng Pagoda. It is very old and, um, has, um, nice view of the lake.

**Speaker A:** Great recommendation! Thank you for sharing all this with me, Xiao Li. It makes me want to visit West Lake!

**Speaker B:** You are welcome! I hope you can come and, um, see it sometime. It is, um, really special.

**Speaker A:** I definitely will. Thanks again! Have a great day!

**Speaker B:** You too! Bye!

**Speaker A:** Bye!
