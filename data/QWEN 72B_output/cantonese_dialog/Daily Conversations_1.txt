**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Wing, how are you? Got any plans for this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi Mei, I am good, thank you. Um, how to say... no plan yet. What about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking of going to the beach. The weather has been really nice lately. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Beach? Sound good! I like beach. We can do what?

**Speaker A (NS):** We could swim and sunbathe, and maybe grab some food too. Does that sound fun?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, very fun! I just buy new swimsuit. Um, perfect for beach.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What time should we meet on Saturday?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Uh, ten o'clock? Too early?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think 10 a.m. is just right. It’s usually cooler in the morning.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, ten o'clock, very good. Where we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s meet at the main entrance of the beach park. Is that okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, very okay. I know place. I go there before.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! We can bring some snacks and drinks too. Want to bring anything in particular?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I bring some fruit and water. Anything else need?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great. Maybe some beach towels and sunscreen?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, very good idea. I will bring towel and sunscreen.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! I can’t wait. It’s going to be a lot of fun.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Me too! See you Saturday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then, Wing! Have a great weekend!
