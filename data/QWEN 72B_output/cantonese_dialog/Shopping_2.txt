**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello! I want... um, return this jacket. It is... too small for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. No problem. Can you show me the receipt, please?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. Here is the receipt.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you. Can you tell me when you purchased this jacket?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I buy it... um, three week ago.

**Speaker A (NS):** Three weeks ago, okay. According to our return policy, we accept returns within 30 days, so you’re still within the window. Is the jacket in its original condition?
