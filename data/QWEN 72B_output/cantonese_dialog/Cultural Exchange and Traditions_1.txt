**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Wing, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I am good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I was thinking, since we both come from different cultures, it might be fun to talk about dining etiquette. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, um, I think is good idea. In Cantonese, we have many, many rules for eating.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! Could you tell me about some of the main rules?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sure. First, we not use chopsticks... um, like point people, or cross them. This very rude.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, I’ve heard that before. And what about other things like making noise while eating?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** In Cantonese, we try not to make noise. But, uh, slurping noodles little bit okay. It show food is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a neat custom! In many Western cultures, making noise while eating is considered impolite. How about seating arrangements? Do you have any specific rules?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, in Chinese, oldest or most important person sit at head of table. Also, guest of honor sit to right of host.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very thoughtful. In Western culture, the host usually sits at the head of the table, and the guest of honor can sit to the right or left of the host. Do you have any other interesting etiquette points?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes. We always say "請" (ching3) before meal. Is like "please" in English. And after meal, we say "多謝" (dou6 se6), thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice tradition! In Western culture, we usually say “bon appétit” before the meal and “thank you” or “thanks for the meal” after. What about using your hands to eat?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** In Chinese, we usually use chopsticks or spoon, not hands. Only for some food, like dumplings, we use hands. But we clean hands first.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. In Western culture, we use forks, knives, and spoons, but it’s common to eat things like sandwiches and pizza with your hands. It’s all about being tidy.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, very important to be clean. Also, in Chinese, we not take last piece of food from plate. Is show we not want more, and host give more if last piece gone.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great point! In Western culture, it’s usually okay to take the last piece, but it’s polite to ask if anyone else wants it first.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, is same idea, but different way. Um, one more thing, we not pour tea for ourselves. Always pour for others first, then self.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a very considerate practice! In Western culture, we often pour our own drinks, but it’s always nice to offer to pour for others too.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think this show respect. How about you, Mei, you have any other rules?

**Speaker A (NS):** One thing is that in Western culture, it’s important to use the correct utensils for each course. For example, a salad fork for salad and a dinner fork for the main dish.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I see. It is like we have different chopstick for different food. Interesting!

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! It’s all about showing respect and enjoying the meal together. Thanks for sharing all these with me, Wing!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, is fun to learn. Thank you, Mei. We talk more next time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure thing! Take care, Wing. It was great chatting with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bye, Mei. See you soon!
