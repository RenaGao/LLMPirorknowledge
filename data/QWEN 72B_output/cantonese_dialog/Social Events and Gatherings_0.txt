**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! Where are you from, Mei?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I from Hong Kong. It is very... um, how to say... lively city.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great way to describe it! Are you here for work or for fun?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I here for work. I work in marketing. What about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I work in tech. I help companies with their software needs. What kind of marketing do you do?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I do digital marketing. We use social media, email, and... um... SEO to promote our client's products.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, search engine optimization. That's really important these days. How did you get into marketing?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I study business in university. I like to... um... connect with people and I find marketing very... um... rewarding.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's awesome! What do you like to do in your free time, Mei?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like to travel and try new food. Also, I practice... um... yoga to relax.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yoga is a great way to unwind. Have you visited any interesting places recently?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I go to Japan last year. It is very beautiful. I like the culture and food so much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Japan is amazing! Have you tried making any Japanese dishes at home?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I try to make sushi and ramen. It is difficult, but fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! Do you have any hobbies besides yoga and cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like to read books and watch movies. I especially like... um... how to say... comedy and romance.

**Speaker A (NS):** I love those genres too! Do you have any favorite books or movies you'd recommend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sure! I like "Pride and Prejudice" and "Crazy Rich Asians." They are both very good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choices! I've enjoyed both of those as well. Well, it's been great chatting with you, Mei. We should catch up again soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is nice to talk with you, Alex. I hope we can meet again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Mei! Take care!
