**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Mei, how’s it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hey, I’m good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks! I was thinking, have you ever compared dining etiquette in different cultures?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes, a bit. I think it very different. In Hong Kong, we have many rules, like no putting chopsticks in the middle of the bowl.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true! It’s considered bad luck, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is. And also, we don’t tap the bowl with chopsticks. It like begging.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. In the U.S., we don’t have as many chopstick rules, but we do have some table manners. For example, we keep our elbows off the table.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Elbows off table? Why?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s considered polite and helps you maintain good posture. Also, we often wait for everyone to be served before we start eating.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** In Hong Kong, we wait too. But sometimes, if host say you can eat, you can start.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. And what about making noise while eating? I’ve heard that slurping noodles is acceptable in some cultures.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, in Japan, it show you enjoy the food. But in Hong Kong, we try to be quiet.

**Speaker A (NS):** Interesting! It’s so different. In the U.S., we try to be quiet too, but sometimes it’s hard not to make noise, especially with certain foods.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I understand. Um, how to say... it can be tricky when you visit new place.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, it can be a bit overwhelming. But it’s also a great way to learn and understand different cultures.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I agree. Learning new things always good.

**Speaker A (NS):** So, what’s the most surprising dining etiquette you’ve come across?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I think in some Middle Eastern countries, they eat with right hand. It very different from using utensils.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really interesting! I didn’t know that. It shows how diverse dining customs can be.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it really does. We learn a lot from each other.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Well, thanks for sharing all this with me, Mei. It was a great conversation.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You’re welcome! Same here. Talk to you again soon, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure thing, take care! Bye!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bye! Take care!
