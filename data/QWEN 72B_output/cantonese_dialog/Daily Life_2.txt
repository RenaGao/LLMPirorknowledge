**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Wing! It's great to meet you. I heard you’re moving in this weekend. How are you settling in?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, hello! I am good, thank you. I still very excited. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks! I hope you’re ready for a fun weekend. By the way, what's your favorite meal? Maybe we can cook it together this weekend.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** My favorite meal is... um, congee. You know congee? It is like very thin rice soup. My mother often make for me when I sick.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I know congee! It’s a great comfort food. It would be fun to make it together. Can you tell me how you prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, sure! First, I need to soak rice for about... um, half hour. Then, I put rice in pot with a lot of water and boil it. After that, I turn heat to low and simmer for maybe one hour.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. That sounds pretty straightforward. What kind of ingredients do you add to the congee?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I add some... um, ginger and scallions. Sometimes, I put in some chicken or pork. It make congee more tasty. And I also add a little salt and pepper.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Do you have any special tips for making the congee even better?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think important to stir congee often while it cook. This help rice break down and make congee more smooth. And I always check water level, make sure it not dry out.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great tips! I’ll make sure to follow them. How about we plan to cook it on Sunday? That way, we can both enjoy a relaxing morning.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think Sunday good. What time we start?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 10 a.m.? That should give us plenty of time to cook and enjoy it.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** 10 a.m. sound good to me. I will bring some ingredients from my place.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll get the rest. I’m looking forward to it. Thanks, Wing!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you too! See you Sunday morning!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a good day!
