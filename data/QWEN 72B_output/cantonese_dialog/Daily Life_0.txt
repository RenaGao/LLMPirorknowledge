**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Wing, how are you? What’s your morning routine like these days?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hey Mei, I am good. Um... my morning... I wake up... um, seven o'clock. Yes, seven o'clock. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s similar to me. I usually wake up around 7:30. What do you do after you wake up?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I... um, brush tooth and shower. Then, I make breakfast. I like to eat... um, porridge. Porridge is good for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Porridge is a great choice! What kind of porridge do you usually have?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I make congee. You know, the Chinese porridge. I put some, um... vegetables and egg. It is, how to say... nutritious.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really healthy! Do you have time for any exercise in the morning?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I do. I go for a walk... um, around my neighborhood. It is... um, refreshing. I feel good after.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome. I usually do a quick yoga session in the morning. It helps me start the day feeling calm.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yoga is good. I try it once. It is... um, how to say... challenging but relaxing.

**Speaker A (NS):** It definitely is! What time do you usually leave for work or start your day?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I usually, um... leave at, um, nine o'clock. I work from home now, so I start work at... um, nine thirty.

**Speaker A (NS):** Working from home can be nice. Do you have any other morning rituals?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I read the news and check emails. I like to stay informed. And, um, I make a to-do list. It helps me organize my day.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great habit! I also make a to-do list. It keeps me on track. What do you like the most about your morning routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I like the, um, quiet time. It is... um, peaceful. I feel, um, more focused and ready for the day.

**Speaker A (NS):** I completely agree. Mornings can be so peaceful and setting a good tone for the day. Thanks for sharing, Wing. We should catch up more often!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we should. Thank you, Mei. Take care!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! See you soon!
