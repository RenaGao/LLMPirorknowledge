**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Wing! How are you feeling today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, hello! I, um, not feel very good. I have... um, headache and... cough.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. How long have you had these symptoms?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, about three day, I think. Maybe... four?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. Do you have any other symptoms, like a fever or a runny nose?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, yes, I have fever. And my nose... um, runny nose. Also, I feel very tired.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds tough. Have you taken any medicine?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I take... um, paracetamol. But I not feel better yet.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Have you been experiencing any other discomfort, like body aches or a sore throat?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I have sore throat. And my body... um, ache all over.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Have you been around anyone who has been sick recently?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, no. I not go out much. Just stay home.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. It’s important to rest and stay hydrated. I’ll prescribe some medication to help with your symptoms. Do you have any allergies?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I no have allergy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. I’ll also recommend you get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. If you don’t see improvement in a few days, please come back and see me.
