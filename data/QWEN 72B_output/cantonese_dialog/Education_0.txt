**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Wing! How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hey, Mei! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. Are you ready for the exam next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I think I am not ready yet. I still have many things need to study.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, it’s a tough one. What subjects are you focusing on?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I focus on math and science. Math is very hard for me. I don’t understand some of the formula.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Maybe we can study together sometime. It helps to go over the formulas with someone else.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that would be good! I think if we study together, I can understand better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! When are you free this week?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I am free on Wednesday and Friday. Wednesday is better for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wednesday works for me too. What time?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** How about four o’clock in the library?

**Speaker A (NS):** Four o’clock sounds good. We can meet there and go over the formulas and some practice problems.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, practice problems help a lot. I will bring my notes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. And if you have any questions before then, just text me, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, thank you! I will do that. See you on Wednesday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you on Wednesday! Good luck with your studies, Wing!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thanks, Mei! You too! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Take care!
