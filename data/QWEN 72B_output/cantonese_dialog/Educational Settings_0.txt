**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Wing, how are you doing today? How’s the assignment coming along?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, hello! I am okay, thank you. The assignment, um, I have problem with it. Can you help me, please?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What part of the assignment is giving you trouble?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** The part about, um, the essay. I not sure how to start it. And also, I no understand the question fully.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Can you read the question to me? Maybe I can help clarify it.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sure. The question is: "Discuss the impact of social media on young people’s mental health." I no sure what to write about the impact.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let’s break it down. The question is asking you to talk about how social media affects the mental health of young people. Do you think social media has positive or negative effects?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think, um, both. Some people say it help, but also, it can make people feel bad.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You could start by outlining both the positive and negative impacts. For example, positive impacts might include connecting with friends and finding support groups. Negative impacts could include things like cyberbullying or feeling pressure to present a perfect life online.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that make sense. I can write about that. But, um, how to structure the essay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. A typical essay structure would be: introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. In the introduction, you can state your thesis, which is your main argument. The body paragraphs should each discuss a different point, and the conclusion summarizes your main points and restates your thesis.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I see. So, in introduction, I say what I will talk about. In body, I give examples and explain. In conclusion, I summarize everything. Is that right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly right! And don’t forget to use evidence to support your points, like studies or statistics. That will make your argument stronger.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will do that. Thank you so much for your help, really!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Wing! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Good luck with your essay!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you! I will try my best. See you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care! See you!
