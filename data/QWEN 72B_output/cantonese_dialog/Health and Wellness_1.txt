**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for coming in today. My name is Alex, and I'm a fitness trainer. How about you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello, I am Mei. Nice to meet you. I want to... um, get fit and healthy.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great goal, Mei! Can you tell me a bit more about what you have in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I want to lose some weight and have more... more... energy, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I understand. How often do you currently exercise?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Now, I go... um, go gym two time in week. But I want to do more.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start. What kind of exercises do you usually do?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I do some running, and also, um... how to say... weight lifting?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, weight lifting. That’s great. Have you tried any other types of exercise, like cardio or yoga?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I try yoga, but I find it... um, hard to focus. Maybe I try more cardio?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, cardio can be a lot of fun and really effective. Do you have any specific goals in mind, like a target weight or a particular event?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I want to run 5K race in three month. That is my goal.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a fantastic goal! We can definitely work on a plan to help you achieve it. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sound good! I... I trust you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll put together a workout plan that includes both cardio and strength training. We’ll start with three days a week and see how it goes.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Three days, okay. I can do that. Thank you, Alex.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Mei! If you have any questions or need adjustments, just let me know. How about we schedule our next session for next Tuesday?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, Tuesday is good. See you next Tuesday!

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! See you then, Mei. Take care.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too. Goodbye!
