**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Mei! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I am good. You are good, yeah? How to say... I have some question. I want stay healthy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I’m happy to help. What kind of advice are you looking for?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, how to eat good and exercise. I not sure I do right.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great place to start. Eating well and exercising are key. For eating, it’s important to have a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Fruits and vegetables, yeah. I know. But, how much I need eat every day?

**Speaker A (NS):** A good rule of thumb is to try to have at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. That’s about two cups of fruit and two and a half cups of vegetables.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ok, five. I try do that. And for exercise, what you think?

**Speaker A (NS):** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week. That could be walking, running, swimming, or even dancing.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Dancing? I like dancing! But, I not sure I can do 150 minutes. Is too much?

**Speaker A (NS):** It might seem like a lot, but you can break it down into smaller sessions. For example, 30 minutes of exercise five days a week.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, 30 minutes... that is better. I can do that. And what about drink? I need drink water, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Staying hydrated is very important. Try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Eight glasses, ok. I will try remember that. Thank you, Wing. You help me a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Mei! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Staying healthy is a journey, and I’m here to support you.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you so much. I feel good now. Um, we can talk again soon?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! We can catch up next week and see how you’re doing. Take care, Mei!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ok, bye-bye! See you next week. Thank you!
