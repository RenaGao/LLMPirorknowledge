**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Wing! Thanks for meeting today. How are you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, hi Mei! I am good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks! Um, I wanted to talk about the project we’re working on. We need to figure out the next steps.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, the project. I think we need to... um, how to say... organize our tasks better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Let’s make a plan. What do you think we should do first?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** First, um, we need to finish the market research, right? That is important.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s a good point. We should wrap that up. How about we set a deadline for it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** OK, um, how about... next Friday? Is that too soon?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think next Friday is fine. What do you think about dividing the tasks between us?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that is good idea. I can work on... um, the data analysis part. You can... um, do the report writing?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. I’ll handle the report writing. We should also check in with each other regularly to make sure we’re on track.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we can have meeting... um, every week, maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Every week works. How about we meet on Mondays at 10 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** 10 a.m. is good. Um, Monday morning is not too busy for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And let’s use a shared document to keep track of our progress.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I can create Google Doc. That is easy for both of us.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s get started on that. Does everything sound good to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, everything is clear. I will send you the link for the document later today.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, Wing! I’ll look out for it. We’re making good progress.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think we are. Thanks for your help, Mei.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Talk to you soon. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! See you on Monday!
