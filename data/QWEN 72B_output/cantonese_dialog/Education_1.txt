**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Wing, how's it going? We need to discuss the project on climate change for our environmental science class. Are you free now?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hey Mei, I good, thanks. Yes, I free. What you want to talk about?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I was thinking we could start by explaining the concept of the greenhouse effect. Do you understand it well?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, greenhouse effect... I know it important, but how to say... not very clear. Can you explain more?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! So, the greenhouse effect is when the Earth's atmosphere traps heat from the sun. Gases like carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere prevent heat from escaping into space. This is what keeps our planet warm and habitable.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I see. So, these gases make the Earth warm, like a blanket. But too much can cause problem, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! When there's too much of these gases, it leads to global warming, which can cause extreme weather, rising sea levels, and other environmental issues. 

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I understand. We need to write about this for our project?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, and we should also include examples of how human activities, like burning fossil fuels, contribute to the increase in these gases.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Right, burning things make more gases. How to say... factories, cars, and power plants. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, those are the main contributors. We can also mention some solutions, like using renewable energy and planting more trees.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Good idea. We can say wind, solar power, and also reforestation. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. And it would be great to include some statistics or graphs to support our points.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I can find some data online. Um, how to... make sure it reliable?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. We should use reputable sources like government websites or scientific journals.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I will check. We can meet again next week to go over the draft?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! Let's meet on Wednesday at the library. How's that?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Wednesday is fine. I will see you then. Thanks, Mei!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Wing. See you Wednesday! Bye!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bye, Mei! Take care!
