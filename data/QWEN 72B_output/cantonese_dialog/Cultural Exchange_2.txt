**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I’ve heard of it. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is... um, when people go to... how to say... cemetery to clean the tomb and pay respect to ancestor.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting. Do you go with your family?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I go with my family. We bring food, like fruit and paper money to burn. It is very important for us.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a really meaningful tradition. What kind of food do you usually bring?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, we bring fruit, like apples and oranges, and also some... some meat, like chicken. And, um, we bring incense to burn.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really nice. Do you have any special memories from this holiday?
