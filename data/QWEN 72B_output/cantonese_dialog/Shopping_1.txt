**Scene: Negotiating a price for an item at a local market.**

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I'm interested in this beautiful vase. Could you tell me how much it costs?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, hello! This one is very nice. Um, how to say... one hundred dollars.

**Speaker A (NS):** One hundred dollars, that's a bit steep. Could you maybe lower the price a little?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I can... give you special price. Ninety dollars, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ninety dollars is still a bit high for me. How about seventy-five dollars?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Seventy-five? That is... very low. But, okay, I can do eighty dollars. Is that fine?

**Speaker A (NS):** Eighty dollars is still a bit much. Can we meet in the middle, say seventy-eight dollars?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, seventy-eight... that is okay. But... how to say... I need to make little profit.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. How about seventy-seven dollars? That's a fair price, I think.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Seventy-seven... okay, I agree. You good customer.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you! I appreciate it. Would you mind wrapping it up for me?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No problem. I will wrap it for you. Wait a moment, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, take your time. Thanks a lot!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Here you go! It is all wrapped up. Enjoy your new vase.

**Speaker A (NS):** It looks perfect. Thank you again. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! Bye-bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care!
