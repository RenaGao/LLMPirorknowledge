**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Wing, I’m thinking about buying a new phone. Do you have any recommendations?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes. I can help you. What type of phone you like? Android or iPhone?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m not sure. What do you think are the main differences?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** iPhone is... um, it is very good for app store and... um, how to say... user interface. Android have more choice for brand and model.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true. What about battery life and camera quality?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** For battery, um, Android usually better. iPhone camera is very good, but now many Android phone also have good camera.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you have any specific models in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, for iPhone, iPhone 13 is popular. For Android, um, Samsung Galaxy S21 is good. And also, there is... um, Xiaomi, it is cheap and good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Xiaomi sounds interesting. What about durability and build quality?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Xiaomi is good. Many people say it is... um, strong and good for price. But iPhone and Samsung, they have better brand, so more trust.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. What about customer support?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** For customer support, um, iPhone is very good. They have many store and service. Samsung also have good support, but Xiaomi... um, not so much in some place.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you have any personal experience with these phones?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I use... um, I use Samsung. It is good for me. Very smooth and camera take good photo.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s helpful. Thank you, Wing. It sounds like Samsung might be a good choice for me.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think so. You can try it, and if you like, buy it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, I’ll check it out. Thanks a lot for your help!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You welcome. If you need more help, you can call me. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks again, Wing. See you later!
