**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Wing, how are you? I heard you're thinking about ways to stay healthy and active. Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hey Mei, I am good, thanks. Um, I think, I like to go for walk, but maybe, how to say... need more ideas.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great start! Walking is excellent. Have you tried any other activities like jogging or cycling?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I try jogging, but I find it tiring. Maybe, how about... um, swimming? My friend say it good for health.

**Speaker A (NS):** Swimming is a fantastic choice. It’s low-impact and works out your whole body. Plus, it feels refreshing!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like water. Maybe I go swimming more often. And, how to say... exercise at home, like yoga or... um, stretching?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yoga and stretching are great too! They help with flexibility and relaxation. Do you have a place at home where you can set up a small exercise area?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I have small room, yes. I can use mat and... um, video, online for follow.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! There are lots of online tutorials that can guide you through different exercises. Eating well is also important. Have you been focusing on a healthy diet?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I try eat more fruits and vegetables. I cook at home, um, healthy food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Cooking at home is a great way to control what you eat. Do you have any favorite healthy recipes you’d like to share?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like make stir-fry with chicken and vegetables. It is fast and taste good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Stir-fry is delicious and easy to make! It’s a good way to get a variety of nutrients. How about setting a weekly goal to try a new activity or recipe?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Good idea! I can try new thing every week. Maybe, how to say... keep a diary to track progress.

**Speaker A (NS):** Keeping a diary is a great idea. It helps you stay motivated and see your progress over time. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** It sound good. I will start this week.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! I’m excited to hear how it goes. Let’s catch up next week and see what new things you’ve tried.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will tell you. Goodbye, Mei, take care!

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Wing! See you soon!
