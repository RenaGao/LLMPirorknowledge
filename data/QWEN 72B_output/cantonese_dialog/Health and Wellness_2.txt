**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Thanks for coming today. My name is Alex, and I’ll be your trainer. Can you tell me a bit about yourself and your fitness goals?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello, I am Wing. Nice to meet you. I want... um, to be more healthy and... fit. I work in office, so I sit too much. I want to exercise more.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great goal, Wing! What kind of exercises do you currently do?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I sometimes go... go to gym, but not often. I try to walk more, but it is... difficult to keep.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. How about your diet? Do you have any specific dietary habits or preferences?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I try to eat... um, healthy food. I cook at home, but sometimes I eat out. I want to eat more vegetables and less... less junk food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start. What are your main fitness goals? Do you want to lose weight, build muscle, or just improve overall health?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I want to lose a little weight and... um, be more strong. I want to feel better and have more energy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Makes sense. How many days a week can you commit to working out?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I think... three times a week. I can go to gym on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. For those days, we can focus on a mix of cardio and strength training. What do you think of starting with a 30-minute session of cardio, like jogging or cycling, followed by some weight training?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sounds good. I like jogging. Um, how long should I do weight training?

**Speaker A (NS):** About 20 minutes should be fine. We can start with some basic exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups. As you get more comfortable, we can add more variety.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I can do that. And on other days, what should I do?

**Speaker A (NS):** On your off days, try to stay active. You can go for a walk, do some stretching, or even some light yoga. This will help you stay flexible and prevent injury.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Good idea. I will try to do that. Um, how to track my progress?

**Speaker A (NS):** We can use a fitness app to track your workouts and weight. You can also take photos to see visual changes. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think that’s helpful. I will start using app.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s set a goal to check in every two weeks to see how you’re doing. Any questions so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I think I understand. Thank you for your help, Alex.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Wing! I’m excited to help you reach your goals. See you on Monday for our first session!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you on Monday! Thanks again.
