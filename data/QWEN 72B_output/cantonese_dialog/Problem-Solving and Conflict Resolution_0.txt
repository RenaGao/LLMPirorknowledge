**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Mei! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I am... um, good. Thanks. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking. I wanted to talk to you about something that’s been on my mind. Is that okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, of course. What is it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I felt a bit hurt when you didn’t include me in the plans for the beach on Saturday. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I... I am sorry. I no mean to, um... exclude you. I just think, um, Wing and I, we plan it suddenly.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand that, but it would have been nice to be included. We’re good friends, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, of course, we are good friends. I should have asked you. I feel bad.

**Speaker A (NS):** I appreciate that. I just want to make sure we’re on the same page. What do you think about our plans for next weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Next weekend? How to say... maybe we can go hiking? I like hiking, and it is good exercise.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great idea! We can invite Wing too, if you want.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, good idea. I will ask him. And also, um, we can have picnic, you know, bring some food and drinks.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let’s plan it together. What day works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, how about Sunday? I think Sunday is better, because I have work on Saturday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sunday works for me too. What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Let’s say, um, ten o’clock? Nine is too early, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten o’clock sounds good. We can start early and enjoy the whole day.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I agree. I will, um, text Wing and confirm with him.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll see you then. Thanks for talking this out with me, Mei.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No problem, thank you too. I am glad we fix this. See you Sunday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you Sunday! Have a good day, Mei.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too, bye!
