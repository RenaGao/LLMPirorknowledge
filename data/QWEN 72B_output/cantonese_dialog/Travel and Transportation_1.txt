**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can you help me? I'm trying to find the nearest hotel.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, sure! Sure, no problem. Which hotel you want to go?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm looking for the Ocean View Hotel. Do you know where it is?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yeah, I know. It is... um, how to say... a bit far from here, but not too far. You go straight this road for about... um, ten minutes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so I just keep going straight for ten minutes?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, straight. Then, you turn left at the big roundabout. There is a big roundabout, you see?

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. I turn left at the roundabout. What after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** After roundabout, you go straight again. You will see a big sign say "Ocean View Hotel." It is on your right side.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, a big sign on the right side after the roundabout. That sounds clear. Thanks a lot!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You are welcome. It is not difficult. If you get lost, you can ask local people. We are very friendly.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s reassuring. I appreciate the help. How long should it take me to get there by foot?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** By foot, maybe twenty minutes. If you walk fast, maybe fifteen. But it is nice weather today, so you can enjoy walk.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good. I might walk and enjoy the scenery. One last thing—should I be careful of anything along the way?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, no. It is safe. Just be careful of cars when you cross the road. The traffic can be a bit busy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Understood. I’ll be careful. Thank you so much for your help!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No problem! Hope you have good time. Enjoy your stay at Ocean View Hotel!

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks again! Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! Bye-bye!
