**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Wing! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi, Mei! I am good, thanks. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. So, we need to discuss the project deadlines and tasks. When do you think we should aim to finish the first phase?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I think... maybe end of this month? But, you know, we have a lot of things to do, so maybe a little bit later, like... next week?

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Let’s aim for the end of this month, but we can adjust if we need to. What tasks are you working on right now?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I am working on the... um, report. And also, I need to check the data, you know, make sure everything is correct.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great. Do you need any help with the data checking? I can assist if you’re feeling overwhelmed.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, no, I can do it. But, if it is really hard, I will ask for help. Thank you, Mei.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, Wing. Let’s also set a check-in point for next week to see how we’re progressing. What day works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, how about Wednesday? Or Thursday is okay too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wednesday sounds good. Let’s meet at 2 p.m. in the conference room.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** 2 p.m. Sounds good. I will... um, prepare some notes to bring.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. And let’s also make sure to update the project timeline on the shared document. That way, we’re both on the same page.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I will do that. I think it is important to keep everything organized.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. By the way, do you have any other tasks that might affect our timeline?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, I don’t think so. I just have the report and data to finish. But, if something comes up, I will let you know.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Thanks for keeping me informed. We’re making good progress.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I hope so. Thank you, Mei.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. See you on Wednesday at 2 p.m.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you then. Goodbye, Mei.

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Wing. Have a good day!
