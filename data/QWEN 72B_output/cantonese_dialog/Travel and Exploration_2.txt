**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! It’s nice to meet you. I’m here for the first time and I’m a bit lost. Could you help me find the way to the historical museum?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, yes, of course! I can help you. The historical museum is... um... near the main square. You go this way, turn left, and then go straight for about five minutes. You will see big building with old style.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thank you! Is it a big building? I might have trouble finding it if it’s small.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No, it is very big. You cannot miss it. Um, how to say... it is landmark of the town. Many people go there.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s helpful. Are there any other landmarks or interesting places I should see while I’m here?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, there is park nearby. It is very nice, have many trees and flowers. Um... and also, there is old church, very beautiful. You should see.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds lovely! Is the park close to the museum?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it is. You go out from the museum, turn right, and walk for about three minutes. You will see big green area.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And the church, is it in the park or nearby?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Church is near park, but not inside. You go from park, turn left, and walk for another five minutes. You will see big, old building with tower.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. The big, old building with a tower. I’ll make sure to check it out. Thank you so much for your help!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You are welcome! I hope you enjoy your visit. If you need more help, just ask. I am happy to help.

**Speaker A (NS):** I really appreciate it. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too! See you around. Bye-bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Thank you again!
