**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Wing, how are you? I was thinking about planning a trip to a new city with our friends this weekend. Any ideas where we could go?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello! I am fine. Um, how to say... I think going to a new city is good. Maybe... um, how to say... a place with nice beach and food?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! Have you been to any cities recently that you liked?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I go to... um, Hong Kong last summer. It have very nice beach and yummy food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Hong Kong is a fantastic choice! It has a lot to offer. What activities do you suggest we do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We can go shopping, eat in nice restaurant, and visit... um, how to say... big building, like Victoria Peak.

**Speaker A (NS):** Victoria Peak is a must-see! What about transportation? Do you know how we can get there?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we can take MTR, it is subway, and also we can take bus. It is easy to go everywhere.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! How about accommodations? Any suggestions for where we should stay?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We can stay in hotel near the beach. It is more fun, I think. And also, it close to many restaurants.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a plan! When should we start our trip? What day works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, how about Friday afternoon? We can start early and have more time to enjoy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Friday afternoon works well for me. What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Let’s meet at... um, how to say... train station at three o’clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Three o’clock at the train station sounds good. Should we pack any specific things?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, we need to bring swimsuit, sunscreen, and light clothes. And also, ID card and money.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll send a message to the others to confirm everything. Thanks for the suggestions, Wing!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You welcome! I am excited. See you on Friday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you on Friday! Have a great day, Wing!
