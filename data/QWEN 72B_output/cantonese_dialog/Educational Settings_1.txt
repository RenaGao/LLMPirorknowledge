**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Mei! How’s it going? Are you ready for the upcoming test?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hey, Sarah! Ah, how to say... I have a bit nervous. Test is important, you know.

**Speaker A (NS):** I completely understand. It’s totally normal to feel that way. Have you started studying yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I start a little bit. I read textbook and make some notes. But I think I need more help.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start! What do you think is the hardest part of the test for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, the hardest part is... um, the problem-solving questions. I always... how to say... stuck.

**Speaker A (NS):** Stuck, that’s a good word! Do you want to go over those questions together? Maybe we can practice a few examples.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think it very good idea. We can meet before test, like tomorrow?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, tomorrow works for me. What time is good for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I finish class at 4 p.m. So, 5 p.m. is good, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** 5 p.m. sounds perfect. Where do you want to meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** How about the library? It is quiet and have many study room.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! The library is a perfect place to study. Do you have any specific topics you want to cover?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think... um, the chapter about functions and graphs. And also, some practice exams.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. We can definitely focus on those areas. I’ll bring my notes and some practice problems.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you so much, Sarah. I really appreciate your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all, Mei. We’ll do great together. See you tomorrow at 5 p.m. at the library!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, see you then! Thank you again. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Mei! Take care!
