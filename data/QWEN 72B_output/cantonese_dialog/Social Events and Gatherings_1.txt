**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Mei! How are you? We’re planning a surprise party for Jason this weekend. Do you want to join us?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi! I am good, thanks. Yes, I want to join. What we do for party?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We’re thinking of having it at my place. We need to figure out some activities and decorations. What do you think we should do?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, how to say... We can have some games, like, um... charades, and also music. And... decorations, we can use balloons and streamers.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those are good ideas! We can definitely have charades and some music. Do you have any favorite party games?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I like, um... spin the bottle, and also, truth or dare. These fun games.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds fun! Spin the bottle and truth or dare can be a great addition. We should also think about the food. Any suggestions?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I can bring, um... some snacks, like chips and popcorn. And maybe we can make some, um... finger food, like sandwiches.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect! We can also order some pizza. When should we start setting up?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We can start early, maybe, um... three o'clock. That way, everything ready before Jason come.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good plan. We can start at 3 p.m. and have the party start at 5 p.m. We should also make sure to keep it a secret. Can you help with that?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I can, um... tell Jason we go to cinema, but we actually come to your place. He will be surprised!

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! That’s a great cover story. We’ll make sure to text each other to coordinate everything.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yeah, we text each other. I think it will be really fun surprise for Jason.

**Speaker A (NS):** It will be! Thanks for your help, Mei. See you at 3 p.m. this Saturday?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, see you then. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Mei! See you at the party!
