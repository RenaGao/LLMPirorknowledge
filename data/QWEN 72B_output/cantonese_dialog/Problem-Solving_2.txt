**Scene: Mei and Wing are discussing a mistake Mei made in a recent group project and how to resolve it.**

**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Wing, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I wanted to talk to you about the group project we did last week. I think I made a mistake.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, really? What kind of mistake?

**Speaker A (NS):** I accidentally used the wrong data set for the analysis. It might have affected our results.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh no, that is... um, how to say... not good. But, it is okay. Mistake happen.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, Wing. I appreciate your understanding. I was thinking we could re-run the analysis with the correct data. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think that is good idea. We can check the result again and make sure it is right.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. I’ll start working on it right away. I’ll also send the updated results to the rest of the team.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, maybe we can... how to say... double-check each other’s work to avoid mistake in the future?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a fantastic idea. It’s always good to have a second pair of eyes. Thanks for the suggestion.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No problem. I happy to help. We can do this together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Let’s plan to meet tomorrow afternoon to go over the new results. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I think that is good. Afternoon is okay for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s say 2 p.m. in the library?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** 2 p.m. in the library, yes. See you then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, see you then. Thanks again for your understanding, Wing.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** No worries. See you tomorrow. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Wing. Take care!
