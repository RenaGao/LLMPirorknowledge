**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Wing, how are you? Want to plan a birthday surprise for Mei this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I am good, thank you. Yes, I think... um, we can do something fun for Mei.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, we can go to the beach. She like beach... um, how to say... it is relaxing for her.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good idea! What else can we do at the beach?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We can swim, and also, um... sit in the sun. Maybe we can have a picnic too.

**Speaker A (NS):** A picnic sounds nice. What kind of food should we bring?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, some sandwiches, fruits, and also, um... drinks. Maybe some cake too, because it is birthday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! We can also decorate the beach area a bit. Do you think we should bring some balloons and streamers?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that is good. We can also, um... make a banner. It say "Happy Birthday Mei."

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! When should we meet to set everything up?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, how about... ten o'clock? It is not too early, but we have enough time to prepare.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten o'clock sounds perfect. Where should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We can meet at the... um, how to say... bus stop near the beach.

**Speaker A (NS):** The bus stop near the beach, got it. What other things do we need to bring?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** We need... um, towel, sunscreen, and also, um... beach umbrella. Maybe some games too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good list! How about a frisbee or a beach ball?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! Beach ball is good. It is fun to play.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! We should also make sure everyone in the group knows about the plan. Do you want to send out a message?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I can do that. I will send message to everyone. Um, what to say?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about: "Hey everyone, let's meet at the bus stop near the beach at 10 a.m. for Mei's birthday surprise!"

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Okay, I will write that. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Everything sounds great. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, see you Saturday! Thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Wing! Bye!
