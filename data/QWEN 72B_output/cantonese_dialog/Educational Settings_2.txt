**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I am good, thank you. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. So, we're planning to meet our study group this weekend. Do you have time on Saturday?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I have time. You want do what?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could go over that challenging topic from our last class. You know, the one about climate change and its impacts.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, climate change, yes. That is difficult topic. Good idea. Where we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about the library? It's quiet, and we'll have access to books and resources.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Library is good. What time we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** What about 3 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Three p.m., okay. But, um, how to say... that quite late for me. Can we meet earlier?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, how about 1 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** One p.m., that is better. We need bring what?

**Speaker A (NS):** Bring your notes and any questions you have. I'll bring some articles and graphs to help explain the topic.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Good, I bring my notes. Um, how to explain... I have some idea, but not sure if right.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's totally fine. We can discuss and figure it out together. It's all about learning.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, thank you. I feel more comfortable now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, we'll meet at the library at 1 p.m. on Saturday?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, 1 p.m., library. See you then.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a good day, Wing.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** You too, thank you!
