**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hello, Alex. I have... have a problem with a thing I buy. Um, how to say... a electronic device.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, can you tell me more about the issue with the electronic device?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, it is... a, a Bluetooth speaker. I buy it last week. But... it, it not work properly.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Can you describe what happens when you try to use it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes. When I connect my phone, it... um, it not play music. I try many time, but no sound.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Have you checked the battery to make sure it’s fully charged?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I check. Battery is full. I even try with new... um, new batteries, but still no sound.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, thank you for letting me know. Have you looked at the user manual to see if there are any troubleshooting tips?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I look, but I not find anything helpful. It just say to connect and play, but it not work.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Let’s try a few things to diagnose the issue. First, can you reset the Bluetooth speaker by holding the power button for 10 seconds?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hold the power button? Okay, I try. (Pause) I try, but it still not work.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s try one more thing. Can you try connecting it to a different device, like a tablet or a laptop?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ah, I see. I try with my tablet... (Pause) No, it still not work.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It seems like the issue might be with the speaker itself. We can arrange for a replacement. Can you provide me with the order number and the model of the speaker?
