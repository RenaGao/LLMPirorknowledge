**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Wing! How are you? Are you free this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hey Mei! I am good, thank you. Yes, I am free. What you want do?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I was thinking about going on a group trip. Any ideas where we can go?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um... how to say... the beach? I hear the weather is very good now.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a fantastic idea! The beach sounds perfect. What activities you want to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I like swim and sunbathe. We also can eat some... um... snacks?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we can definitely do that! Maybe we can try some local seafood too. What time you want to meet on Saturday?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Ten o'clock is good, I think. Too early, we will be... um... very tired.

**Speaker A (NS):** I agree. Ten o'clock is perfect. Starting early will be cooler, especially for the beach.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, very good. I just buy new swimsuit. It is very... um... nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome! I can’t wait to see it. Do we need to bring anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bring sunscreen, towel, and... um... water bottle. And maybe some... um... games?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! We can play some beach games. What about frisbee or volleyball?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, frisbee is fun. Volleyball is good too. We all like play.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! So, we meet at the beach at 10 a.m. on Saturday. Bring sunscreen, towel, water bottle, and a frisbee or volleyball.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I remember. See you then! Thank you for invite me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! I’m looking forward to it. See you Saturday! Bye!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Bye! See you!
