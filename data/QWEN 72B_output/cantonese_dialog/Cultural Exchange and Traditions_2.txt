**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Wing! How are you doing? I heard you have some great ideas for a cultural event. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hey, Mei, I am good, thanks. Um, I think I want to organize a Cantonese food festival. How to say... a gathering where people can try different Cantonese dishes and learn about our culture.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! What kind of dishes do you have in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I want to have... dim sum, of course. And, uh, roast goose, and... how to say... that special rice with sausage and chicken?

**Speaker A (NS):** You mean congee with lap cheong and chicken?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, yes! Congee with lap cheong and chicken. And maybe some desserts like egg tarts and mango pudding.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yum, that all sounds delicious! What about activities or performances to go along with the food?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, I think we can have some traditional lion dance performances. And, um, maybe some Cantonese opera singers. Also, we can set up a stall where people can learn to write Chinese calligraphy.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! It really adds to the cultural experience. Do you have a venue in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** I was thinking maybe the community center downtown. It is big enough for all the stalls and performances.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! How about the date? When do you want to hold the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, I think next month, in November, would be good. It is not too cold, and people are free from holidays.

**Speaker A (NS):** That works! What about volunteers? Do you need help with organizing?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, I need volunteers for cooking, setting up stalls, and helping with the performances. I will post on social media to find more people.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great plan! I can help with the social media posts and maybe even cook some dishes.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Thank you so much, Mei! You are very kind.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all! I’m excited to be a part of it. Let’s meet next week to go over the details?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sure, how about Wednesday? We can meet at my place.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wednesday works for me. See you then!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** See you Wednesday! Thank you again. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Wing! Can’t wait to see you!
