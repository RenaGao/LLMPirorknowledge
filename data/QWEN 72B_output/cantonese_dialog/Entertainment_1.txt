**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Wing, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hi Mei, I am good, thank you. I have think about weekend plan already. You have idea?

**Speaker A (NS):** Actually, I was thinking we could go out for dinner and maybe do something fun after. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Oh, dinner sound good. We can go to new restaurant, um, I hear about one... how to say... Italian food. It is near my place.

**Speaker A (NS):** Italian restaurant? That sounds great! Do you have a specific one in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, it call "Trattoria Bella." I read review, it is very good. We can try it. And after, maybe we go see movie?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great suggestion! Do you have any movie in mind, or should we decide later?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Um, we can see new action movie. I like action, you like?

**Speaker A (NS):** I do enjoy action movies, so that’s perfect. What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Let see... restaurant open at 6, so we can meet at 5:30? It give us time to find parking.

**Speaker A (NS):** 5:30 sounds good. It will give us plenty of time. And then we can grab some dessert after the movie if we want.

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Hmm, dessert sound nice. Maybe we can go to ice cream place near cinema.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! So, to summarize, we’ll meet at 5:30, go to Trattoria Bella for dinner, see an action movie, and grab ice cream after. Does that sound right?

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Yes, that is right. I look forward to it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! It’s going to be a lot of fun. See you at 5:30, Wing!

**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese):** Sure, see you then. Bye, Mei!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Wing! Have a good day!
