**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo, how are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, I am good. Thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks for asking. So, Jisoo, I was wondering, what's your favorite holiday in Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, my favorite holiday... that is Seollal. Seollal is Korean New Year. It is very important holiday.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sure. Um... Seollal, we go to our family house. We wear traditional clothes, hanbok. We do many things, like praying for ancestors and playing games.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's really cool! Do you have any special foods you eat during Seollal?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we eat tteokguk. Tteokguk is rice cake soup. It is very tasty. And also, we have jeon, which is like pancake.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, I'd love to try tteokguk someday! What about presents? Do people exchange gifts during Seollal?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we give money called sebaetdon to children. It is tradition. Children say special blessing words to get money.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a wonderful tradition! How do you usually spend the day with your family?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We usually have big family gathering. We cook together, eat, and talk. It is very warm and nice time.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a really special time. Do you have any other traditions during Seollal?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we play traditional games like yutnori. It is fun game with sticks. And we watch TV shows together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yutnori sounds fun! I'd love to try it sometime. Thanks for sharing all this, Jisoo. It's really interesting to learn about Seollal.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You are welcome. I am happy to share. Maybe next time, you can come and experience it!

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be amazing! Thanks again, Jisoo. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too. Take care!
