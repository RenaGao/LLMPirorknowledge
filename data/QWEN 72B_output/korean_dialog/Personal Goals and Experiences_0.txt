**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks for asking! So, what are your goals for the next year?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... my goal is... I want to improve my English, and also, I want to travel... more places.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! Why do you want to improve your English?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Because, um... I think it is very important for my job. And also, I want to read more books and watch movies without subtitle.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! What steps are you taking to achieve this goal?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I am taking English class... um, online class. And I try to practice with... how to say... language partner.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good plan! How often do you meet with your language partner?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I meet... um, once week. We talk about... um, different topics. It is very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! And what about your travel goal? Any specific places in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I want to go to Japan and... um, maybe Thailand. I like to explore new culture and try new food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! Do you have a specific time in mind when you want to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I want to go... um, during summer. When the weather is nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect timing! Have you started planning your trip yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I am researching... um, places to stay and things to do. I think I will book my ticket soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good idea. It sounds like you have a clear plan for both your language learning and travel goals. Good luck with everything!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! I will. Um... how to say... it is nice talking with you.

**Speaker A (NS):** It was nice talking with you too, Minji! Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Bye!
