**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo! How are you? Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi! I am good, thank you. Um, no plans yet. Why you ask?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could plan a trip to a new city with our friends. Maybe somewhere close but exciting!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, that sounds fun! Um, any idea where we can go?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking about visiting Busan. It’s known for its beautiful beaches and delicious seafood.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Busan? I heard it is nice. When we can go?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this weekend? It’s a short trip, and we can make it a two-day thing.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Two day trip? Yes, I think that good. What we do there?

**Speaker A (NS):** We could start with a visit to Haeundae Beach, go shopping, and then try some local seafood restaurants.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, shopping and beach... I like. And... how to say... seafood is good too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What about everyone else? Do you want to invite anyone?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I can ask Minji and Seung. They also like beach and food. I will send them message.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And we should plan our transportation. Do you want to take the train or drive?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Train, I think. It is easy and... um, cheap. And we not worry about parking.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, the train is a great choice. We can look at the schedules together.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we check together. And um, when we meet to start our trip?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about we meet at the train station on Saturday morning at 9 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Nine a.m.? Yes, that is good. I will tell Minji and Seung.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! Let’s confirm with everyone and finalize the details.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I will send message now. Um, see you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! See you on the trip, Jisoo! Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Bye!
