**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Jisoo! Thanks for meeting with me today. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, we need to discuss the project deadline. Do you have any ideas on how we can meet it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes, I think we need to divide work. Can we... how to say... separate tasks?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great idea. We can break down the project into smaller parts. What parts do you think you can handle?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I can do, um, data collection and some, how to say... data analysis. I am good at that.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I can take care of the report writing and the final presentation. When can we start?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** How about we start tomorrow? We need to finish by this Friday, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Let's meet tomorrow at 10 a.m. to go over the details. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, 10 a.m. is fine. Um, should we also, how to say... check progress every day?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good point. Let's have a quick daily check-in to make sure we're on track. How about 3 p.m. each day?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, 3 p.m. is good. We can, um, send updates and discuss any problems.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Let's also set a time to review everything on Thursday afternoon.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, Thursday afternoon. We can finalize everything then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'll send you a calendar invite for all our meetings. Is there anything else we need to discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think that is all. We have clear plan, so we should be good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I appreciate your help, Jisoo. Let's nail this project!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I am excited. Thank you for working with me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! See you tomorrow at 10.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** See you then. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Jisoo!
