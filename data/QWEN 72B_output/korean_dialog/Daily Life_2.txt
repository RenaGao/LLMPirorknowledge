**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jisoo! How are you settling in with the new place?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, Minji! Um, I good. Thanks for asking. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I was thinking, since we’re going to be living together, why don’t you tell me about your favorite meal and how you prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, favorite meal... um, I like Korean food. You know, bulgogi. It is... beef with sweet and spicy sauce.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! How do you make it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, first, I buy... how to say... thin slice of beef. And also, I need... um, vegetables. Onion, garlic, and a little bit of carrot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. What about the sauce? What ingredients do you use?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** For sauce, I use soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil. And... um, pepper and ginger. Mix them together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great mix! Do you have to marinate the beef?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I marinate beef for, um, one hour. It make beef more tasty.

**Speaker A (NS):** Makes sense. What do you do next?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** After marinate, I cook beef in pan. I put little oil, then add beef and vegetables. Stir them together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a lot of stir-frying. Do you serve it with rice?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, always serve with rice. And sometimes, um, kimchi on side.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect! I’d love to try it sometime. How about we cook it together this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes! It will be fun. I cook, and you help me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! I’m looking forward to it. What time should we start?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Let’s say, um, five o’clock. Is that okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Five o’clock works for me. See you then!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** See you then. Thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Have a great day, Jisoo!
