**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo, what are you up to this evening?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, hi! Not much, just thinking about... um, how to say... chilling at home. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds nice, but I was actually thinking of going out tonight. Want to join me?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, sure! Where you want to go?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, there’s this new Italian restaurant I’ve been wanting to try. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Italian? I love Italian food! But, um, I heard they also have good Korean food at the market. Maybe we can go there?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea too! How about we split the difference and try a fusion place? They have both Italian and Korean dishes.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Fusion place? That sounds interesting! But are they expensive?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not too bad. I think it’s pretty reasonable. Plus, they have a happy hour special that starts soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Happy hour? What is that?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s a time where they offer discounts on food and drinks. It’s usually a good deal.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I see. That’s good. What time happy hour start?

**Speaker A (NS):** It usually starts around 5 PM and goes until 7 PM. We could grab a bite and then maybe do something fun afterward.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Like what? We can go to karaoke or, um, how to say... bowling?

**Speaker A (NS):** Karaoke sounds fun! We can sing some Korean songs if you want. And bowling is a great idea too.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, let’s do karaoke first and then bowling. That will be so much fun!

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let’s meet at the restaurant at 5 PM, and then we can head to the karaoke place.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sounds good! I’ll be there. See you then!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Have a good evening, Jisoo. See you at 5!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! See you then!
