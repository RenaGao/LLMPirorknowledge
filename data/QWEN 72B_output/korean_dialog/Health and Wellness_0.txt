**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, how are you today? I’m Dr. Smith, and I’ll be your doctor today.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hello, Dr. Smith. I am Minji. Nice to meet you. I not feel good today.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I have... uh... head... headache. And I have fever, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** How long have you had the headache and fever?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I have it for three day. And my body is... um... how to say... very achy.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Do you have any other symptoms? Like a cough or a sore throat?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I have little cough. But no sore throat. I just feel... um... tired all time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s understandable. Have you had any trouble sleeping or eating?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I not sleep good. And I not eat much. I have no appetite.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, thank you for letting me know. Have you taken any medications or tried anything to feel better?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I take aspirin for headache. But it not help much.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. We’ll need to do a few tests to figure out what’s causing your symptoms. I’ll also prescribe some medication to help with your fever and headache.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, thank you, Dr. Smith. I hope I feel better soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** I hope so too. We’ll get you feeling better in no time. Is there anything else you’d like to add or ask?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I think that’s all. Thank you for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Minji. Take care, and I’ll see you in a few days for a follow-up.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. Goodbye, Dr. Smith.

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Minji. Take care.
