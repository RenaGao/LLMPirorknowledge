**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I noticed you had a question about the homework. What do you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I have question about homework. Um... how to say... the problem number three. I don't understand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. What specifically is confusing you about problem number three?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... the part where it say... it say "calculate the area of the triangle using the given formula." I not sure how to use the formula.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's look at it together. The formula to find the area of a triangle is A equals one-half base times height. Do you see where these values are given in the problem?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I see. It say base is 10 and height is 8. But I not sure... how to put it in formula.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. You just need to plug in the numbers. So, A equals one-half times 10 times 8. Can you try to calculate that?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, let me see... one-half times 10 is 5, and 5 times 8 is... 40. So, the area is 40?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's correct! The area of the triangle is 40 square units. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it make sense now. Thank you for helping me.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Is there anything else you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I think I understand now. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'm glad I could help. Have a good day, Jisoo!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too. Goodbye!
