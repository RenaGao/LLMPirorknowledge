**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Are you looking to buy something today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, um... hi. I want to buy this... um, how to say... this thing. It is nice. [Pointing to a handmade lamp]

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you’re interested in the handmade lamp? It’s a beautiful piece, isn’t it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it is very... um, beautiful. I like it. But, um, I think... the price is a little... how to say... high.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. The lamp is handcrafted, so it’s a bit more expensive. But I can give you a special price. How about $50?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Fifty... um, dollars. I see. Can you... um, make it a little lower? Maybe... um, thirty-five dollars?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let me think about that. Thirty-five dollars is quite a bit lower than the regular price. How about we meet in the middle at $40?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, forty dollars... I... I can... how to say... I can agree to that. It is fair.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’m glad we could agree. Do you need a bag for it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, please. Can I have... um... one bag?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, no problem. Here you go. Is there anything else you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I think... um, this is all. Thank you... um... very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re very welcome! Have a great day, and thanks for your purchase.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care!
