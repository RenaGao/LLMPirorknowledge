**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking! I was wondering, could you tell me about some dining etiquette in Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. Um, in Korea, we have many rules for eating. For example, we wait until oldest person start eating.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting! Do you use chopsticks and spoons?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we use chopsticks and spoon. But we not put them together on table. It is, how to say... bad luck.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. What about pouring drinks?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, when pour drink, we use two hand. And we not pour own drink. We pour for other and they pour for you.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really respectful. Do you have any specific rules for sitting at the table?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we sit oldest person at head of table. And we not put feet on chair or table. It is not polite.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. In the U.S., we also have some etiquette rules. For example, we usually use forks and knives, and we sit when we eat.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I know. We also use fork in Korea, but not as much as spoon and chopsticks.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right. And in the U.S., it’s considered rude to talk with your mouth full.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. In Korea, we also think it is not good. But we more relaxed about it in family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Another thing, we often leave a little bit of food on our plate to show we’ve had enough.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** In Korea, we try to finish all food on plate. It show respect for food and person who cook.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great point! It’s really important to be mindful of these differences when dining with people from different cultures.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I agree. It is good to learn and respect other culture’s customs.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Thanks for sharing all this, Jisoo! It’s been really interesting.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You are welcome! I happy to talk about it. See you next time!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you soon! Have a great day!
