**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, Jisoo, have you read any good books lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, not really. I usually read Korean books, but I want to try something new. Do you have any recommendation?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! I would recommend "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee. It’s a classic and really insightful.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I heard about it. Why you recommend this book?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, it’s a powerful story about racial injustice and the importance of empathy. It’s also very well-written and has some really memorable characters.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** That sounds interesting. I like book about... um, how to say... society and people.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! It explores a lot of important social issues and human relationships. It’s a great read for anyone interested in those topics.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I see. Can I ask, is it easy to understand? I am not very good at reading English literature.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s a bit challenging at times, but the language is pretty accessible. I think you can handle it. Plus, there are many resources online that can help you with the harder parts.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, that sounds good. I will try to read it. Thank you for recommendation.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I think you’ll enjoy it. Let me know what you think after you finish it.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. Um, do you have other books you can recommend for practice?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! You might also like "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen. It’s a bit more romantic but just as insightful.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I heard about that one too. Maybe I will try that one next. Thank you so much!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Jisoo. It was great talking to you. I hope you enjoy the books!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, I hope so too. Take care, and see you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Jisoo. Goodbye!
