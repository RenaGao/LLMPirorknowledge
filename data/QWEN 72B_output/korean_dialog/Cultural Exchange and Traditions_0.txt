**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, I am good. Um, just studying for exam. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing okay. I was thinking, do you have any traditions or festivals from Korea that you'd like to share with me?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes! There is one I really like. It is called Seollal. It is Korean New Year.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! Can you tell me more about Seollal?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sure. Seollal is in January or February. It depend on lunar calendar. We have big family gathering, you know.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. What do you do during this family gathering?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, we do many thing. First, we perform ancestral ritual. It is, how to say... pay respect to our ancestors.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. That's a beautiful tradition. What else do you do?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We wear special clothes called hanbok. It is very colorful and pretty. And, we eat special food. One is tteokguk. It is soup with rice cake.

**Speaker A (NS):** Tteokguk sounds delicious! Do you have a favorite dish during Seollal?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I very like tteokguk. It is, um, have a good meaning. Eat tteokguk, you become one year older.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a fun tradition! What other activities do you do?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We play traditional game like yutnori. It is, um, board game. And, we do some, how to say... fun thing, like singing and dancing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yutnori sounds like a lot of fun. Do you play it with your family?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we play it. Everyone join. It very good time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great way to bond with family. Is there anything special you do at the end of Seollal?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, we do, how to say... gift giving. We give money to children. It is called seo money.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you mean "sebae" money?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, sebae money. Children bow to elder and receive money.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's such a meaningful tradition. Do you miss celebrating Seollal here?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, sometimes. But, I try to do some thing same. Like wear hanbok and eat tteokguk.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great way to keep the tradition alive. Do you want to do something similar together sometime?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. I would like that. We can, um, try some Korean food and maybe wear hanbok.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect! Let's plan it for next weekend. How does that sound?
