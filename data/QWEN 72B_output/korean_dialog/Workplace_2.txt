**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo, thanks for coming by today. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I wanted to go over the upcoming project with you. We’re working on a new marketing campaign. Do you have a moment to discuss it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I have time. What is... um, campaign about?

**Speaker A (NS):** It's about promoting our new product, the Smart Home Hub. We need to create a series of social media posts and a video ad. What do you think about that?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sounds good. How to... um, how to start?

**Speaker A (NS):** First, we need to brainstorm some ideas for the social media posts. We can look at what our competitors are doing and come up with unique angles. Then, we’ll draft the content and get it approved by the marketing team. What do you think about that process?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is clear. Um, for video ad, we need to... um, plan script and... um, how to say... filming schedule?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We’ll write the script, plan the shooting schedule, and coordinate with the video production team. We’ll also need to decide on the actors and locations. Do you have any ideas for locations or actors?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** For actors, we can use... um, influencer who have many followers. And for location, maybe... um, modern home, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great ideas! Using an influencer with a large following will definitely help. A modern home setting will make the product look appealing. We’ll put together a proposal and send it to the team for feedback. Does that sound good to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, sounds good. When we need to finish this?

**Speaker A (NS):** The initial proposal should be ready by next Friday. Then, we’ll have a meeting to discuss the feedback and make any necessary adjustments. How does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh, it is okay. I will work hard to finish on time.

**Speaker A (NS):** I appreciate your effort, Jisoo. If you have any questions or need help, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re a team, and we’re here to support each other.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I will try my best.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s touch base next week to see how things are going. Have a good day, Jisoo!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too. See you next week!
