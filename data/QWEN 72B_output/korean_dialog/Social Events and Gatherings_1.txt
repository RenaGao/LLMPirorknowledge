**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Minji! How are you today?

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Hi! I’m good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I have a fun idea for the weekend. What do you think about planning a surprise party for Jisoo?

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Oh, that sounds nice! Jisoo will be happy. When we do it?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this Saturday? It’s Jisoo’s birthday, and we can really make it special.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Um, Saturday... that good. Where we have the party?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could have it at my place. It’s big enough for everyone, and we can decorate it too.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Yes, that sounds good. What time we start?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s start around 7 PM. That way, everyone can come after work or school.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** 7 PM, okay. Um... what we need to do? Food, decorations, and...?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! We can order some pizza and maybe make a cake. For decorations, we can buy balloons and streamers. And don’t forget a birthday card!

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes, card. I can make one. And who we invite?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s invite our close friends from school and maybe some of Jisoo’s other friends too. We should probably send out invitations by email or text.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Yes, that good. I can help with the invitations. What we tell Jisoo?

**Speaker A (NS):** We should keep it a surprise. Maybe tell her we’re all going out for dinner or something. That way, she won’t suspect anything.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Yes, that smart. Um, what about music?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! We can make a playlist with Jisoo’s favorite songs. That will make the party even more fun.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Yes, playlist, that good. I will help with that too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s meet on Friday to finalize the plans. We can go over everything and make sure we’re all set.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Yes, Friday... how about 5 PM?

**Speaker A (NS):** 5 PM works for me. See you then!

**Minji (L2, Korean):** See you then. Thanks for planning this! Jisoo will be so happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Can’t wait to see the look on her face. Have a good day, Minji!

**Minji (L2, Korean):** You too! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Talk to you later.
