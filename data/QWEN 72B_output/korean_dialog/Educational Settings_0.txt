**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minji! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, um, I am good. Thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I heard you have a question about the assignment?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, um, I have question about... how to say... the essay we need to write.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. What specifically are you unsure about?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Well, the prompt says we need to write about the impact of technology on society. But, um, I am not sure how to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a common challenge. One way to start is by brainstorming the main points you want to cover. What are some initial ideas you have?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I think about... how technology make life easier, and also, um, the problem with privacy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great ideas! Those are both important aspects. You could start with an introduction that outlines these points. Then, each body paragraph can focus on one of those topics.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I see. So, I write introduction first, and then, um, one paragraph for each point?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And don’t forget to use examples to support your arguments. For instance, you could talk about how smartphones have changed communication.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that make sense. I also have question about the word count. How many words we need to write?

**Speaker A (NS):** The assignment sheet says the essay should be around 1,500 words. Make sure to stay close to that length.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, 1,500 words. And um, do we need to use outside sources?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it’s a good idea to include at least three credible sources to support your points. You can use academic journals or reputable websites.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I understand. Thank you so much for help. I feel much better now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to help! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Good luck with your essay!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, really. I will try my best. Have a good day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Minji. Have a great day, and see you in class!
