**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! Thanks for meeting today. We’re going to discuss the topic of quantum mechanics. It can be pretty challenging. Have you started looking into it at all?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi! Thank you for inviting me. Um, I start reading about it, but it is... um, very hard to understand. I have many question.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s totally normal. It’s a complex topic. Let’s break it down. One of the key concepts is the idea of superposition. Do you know what that means?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I think... it is about particle can be in two place at same time?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start! Superposition means that a particle can exist in multiple states at the same time until it’s observed. It’s like a coin that’s both heads and tails until you look at it.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, so it is like... um, how to say... it is not decided until we see it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Another important concept is entanglement. Have you heard of that?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I read about. It is when particle connect, even if far apart?

**Speaker A (NS):** Right! When particles are entangled, the state of one particle instantly affects the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. It’s like if you have two coins that are always the same when you flip them, even if they’re in different rooms.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I see. So, if I change one, other one change too?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s exactly it! It’s a bit mind-bending, but it’s one of the most fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics. Does that help clarify things a bit?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it is more clear now. Thank you for explaining. I will study more to understand better.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great attitude! If you have more questions, feel free to reach out. We can review this again next week.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sure. I will send you message if I have question. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Have a great week, Jisoo. See you next time!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. See you next time! Bye!
