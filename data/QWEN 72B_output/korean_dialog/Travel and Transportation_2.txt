**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Minji! How are you? Have you thought about where we should go for our group vacation?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, I’m good, thanks! Um, I think about beach. Beach is nice, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Do you have any specific place in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, how to say... Jeju? But I not sure if everyone like Jeju.

**Speaker A (NS):** Jeju is a great choice! It’s beautiful and has a lot to offer. What do you think we could do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We can, um, go to beach, and maybe, how to say... hike in mountains?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect! We could also try some local food and visit some of the waterfalls. What do you think about the timing? When should we go?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe, how to say... late October? Weather is good, not too hot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Late October sounds great. It’s usually a beautiful time to visit Jeju. How long should we stay?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** About, um, four days? Five, maybe?

**Speaker A (NS):** Five days sounds good. What about the budget? How much do you think each person should contribute?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I think, maybe... 500,000 won? That is enough for hotel and food, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, 500,000 won is a reasonable budget. We can split the costs evenly. That works out to about $400 per person.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, that is good! We can, um, make list of things to do and places to eat?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! We can start a group chat and share ideas. Who else are you thinking of inviting?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, Jisoo, Seung, and maybe, how to say... Jiyeon?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll message them and see if they’re free. We can finalize the plans soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that is good. I’m excited!

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Thanks for the suggestions, Minji. Let’s catch up soon to confirm everything.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay! See you, and thanks. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you, Minji! Have a great day!
