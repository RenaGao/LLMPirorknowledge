**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, I am good. Thanks for asking. Um, how to say... today is little bit busy, but good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! I wanted to talk about the project we're working on. Do you have a few minutes?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I have time. Sure, what you want to talk about?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. I was thinking about our upcoming deadlines. We have the first draft due next week, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that is correct. We need to finish it by Friday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right. How’s your part coming along?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is going good. I finish most of it. I just need to check some detail... um, how to say... some details.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to hear. Can you let me know if you run into any issues? I want to make sure we’re on track.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I will. Um, I have question about the format. Should we use APA or MLA?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s use APA for this project. It’s the standard for our department.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Got it. APA. Thank you. And what about the references?

**Speaker A (NS):** Make sure to include all the sources we’ve used. Double-check the citations to avoid any mistakes.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will do that. I also want to add some chart... um, how to say... some charts and graphs.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. Visuals can really help to clarify the data. Just make sure they’re clear and labeled properly.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I will. Um, how to say... one more thing. Can we meet tomorrow to go over the draft together?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, that sounds good. What time works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** How about afternoon? Two o'clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Two o'clock works for me. Let’s meet in the conference room.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I will be there. Thanks.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. I’ll see you then. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too. Bye!
