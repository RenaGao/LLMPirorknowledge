**Scene: Minji and Jisoo are discussing plans for the weekend. Minji forgot about a prior commitment and has to reschedule.**

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Jisoo! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks for asking! So, I wanted to talk to you about our plans for this weekend.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes. We plan to go to Han River, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Actually, Jisoo, I need to apologize. I forgot I have a prior commitment on Saturday morning. I’m really sorry.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, no problem. It happen. What time you have commitment?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. So, I won’t be able to meet you in the morning.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I see. How about afternoon? We can meet later?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! What do you think about meeting at 3 p.m. instead?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** 3 p.m. is fine. We can still go to Han River, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! We can still have a great time. We can start with a bike ride and then grab some chicken.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like that plan. We can rent bikes from park, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, there’s a rental shop near the park. We just need to make sure we have our IDs.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Right, I will bring my ID. Is there anything else we need?

**Speaker A (NS):** Just some sunscreen and maybe a water bottle. The weather is supposed to be really nice.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Good idea. I will bring. I am looking forward to it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! I’m really excited. Thanks for being so understanding about the change.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No problem. It is okay. I see you on Saturday at 3 p.m.!

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! See you then. Have a great day, Jisoo!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Bye-bye!
