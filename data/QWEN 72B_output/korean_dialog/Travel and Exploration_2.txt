**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, can I ask you for some help?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, of course. What do you need help with?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m new in town and I’m trying to find the Han River Park. Could you tell me how to get there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sure! Han River Park is... um, it is not far from here. You can take... how to say... the bus or the subway.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, which bus or subway line should I take?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You can take the subway. Take line 2 and get off at... um, Hangangjin Station. It is... it is easy to find.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I’ll take line 2 to Hangangjin Station. What should I do when I get off?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** When you get off, you need to go to exit 4. Then, you walk straight for about... ah, 10 minutes.

**Speaker A (NS):** And then what?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** After 10 minutes, you will see... um, the park entrance on your right side. It is... it is very big and you cannot miss it.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds clear. Is there anything else I should know?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, you should... you should check the weather before you go. It is... it is very nice these days, but it can change quickly.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good to know. Thank you so much for the directions!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You’re welcome! If you need more help, um, you can ask me. I am... I am happy to help.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very kind of you. I really appreciate it. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! You too. Bye-bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
