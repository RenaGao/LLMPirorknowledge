**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking. So, I heard you wanted some advice on staying healthy?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I want to be more... more healthy. You know, eat good food and do exercise.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great goal! One thing you can do is make sure you have a balanced diet. Include lots of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I see. Um, how much... how much fruits and vegetables?

**Speaker A (NS):** Aim for about 5 to 7 servings a day. It’s a good guideline.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I will try. And exercise, what kind of exercise you recommend?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, you can start with something simple like walking or jogging. Even 30 minutes a day can make a big difference.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Jogging sounds good. I like to run. And maybe... um, how to say... yoga?

**Speaker A (NS):** Try to do it at least 3 to 4 times a week. Consistency is key.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Okay, I will do it. Also, I want to drink more water. Is that good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Staying hydrated is very important. Aim for about 8 glasses a day.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Eight glasses, got it. And, um, I will try to go to bed early. I hear sleep is important too.
