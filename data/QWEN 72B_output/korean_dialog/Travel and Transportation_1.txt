**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Can you help me with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, of course! What you need help with?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm trying to find the Grand Hotel. Could you help me with directions?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, yes. The Grand Hotel is not far from here. Um, how to say... go straight this road, then turn right at first corner.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, so I go straight and then turn right at the first corner. Got it. What's after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** After you turn right, you walk about three blocks. Then, um, look for big building on left side. It is red and white, you cannot miss it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, so I walk three blocks and look for a big red and white building on the left. Is it a tall building?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it is tall. It is the tallest building on that street.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks! Is it safe to walk there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it is very safe. You can walk there without worry. But, um, it is good idea to be careful with your belongings, like always.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's good to know. Are there any notable landmarks I should look out for along the way?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, there is small park on your left side after you turn right. You can see it, and it is good place to rest if you need.

**Speaker A (NS):** A small park, got it. That sounds helpful. Thank you so much for the detailed directions!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You are welcome! I hope you enjoy your stay at Grand Hotel. If you need more help, please come back and ask me.

**Speaker A (NS):** I will do that. Thanks again! Have a great day.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
