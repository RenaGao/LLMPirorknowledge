**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo! How's it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, um... I am fine. Thanks. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm good, thanks! Do you have any plans for this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, not really. I... think I am free. Why?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I was wondering if you wanted to do something together. Maybe go to the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, that sounds nice. Park is good. Um, how about we go to Han River? I hear the weather is really nice now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, that's a great idea! The weather is perfect for a day out. What do you want to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We can... um, eat something and maybe ride bicycles. How to say... bike ride?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, a bike ride! That sounds fun. Do you know where we can rent bikes?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think there is a place near the park. Hmm, how to say... bike rental shop?

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, a bike rental shop. That's perfect. What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, how about eleven o'clock? Eleven...

**Speaker A (NS):** 11 a.m. sounds good. Where do you want to meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We can meet at the park entrance. You know, um, the big sign?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I know the place. That works for me. See you then?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you then! Thanks for asking me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! Have a good weekend, Jisoo!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
