**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo, how's it going? You ready for our upcoming exam next week?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hi! Um, I am little nervous. Exam is... um... how to say... important.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, it is. Have you started studying yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I start yesterday. I read textbook and make note. But, um... I have trouble with some part.

**Speaker A (NS):** What part are you having trouble with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... the, the... chapter about... um... chemical reactions. It is hard for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. Chemical reactions can be tricky. Do you want to go over them together?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, please. That would be very help. When we can meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about tomorrow afternoon? Say, around 3 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** 3 p.m. is good. Where we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let's meet at the library. It’s quiet there, and we can use the study rooms.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, library is okay. But, um... how to say... little far from my house. Can we meet at café near school?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, that works. There’s a nice café right across from the school. It’s called Bean and Leaf.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Bean and Leaf? I know place. Yes, that is good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, 3 p.m. at Bean and Leaf. We can go over the chemical reactions and any other topics you need help with.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you. I will bring my textbook and note. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. See you then, Jisoo. Good luck with your studying!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! Good luck to you too. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Take care!
