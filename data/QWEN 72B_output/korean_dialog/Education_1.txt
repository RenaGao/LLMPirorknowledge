**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo! How's everything going with your studies?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello! Everything is good. I have a little problem with one topic in our class. Can you help me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What’s the topic you’re having trouble with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** It is... um, how to say... photosynthesis? I not understand it very well.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Photosynthesis can be a bit tricky. It’s the process where plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. Do you know the basic steps?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, but I not sure about... um, how the light... light thing... light energy is used.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. The light energy is captured by a pigment called chlorophyll, which is in the leaves of the plant. This light energy is used to split water molecules.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I see. So, the water molecules... they... break?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! The water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the air as a byproduct, and the hydrogen is used to make glucose.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Glucose? That is the sugar, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, glucose is a type of sugar. It’s the food that the plant uses for energy and growth. The process can be summarized as: light energy + water + carbon dioxide → glucose + oxygen.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Uh-huh. So, the light energy help to make... um, sugar and oxygen?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right! The light energy is crucial because it provides the energy needed to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think I understand now. Can you... um, give me an example of how this works in real life?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Think of a tree in your backyard. The leaves on the tree contain chlorophyll. When sunlight hits the leaves, the chlorophyll captures the light energy. The tree then uses this energy to convert water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air into glucose and oxygen.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, I get it now. The tree makes its own food and gives us oxygen. That is very cool.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! It’s a really fascinating process. Do you have any more questions about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** No, I think I good now. Thank you so much for helping me.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Jisoo! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! You too. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care!
