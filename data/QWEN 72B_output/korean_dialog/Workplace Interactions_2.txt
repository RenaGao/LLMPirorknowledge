**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minji! Thanks for joining this call. How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, I am good. Thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. So, we need to plan our team meeting for next week. What do you think about the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes. We should talk about... um, how to say... project updates. And... and also, maybe we can talk about new ideas for the next quarter?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great. Do you have any specific projects or ideas in mind that we should discuss?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think we should talk about the marketing... marketing... um, campaign for the new product. And also, how to... how to... improve our team communication.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good points. We can definitely include those. What about a time slot for the meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, maybe... how to say... ten o'clock in the morning? Or is it... is it too early?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten a.m. works for me. Do you think everyone else will be available then?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think so. But we can send email to confirm. How to... how to... send a reminder?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. We can send out a calendar invite with the agenda and a reminder. What other items should we include on the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, we can talk about... talk about... uh, team building activities. And maybe... maybe some feedback on the current projects?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s add those. So, the agenda will have project updates, new marketing campaign ideas, team communication, team building activities, and feedback on current projects. Does that sound good to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, it sound good. That is all, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s all. Thanks, Minji. I’ll send out the meeting invite and agenda. Have a great day!
