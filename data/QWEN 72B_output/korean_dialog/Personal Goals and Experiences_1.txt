**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! Can you tell me about a skill you want to learn and why it’s important to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um... I want to learn cooking. How to say... cook more variety of food. It is important for me because I like to eat different kinds of food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great goal! What kind of dishes are you interested in cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I like... um, Italian food and Korean food. I want to make... how to say... pasta and bibimbap.

**Speaker A (NS):** Pasta and bibimbap! Those are both delicious. Have you tried making any of these dishes before?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I try make pasta, but not very good. Bibimbap is... um, I can make little bit, but not perfect.

**Speaker A (NS):** Don’t worry, practice makes perfect! Do you have a favorite recipe or a specific dish you want to start with?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I want to start with spaghetti carbonara. It look easy, but good taste.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great choice! Carbonara is a classic. How do you plan to learn this skill?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I will watch video on YouTube and read cookbooks. Maybe... how to say... take cooking class?

**Speaker A (NS):** Taking a cooking class is a fantastic idea! It can provide hands-on experience and tips from professionals. Do you have any other reasons why learning to cook is important to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I want to... um, make food for my family and friends. It is... how to say... bond with them.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a wonderful reason! Cooking can be a great way to spend time with loved ones and share something you enjoy. Have you set any specific goals for your cooking journey?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I want to... how to say... cook dinner for my family every week. And also, I want to make one new dish every month.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those are very achievable goals! I’m sure you’ll have a lot of fun and improve your skills. Do you have any other hobbies or interests?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like hiking and photography. Hiking is good for health, and photography... um, it is fun to capture beautiful moments.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome! Hiking and photography are great hobbies. They can complement your cooking skills by giving you new inspirations for your dishes. It was great talking to you about your goals!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, thank you for listening. I will work hard to achieve my goals. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Good luck with your cooking journey! Take care and see you later!
