**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo, how are you doing? Have you started studying for the upcoming test?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hey, I am good. Um, yes, I start little bit. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve been working on it a bit too. Do you feel prepared?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Not really. I think I need more practice. What do you usually do when you study?

**Speaker A (NS):** I usually make a study schedule and break down the topics into smaller parts. That helps me stay organized. 

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** That sound good. I try to read the textbook, but sometimes it hard to understand. Any other tips?

**Speaker A (NS):** Try summarizing the key points in your own words. It can help you remember them better. Also, doing practice problems is really helpful.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, yes. Practice problems. I forget about that. Where can I find them?

**Speaker A (NS):** The professor usually has some on the course website. You can also use old exams or find additional resources online.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Good idea. I will check those out. Do you want to study together sometime this week?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, that would be great! When are you free?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I am free on Wednesday afternoon. How about three o’clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good to me. Where do you want to meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Let’s meet at the library. It is quiet and good for studying.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll bring some practice problems and we can go over them together.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Great. Thank you for your help. See you on Wednesday!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! See you then. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too. Bye!
