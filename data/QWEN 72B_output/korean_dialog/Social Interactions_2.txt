**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Minji! How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, Sarah! Um, I am good. How you are?
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking! It’s been a while. How’s life in Seoul?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Life is... um, very busy. I have many work to do. But also, very nice. How about you?
**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve been keeping busy too, but it’s good. I was thinking, maybe we could catch up over the weekend? What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, um, that sound good! I have some free time this weekend. How we meet?
**Speaker A (NS):** How about we have a video call? That way we can see each other.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Video call, that good idea. I like. Um, what time we call?
**Speaker A (NS):** What about 2 p.m. your time? Is that okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, 2 p.m. is fine. I can... how to say... adjust my schedule.
**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll send you a link for the call. Do you have any plans before or after we talk?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, no big plan. Maybe I go to Han River with my friend. We like to ride... how to say... bicycle.
**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds like fun! The weather is so nice these days, perfect for outdoor activities.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, weather is very nice. We plan to eat chicken while we ride. Um, like picnic.
**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! How do you like to cook the chicken?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We usually buy from... um, restaurant. It is more easy and tasty.
**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Any recommendations for a good place to get chicken?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, yes, there is one place near Han River. Name is... how to say... "Chicken Paradise." Very good!
**Speaker A (NS):** "Chicken Paradise" sounds perfect! I’ll have to try it if I ever visit Seoul.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, you should. It will be very nice experience.
**Speaker A (NS):** I’m looking forward to our call on Saturday. It will be great to catch up!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, me too. I look forward to talk with you. Um, see you then!
**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Take care, Minji.
**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too, Sarah. Bye!
**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Minji!
