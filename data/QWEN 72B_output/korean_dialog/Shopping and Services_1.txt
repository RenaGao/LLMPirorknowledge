**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Jisoo! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. So, I heard you're thinking about buying a new phone. What kind of features are you looking for?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I want new phone. Um, I like long battery, and... um, how to say... good camera.

**Speaker A (NS):** Long battery life and a good camera, got it. What about the screen size and the price?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Screen, um, big screen is good. And price... not too expensive, please.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Have you looked at any specific models?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I look at... um, Samsung and Apple. But I not sure which one to choose.

**Speaker A (NS):** Both are great options. What about the operating system? Do you prefer iOS or Android?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I use... um, iOS before. But I hear Android is also good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, they both have their strengths. Android tends to be more customizable, while iOS is known for its user-friendliness and integration with other Apple devices.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like how easy to use iOS, but maybe I try Android this time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. Have you checked any reviews or user feedback for the models you’re considering?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I read some reviews. But I think... um, I need to go to store to see phone.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely, seeing it in person can make a big difference. Which store are you thinking of going to?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Maybe... um, electronics store... like Best Buy?

**Speaker A (NS):** Best Buy is a good choice. They usually have a wide selection and knowledgeable staff. When do you plan to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think... um, this weekend. I have free time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Do you want some company? I can go with you if you’d like.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** That would be nice! Thank you. You can help me choose.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I’d be happy to help. Let’s plan to meet there on Saturday afternoon. Sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that is good. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. See you this Saturday. Have a great day, Jisoo!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too. Bye!
