**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hi! I am good. Thank you. How you doing?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I was thinking, what does your morning routine look like?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, my morning routine... I wake up at seven. I, uh, have breakfast, then... I take shower. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds similar to mine. I usually wake up at 6:30 and start with some light exercise. Then I have breakfast and get ready for the day. Do you have any specific breakfast you like?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I like to have... um, how you say... bread and eggs. Sometimes, I have porridge. It is, um, warm and good for start day.

**Speaker A (NS):** Porridge sounds nice! I sometimes have oatmeal with fruits and honey. What do you do after breakfast?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** After breakfast, I read news or check email. Then, I go to work. I have, um, meeting usually in morning.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good way to start the day. I usually read a bit or listen to podcasts before heading to work. Do you do anything special to unwind in the evening?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I, um, watch some TV or read book. Sometimes, I go for walk. It is, um, good for relax.

**Speaker A (NS):** Walking is a great way to unwind. I often do the same. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I, um, maybe go to park with friends. We can, um, how to say... picnic and chat.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like fun! Do you want to join us for a picnic this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I would like! When and where we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about meeting at the park near Hangang at 11 a.m. on Saturday?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Perfect! I will be there. See you then!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! See you on Saturday. Have a good day, Jisoo!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You too! Bye!
