**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Minji! How’s it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks! So, I was thinking, since we’re both interested in different cultures, maybe we could talk about dining etiquette. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that sounds good! Um, how to say... dining etiquette is very important in Korea, you know.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Can you tell me about some of the key things to remember when eating in Korea?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Sure! Um, in Korea, we usually wait for the oldest person to start eating. Also, we should not put our chopsticks standing up in the rice bowl. It is, um, how to say... not good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really interesting! In the U.S., we usually wait for everyone to be served before starting, but we don’t have that specific rule about chopsticks. What about other table manners?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Right, we also, um, do not pour our own drink. We should pour for others and let them pour for us. And, we use both hands when giving or receiving something, especially from elders.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so polite! In the U.S., using both hands isn’t as common, but we do try to be respectful. We also have some rules about using utensils. For example, you should place your fork and knife in a certain way to show you’re finished.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I see. In Korea, we also place the spoon and chopsticks neatly on the table when we’re finished. And, um, we say "Thank you for the meal" to show appreciation.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great tradition! In the U.S., we often say "Thank you" to the person who cooked, but it’s not as formal. Do you have any other interesting dining customs?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, um, in Korea, we often eat communal dishes, so we use, um, common spoons and chopsticks to serve food. This is, how to say... more hygienic and respectful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really thoughtful! I think in the U.S., we’re starting to adopt more communal eating, especially in certain cultural settings like potlucks. It’s a nice way to share and bond.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I agree. It is, um, make the meal more enjoyable and friendly. By the way, maybe we can try Korean dining etiquette together sometime?

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be fun! We could have a little Korean dinner night at my place.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that sounds great! I will bring some Korean dishes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’m looking forward to it. Thanks for sharing all this with me, Minji.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you, too. It was nice talking to you. Have a good day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Bye, Minji!
