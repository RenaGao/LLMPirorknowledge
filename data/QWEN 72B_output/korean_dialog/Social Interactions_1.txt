**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jisoo! What are you up to this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, hi! No, nothing special. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not much either. Actually, I was thinking we could plan a birthday surprise for Minji. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think good idea. She will be very happy. What we can do?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about we have a little party at my place? We can cook some food, play games, and maybe get her a small gift.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, sounds good. But, how to say... do you think she like that?

**Speaker A (NS):** I think she’ll love it. She’s always up for a good time with friends. What kind of food do you think we should make?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** How about... um, pizza and some Korean food? Maybe bulgogi or japchae?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! I can help with the pizza, and you can take care of the Korean dishes. What time do you want to start?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** How about... um, 7 o'clock? So we have time to prepare everything.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Should we invite a few more friends?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, a few more. But not too many. Maybe 5 or 6?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. I’ll send out some invites. What about decorations? Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We can use balloons and maybe some streamers. And, um, how to say... confetti?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, confetti sounds fun! I can pick those up. Do you want to bring a game or something to play?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I can bring some board games. We can play Uno or Monopoly.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! And for her gift, what do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** How about... um, a book or a nice notebook? She likes reading and writing.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. I’ll get her a book, and you can choose the notebook. When do you want to go shopping?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** How about... um, tomorrow afternoon? After class?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect. I’ll meet you at the bookstore after class. Thanks for helping, Jisoo!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You welcome. I am happy to help. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow! Let’s make it a great surprise for Minji!
