**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minji! How are you? Can you tell me about a recent memorable event and how it made you feel?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi! I am good, thank you. Um, let me think... Ah, yes! Last weekend, I go to Han River with my friend Jisoo. We have very nice time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! What did you do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We eat chicken and ride bike. Weather is so good, very warm but not too hot. We talk and laugh a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a perfect day! Did you do anything else at the Han River?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we also take many pictures. I post some on Instagram. My friends like it. They say they want to go too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's awesome! How did it make you feel?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I feel very happy and relaxed. It is good to spend time with friend. We talk about many things, and I forget about stress from school and work.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's always great to have those moments to unwind. Did you have any plans to go back soon?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we plan to go again next weekend. Maybe we try different place in Han River.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a fun idea! Do you have any specific place in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, how to say... there is park with big grass area. We can have picnic there. I think it is called Seonyudo Park.

**Speaker A (NS):** Seonyudo Park, that's a beautiful spot! It's perfect for picnics. I hope you have a great time there.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you! I sure will. It is always nice to have someone to share good time with.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! It sounds like you and Jisoo have a lot of fun together. Thanks for sharing that with me, Minji.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** You welcome! It is my pleasure. Talk to you later, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, take care! See you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Bye! Have a good day!
