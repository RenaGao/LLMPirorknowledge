**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Minji! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Hi, I'm good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I heard you have some ideas for a cultural event to share your traditions. Could you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, um... I want to have festival, like... like Korean food and music.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! What kind of food do you have in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think we can have... um... bibimbap, kimchi, and... and maybe some makgeolli.

**Speaker A (NS):** Makgeolli is a traditional Korean rice wine, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that right. It is very popular. And also, we can have Korean bbq.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, that would be delicious! What about the music?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** For music, we can have... um, traditional Korean instrument, like gayageum and... and drum.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great choice! Do you have any specific activities or games in mind for the event?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, we can have... um... traditional game, like yutnori, and also, people can try on hanbok, Korean traditional dress.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! How about decorations? Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** We can use... um... colorful paper lanterns and... and traditional fans.

**Speaker A (NS):** Beautiful! And what about the timing and location?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think we can do it... um... in the park, like... like on a sunny day, maybe next month.

**Speaker A (NS):** Next month sounds perfect. Do you need any help with organizing the event?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, that would be very helpful. Can you help with... um... setting up and preparing food?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I'd be happy to help. Itâ€™s going to be a fantastic event!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you so much! I can't wait.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Let's keep in touch and start planning. See you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you! Thank you!
