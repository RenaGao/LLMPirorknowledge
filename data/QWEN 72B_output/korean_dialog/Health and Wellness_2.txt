**Scene: A fitness trainer, Alex (Native Speaker), and a client, Minji (Second-Language Speaker, Korean), are discussing exercise routines and fitness goals.**

**Alex (NS):** Hi, Minji! How are you today?

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Hi, Alex! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Alex (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, what brings you here today? Are you interested in starting a new exercise routine?

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Yes, I want to start. I... um, I want to get healthier and lose some weight.

**Alex (NS):** Great goal! What kind of exercises do you enjoy the most?

**Minji (L2, Korean):** I like... um, how to say... running and maybe swimming.

**Alex (NS):** That’s awesome! Running and swimming are both great for cardiovascular health. How often do you think you can commit to exercising each week?

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Um, I can do three time... three times a week, maybe?

**Alex (NS):** Perfect! Three times a week is a good start. How long can you dedicate each session?

**Minji (L2, Korean):** I think I can do... um, one hour each time.

**Alex (NS):** One hour sounds good. Let’s plan some activities. For running, we can start with 20 minutes and gradually increase the time. What about some strength training exercises?

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Um, I am not sure about strength training. I think it is good, but I am not familiar.

**Alex (NS):** No problem! We can start with some basic exercises like push-ups, squats, and planks. They are easy to do and very effective.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Okay, I can try. How many times I do each exercise?

**Alex (NS):** Let’s start with three sets of 10 reps for each exercise. You can always adjust as you get more comfortable.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** I see. And for swimming, how long I should swim?

**Alex (NS):** For swimming, you can start with 30 minutes and focus on maintaining a steady pace. As you get more comfortable, you can increase the duration.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Sounds good. I will try my best.

**Alex (NS):** That’s the spirit! Do you have any dietary goals as well?

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Yes, I want to eat more vegetables and less sugary food. Um, I think I can do this.

**Alex (NS):** Excellent! Eating a balanced diet will complement your exercise routine. Just keep it consistent and you’ll see great results.

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Thank you, Alex. I am excited to start.

**Alex (NS):** I’m excited for you too! Let’s check in next week to see how you’re doing. Have a great day, Minji!

**Minji (L2, Korean):** Thank you! You too. Bye!

**Alex (NS):** Bye, Minji! See you next week!
