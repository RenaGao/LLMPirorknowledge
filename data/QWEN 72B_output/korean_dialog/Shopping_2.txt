**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Good. But, um... I want to ask, can I get money back or... how to say... exchange for different product?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, you can choose either a refund or an exchange. Which would you prefer?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I think exchange. I want different model, better one.

**Speaker A (NS):** That works. Do you have a specific model in mind, or would you like some recommendations?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I see... how to say... in the store, there is better one. Can you show me?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Thank you. I appreciate it.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Here’s a newer model that has better reviews. Would you like to try this one?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, I think this one looks good. How much is it?
