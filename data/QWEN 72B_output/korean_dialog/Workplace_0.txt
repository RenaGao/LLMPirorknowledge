**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, can you be a bit more specific? What parts are still pending?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, um, the testing part. We need more time to test everything, make sure no bug.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. When do you think you'll be able to complete the testing?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, I think... we can finish testing by next Friday, but it depend on how many bug we find.
