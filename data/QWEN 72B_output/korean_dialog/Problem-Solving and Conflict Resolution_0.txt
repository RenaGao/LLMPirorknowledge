**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Minji! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. Is now a good time?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, yes. What is it? You look little worried.

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I think there might have been a misunderstanding last weekend. We were supposed to meet for coffee, but you didn't show up. I was a bit concerned.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Oh, I am so sorry! I forget about it. I have very busy day. Um, my... how to say... my grandmother was not feeling well.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. I didn't know that. Is she okay now?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, she is better now. I should tell you before, I know. I feel very bad about it.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, Minji. I understand things come up. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay on your end.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** I really sorry. Can we meet this weekend instead? I promise I will not forget.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! How about we meet on Saturday at the park? We can have a picnic.

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, picnic sound nice. I bring Korean food, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be amazing! I love Korean food. What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Um, how about... one o'clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** One o'clock works perfectly. Can't wait to see you!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Me too. Thank you for understanding. I will not forget this time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, no problem. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Korean):** Yes, see you then. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Minji! Take care!
