**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, picnic is good idea! Um, how to say... we can bring um... sandwiches, and fruits, and... maybe some drinks?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! Do you have a favorite spot in mind for the picnic?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, there is park near my house. It is very nice. We can go there. It have big trees and nice grass.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! What about the weather? Do you think it will be nice this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I check weather app. It says it will be sunny and not too hot. Good day for picnic!

**Speaker A (NS):** Wonderful! What time do you think we should meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... how about ten o'clock? That is not too early and not too late.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten o'clock sounds perfect. How about we bring some games to play as well? Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, good idea! We can bring frisbee, and... um, card games, and maybe some board games.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll pack some snacks and drinks. Do you have any favorite snacks you’d like to bring?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I can bring some Japanese snacks, like um... rice crackers and um... how to say... mochi?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, mochi! That sounds delicious. Thanks for offering. Should we also bring a blanket to sit on?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, definitely. We can bring big blanket so everyone can sit comfortable.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll also bring some sun protection, like sunscreen and hats. Is there anything else we should consider?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... maybe we need some trash bags for cleaning up after picnic.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good point! We should definitely bring trash bags. I’ll make sure to pack those.
