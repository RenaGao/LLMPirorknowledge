**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I'm looking at these beautiful kimonos. Do you know the price?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, welcome! These kimono, they are very beautiful. This one, it is 5000 yen.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's quite a price. Could you tell me a bit more about the kimono? What makes it so special?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sure! This kimono is made with silk. It is hand-dyed, and the pattern is traditional. We make it here in Kyoto.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that sounds really special. I really like it, but 5000 yen is a bit steep for me. Can you offer me a better price?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, how to say... I can give you a discount. Maybe... 4500 yen?

**Speaker A (NS):** 4500 yen is still a bit high for my budget. Could you go a bit lower, maybe 4000 yen?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Let me see... (pauses) Okay, I think I can do 4200 yen. Is this good for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** 4200 yen is closer, but I was hoping for 4000 yen. Could you consider that?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see. (pauses) Okay, 4000 yen. But this is the best price I can give.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's fair. Thank you for the discount! This kimono is perfect for me. I'll take it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Great! I will wrap it for you. (wraps the kimono) Here you go. Thank you for your purchase!

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you! Itâ€™s really beautiful. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! Arigatou gozaimasu. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
