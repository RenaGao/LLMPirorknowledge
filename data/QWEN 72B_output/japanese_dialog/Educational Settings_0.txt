**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi, Teacher. I, um, I am good. Thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking! So, what can I help you with today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes. I, um, have question about, um... homework.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What specifically are you unsure about?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** The, um, last part of the assignment. It says, “Discuss the impact of... um, technology on society.” I not sure what to write.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, let’s break it down. The assignment is asking you to think about how technology has changed different aspects of society. For example, you could discuss how it affects communication, education, or even jobs.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, I see. So, I can write about, um, how people use, um... how to say... phone or internet to talk with each other?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You could talk about how smartphones and the internet have made communication faster and more convenient. But also, consider any negative impacts, like how it might affect face-to-face interactions.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, yes. I understand. And, um, for education, I can write about, um... online class?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s a great point! You could discuss how online classes have made education more accessible, especially for people in remote areas. But also, think about the challenges, like the need for reliable internet access.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, I see. And, um, for jobs, I can write about, um... how technology change, um... how people work?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s a good angle. You could talk about how technology has created new jobs, like software developers and data analysts, but also how it has changed traditional jobs, like manufacturing and retail.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I understand. I, um, will write about these things. Thank you, Teacher.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Sora! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Good luck with your assignment!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. Um, see you next class!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a great day!
