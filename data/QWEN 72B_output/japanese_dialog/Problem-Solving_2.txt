**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Aki! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi, Sora! I am fine, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. So, I wanted to talk to you about something. Remember the plan for our trip to Kyoto?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I remember. We are going tomorrow, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Actually, I have to apologize. I made a mistake with the train tickets. I booked the tickets for the wrong time.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, no! Um, what time did you book?

**Speaker A (NS):** I accidentally booked for 8 a.m. instead of 9 a.m. I know we agreed on 9 a.m. because we both wanted to get a bit of extra sleep.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I see. It is early... but, um, how to say, I can manage. What do you think?

**Speaker A (NS):** I really feel bad about this. I’ll cancel the tickets and book them for 9 a.m. instead. Is that okay with you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That would be great. Thank you for fixing it, Sora. I do not mind waiting a little.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, Aki. I really appreciate your understanding. I’ll make sure to double-check everything this time.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No problem. I am looking forward to our trip. Kyoto is beautiful, and the food is amazing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! I can’t wait to try all the delicious food there. Let’s make sure to try some traditional Kyoto dishes.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to try kaiseki. It is very special.

**Speaker A (NS):** Kaiseki sounds fantastic! We’ll definitely find a good place to try it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I will do some research and send you some options. We can decide together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. Thank you, Aki. I’ll book the tickets for 9 a.m. and confirm the details with you.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sounds good. I will see you at the station tomorrow morning at 9.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Have a good night, Aki. I’ll see you tomorrow!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Good night, Sora! See you tomorrow!
