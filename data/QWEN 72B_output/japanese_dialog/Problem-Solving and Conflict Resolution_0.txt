**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Sora, how’s it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, hi! I, ah, I’m okay. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about something. I noticed we had a bit of a misunderstanding yesterday.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, I sorry. I think I maybe not understand you.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries. Can you tell me what you understood from our conversation yesterday?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I think you say we go to Kyoto next weekend, but I have work on Saturday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. I actually meant to say that we could go on Sunday. I thought you were free that day.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, I see. I, um, I have work on Saturday, but Sunday is okay. How to say... I can go on Sunday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! That’s what I was hoping. I’m really looking forward to it. We can see the historical places and try some yummy food.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, me too. I, um, I like to try new food, especially Japanese food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome! And we can figure out the best way to get there. What do you think about taking the bullet train?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, bullet train is good, but it is little expensive. Maybe we can take express bus?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good point. The express bus is definitely cheaper and it’s still a good option. Let’s check the schedules and decide.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we can check schedule. I will send you link later.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And let’s meet at the station at 9 a.m. on Sunday. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, 9 a.m. is good. I will be there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’m really excited. Thanks for clearing this up, Sora.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Me too. Sorry again for misunderstanding. See you Sunday!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. See you Sunday! Bye, Sora!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Bye, take care!
