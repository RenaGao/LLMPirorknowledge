**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Sora! What are your plans for tomorrow?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! I do not have special plans for tomorrow. How to say... Why you ask?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m thinking of planning a birthday surprise for Aki. Want to join us?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is nice idea! Aki like surprised, I think. What we do?

**Speaker A (NS):** We were thinking about organizing a small party at a cafe. We can also do some sightseeing in Kyoto if you’re up for it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Kyoto, ah! Kyoto have many history place. And also, um... good food, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! There’s a lot of delicious food there. We could try some traditional Kyoto cuisine.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I like that. What we need for party?

**Speaker A (NS):** We need decorations, a cake, and some snacks. Do you have any ideas for decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, we can use, how to say... balloons? And also, um, colorful paper, for streamers?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great ideas! We can also make some homemade decorations. What about the snacks?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We can bring some, um, Japanese snacks. Maybe, um, mochi and, ah, senbei?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Aki will love those. How about the transportation? Have you checked how to get there?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I look. Bullet train is fastest, but maybe, um, little bit expensive.

**Speaker A (NS):** True. What about the express bus?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, express bus, that is good idea. It is cheaper and not too long, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good to me! We can leave early to make sure we have plenty of time. What time works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, nine a.m., that is okay for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We’ll meet at the station at 9 a.m. then.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is good. I will bring snacks and, um, decorations.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Thanks for your help, Sora. I’m sure Aki will really enjoy it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome. I am happy to help. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow! Take care!
