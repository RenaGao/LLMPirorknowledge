**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aki! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi, Sora! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I was wondering if you could tell me about a traditional festival in Japan.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sure! One of the most famous is... um, how to say... Cherry Blossom Festival. In Japanese, we call it "Hanami."

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Hanami! I've heard of it. When does it usually take place?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It usually happens in April, but it depends on weather. In Tokyo, it is often end of March or early April.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. What do people typically do during Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** People go to park and have picnic under cherry blossom trees. We eat special food, um... "bento," and drink sake.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! What kind of food do you usually have in the bento?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Bento has many things. Um... rice, fish, pickles, and sometimes, um... uh, sushi.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sushi sounds delicious! Is there anything else people do during Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, some people, um... sing songs and dance. It is very fun and relaxing time with family and friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a beautiful tradition. Are there any other festivals you would recommend visiting in Japan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, Gion Matsuri in Kyoto is very famous. It is in July and has big parade with floats.

**Speaker A (NS):** I've heard about Gion Matsuri too! It sounds amazing. Have you ever been to it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I have been. It is very beautiful and crowded, but it is worth it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I bet! Thanks so much for sharing, Aki. I'd love to experience these festivals someday.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You should! I think you will enjoy it very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** I will! Thanks again. Talk to you later, Aki!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, talk to you later! Bye-bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye-bye! Take care!
