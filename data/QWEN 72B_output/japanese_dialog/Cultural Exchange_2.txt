**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aki! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking! I was thinking, since we’re both from different places, it would be interesting to talk about holidays. What’s your favorite holiday in Japan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, favorite holiday... It is hard to choose, but I think New Year’s Day is special.

**Speaker A (NS):** New Year’s Day, that’s a great choice! What do you usually do during New Year’s?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I visit shrine with my family. We pray for good luck and health. And, um... we eat special food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! What kind of special food do you eat?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We eat mochi, which is sticky rice cake. And also, um... osechi-ryori. It is... um, how to say... traditional New Year’s food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Osechi-ryori, got it! It’s a traditional New Year’s meal with lots of symbolic dishes, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is right. Each dish has special meaning. For example, um, kohaku kamaboko is pink and white fish cake. It means good fortune.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really interesting! Do you do anything else to celebrate?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We watch New Year’s TV program called “Kohaku Uta Gassen.” It is like music show with famous singers.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’ve heard of that! It sounds like a big event. Do you have a favorite part of the holiday?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I like spending time with family. We talk and laugh, and it is very warm and happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a wonderful way to celebrate. I really love that sense of togetherness. Thanks for sharing, Aki! 

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome. It was nice to talk about it.

**Speaker A (NS):** It was great chatting with you. Have a good day, Aki!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too! Bye-bye!
