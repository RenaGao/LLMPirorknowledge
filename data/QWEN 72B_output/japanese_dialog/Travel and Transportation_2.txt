**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Sora! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I was thinking about planning a group vacation. Do you have any ideas for a destination?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Uh, yes... I think Kyoto is very nice place. Many historical things and good food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! Kyoto is beautiful. What kind of activities would you like to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I want to see... um, how to say... famous temples and gardens. And also, I want to try... um, Japanese thing for cooking, kyou-ryouri.

**Speaker A (NS):** Kyo-ryori, right! I’d love to try that too. Any other activities you’re interested in?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to go... um, shopping in... Gion? And maybe see geisha.

**Speaker A (NS):** Gion is a great idea! We can also check out the traditional shops and tea houses. How about transportation to Kyoto?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think shinkansen is good. It is fast. But... might be little expensive.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re right, the shinkansen can be pricey. What do you think about taking an express bus?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Express bus... it is good idea. Cheaper and not too slow.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let’s go with the express bus. When should we plan to meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** How about... um, nine o'clock in the morning?

**Speaker A (NS):** Nine a.m. works for me. Let’s meet at the station, then.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, station. Good plan. Thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! I’ll send the details to everyone. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** See you tomorrow! Have a good day!
