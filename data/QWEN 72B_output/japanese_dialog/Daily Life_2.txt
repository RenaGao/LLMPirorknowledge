**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, we’re going to be roommates for a while. What’s your favorite meal, and how do you usually prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** My favorite meal is um... it is called "donburi." It is rice bowl with different toppings.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Can you tell me more about how you make it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sure. First, I cook rice. I use Japanese short-grain rice. Then, um... I prepare some toppings. For example, I like to use chicken and vegetables.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great. What kind of vegetables do you use?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I use, um... carrot, onion, and sometimes... um, how to say... green beans?

**Speaker A (NS):** Green beans, yes! What do you do with the chicken?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I cut chicken into small pieces and then I cook it with soy sauce, mirin, and a little bit of sugar. I also add some ginger for flavor.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really flavorful! How do you put everything together?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I put the cooked rice in a bowl. Then, I add the chicken and vegetables on top. Sometimes, I add a little bit of um, how to say... grated daikon?

**Speaker A (NS):** Grated daikon, yes! And what about the sauce?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I make a sauce with soy sauce, mirin, and a little bit of dashi. I pour it over the toppings.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! Is there anything else you add to it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sometimes, I add a boiled egg on top. It is very delicious.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that’s a great meal! I’d love to try it sometime. Thanks for sharing, Sora!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome! I can make it for us sometime. How about this weekend?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect! I’m looking forward to it. Thanks, Sora!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No problem! See you this weekend. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Sora! Take care!
