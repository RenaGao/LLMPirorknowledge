**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aki! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi! I’m good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. What are your plans for this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... I don’t have plan. What about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking of planning a trip to a new city with some friends. Would you like to join us?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That sounds nice! Where are you thinking?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking of going to San Francisco. It’s a beautiful city with a lot of things to see.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. San Francisco, it famous for Golden Gate Bridge, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly! And there are a lot of other great places like Fisherman’s Wharf and Alcatraz Island.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, Alcatraz, I heard it is... um... what is word... prison?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it’s a former prison. It’s really interesting to visit.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That sounds interesting! And food, it good too?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! San Francisco has amazing food, especially seafood. There are lots of great restaurants and cafes.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, how we go there? By car?

**Speaker A (NS):** We could drive, but it’s also easy to take a train or a bus. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think train is good. Um, how long it take?

**Speaker A (NS):** The train ride is about 10 hours, but it’s a scenic route with beautiful views.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, 10 hours. That is long, but maybe it fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** It can be! We can bring some games or books to pass the time.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is good idea. I bring some snacks too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s meet at the train station early on Saturday morning, say around 8 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** 8 a.m., um, it early, but I can do. Okay, 8 a.m. at train station.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’m looking forward to it. See you then!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Me too! See you Saturday! Bye!
