**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Sora! How are you today? I heard you’re interested in learning a new skill. What skill are you thinking about learning?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello! I am good, thank you. Yes, I want to learn... um... cooking. How to say... traditional Japanese cooking.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! Why are you interested in learning traditional Japanese cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... because... I like to eat, of course, but also because it connect to culture. I want to know more about my own culture and share with other people.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a wonderful reason. Do you have any specific dishes in mind that you’d like to learn how to make?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to learn how to make... um... sushi and tempura. They are very popular, and I think they are not so easy to make.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sushi and tempura are definitely challenging but very rewarding to make. Have you tried making any Japanese dishes before?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I make miso soup and... um... okonomiyaki. They are ok, but I want to improve.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good start! Do you plan to take a class or teach yourself?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think I will watch some video on YouTube first. And maybe, um... find a class if I can.

**Speaker A (NS):** Watching videos is a great way to start. Do you have any favorite cooking channels?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not yet, but I will look for one. I hear there are many good ones.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Besides cooking, do you have any other hobbies or interests?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I like reading and... um... hiking. I enjoy being in nature.

**Speaker A (NS):** Hiking is a great way to relax. Any favorite spots you like to visit?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I like to go to... um... how to say... mountain near my home. It is peaceful and beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! How do you think learning to cook will impact your life?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think it will make me more... um... self-sufficient. And also, I can share my cooking with friends and family.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sharing your cooking is a wonderful way to bring people together. Do you have any plans to cook for someone soon?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to cook for my family when I visit them next month.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a lovely idea! I’m sure they’ll enjoy it. Well, it’s been great talking to you, Sora. Good luck with your cooking!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! It was nice talking to you, too. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Sora! Take care!
