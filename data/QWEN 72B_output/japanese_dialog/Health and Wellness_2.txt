**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! My name is Sarah. I'm your fitness trainer. How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello, Sarah. I am good. Thank you. My name is Aki.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you, Aki! What kind of exercise do you usually do?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I like running. I run three times a week. And also, I do some yoga.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Running and yoga are excellent choices. What are your fitness goals?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, I want to become more... more strong, and also, I want to lose some weight.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Building strength and losing weight are common goals. Have you tried any strength training before?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not really. I think it is, um, hard for me. I do not know how to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. We can start with some basic exercises. Do you have any specific areas you want to focus on?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I want to make my, um, arms and legs stronger.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. We can work on that. How about we start with some bodyweight exercises like push-ups and squats?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Push-ups and squats? Yes, I think I can do that. How many times should I do them?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let's start with three sets of 10 reps each. You can increase the reps as you get stronger. Does that sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that sounds good. And, um, how often should I do them?

**Speaker A (NS):** You can do them three times a week, on different days from your running days. That way, your muscles have time to rest and recover.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I understand. Thank you, Sarah.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! If you have any questions or need any help, feel free to ask. How are you feeling about this plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I am excited. I think it will be good for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's fantastic! I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's check in next week to see how you're doing. Sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that sounds good. Thank you again, Sarah.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Have a great day, Aki. See you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too. See you soon!
