**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sorry to hear that, Sora. Can you tell me more about the issue? For example, does it turn on, or does it show any error messages?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It turn on, but... um, very slow. And sometimes, it freeze and... um, how to say... show blue screen.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. A blue screen can be caused by different issues. Have you tried restarting your laptop to see if it helps?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I try many time. But still not good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let’s try a few more steps. Can you check if there are any updates available for your operating system?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, how to check updates?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, you can go to the ‘Settings’ app, then click on ‘Update & Security,’ and finally click on ‘Check for updates.’ Can you do that for me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let me know what it says.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** It say no updates available. What I do next?

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright. Let’s try running a system diagnostic. This can help identify any hardware issues. You can access it by pressing the ‘F12’ key when the laptop is starting up.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, F12... I try. (Pause) It show... menu. What I select?

**Speaker A (NS):** Select the option that says ‘Diagnostics’ or ‘Troubleshoot.’ It might be under a different name, but look for something similar.
