**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aki! Thanks for coming in today. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I wanted to discuss the project deadline with you. Can you tell me where we are with the current project?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, um, we are... how to say... almost finish. We are close to complete the main part of the project. But there is still some, um, checking to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear. When do you think we can have everything fully wrapped up?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think, um, one more week. We need to fix some small problem and do final test.

**Speaker A (NS):** Understood. The client has requested a final delivery by next Friday. Do you think that’s achievable?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, we can do it. But, um, we need to work, uh, overtime this week to make sure everything is perfect.

**Speaker A (NS):** I appreciate your dedication. Let’s make sure everyone on the team knows about the deadline. Have you updated the team on this?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I send email this morning. I tell everyone about the, uh, deadline and what they need to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Is there anything you need from me to help you meet the deadline?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I think we can manage. But, um, if there is any problem, I will let you know.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great. Let’s touch base daily to make sure everything is on track. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is good idea. I will keep you update.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, Aki. I have confidence in the team. We’ll make it happen.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. I am confident too. We work hard.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Well, let’s make sure we have a good final product. Have a good day, Aki. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too. See you tomorrow!
