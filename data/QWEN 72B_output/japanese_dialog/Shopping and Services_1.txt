**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! How’s it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello, Aki! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good too, thanks for asking. I’m thinking of buying a new camera. Do you have any recommendations?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, camera? Um, yes, I read some review. I think... um, Canon and Nikon are good. How you want to use it?

**Speaker A (NS):** I want to take some travel photos and maybe do a bit of videography. What do you think about that?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** For travel and video, maybe... um, mirrorless camera is better. It is not heavy and good for taking picture and video.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good point. I’ve heard the Sony Alpha series is really popular for that. Have you used one before?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I use Sony. It is... um, very clear picture and easy to use. But, it is little bit expensive.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What about the battery life? That’s important for travel.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sony camera have good battery, but... um, if you take many picture, maybe you need extra battery.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. On that note, what about the lenses? Are they easy to find?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, Sony have many lens. You can find them in shop or online. And, some lens are not so expensive.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great to know. What about the user interface? Is it intuitive?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is... um, easy to understand. Menu is clear, and you can change setting quickly.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really helpful, Sora. What about the image quality? How does it compare to other brands?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sony’s image quality is very good. It have good color and sharp picture. Some people say it is better than... um, other camera.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks for that. One last thing, do you have any advice for someone new to photography?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes. I think, practice is important. You need to... um, try different setting and see what work best. And, read manual also helps.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, practice makes perfect. Thanks so much for your advice, Sora!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome, Aki. I hope you find good camera.

**Speaker A (NS):** I will! Thanks again. See you later, Sora!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Goodbye, Aki! See you later!
