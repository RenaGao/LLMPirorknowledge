**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! How are you? Have you started preparing for the upcoming test?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi, Aki! I am good, thank you. Um, I started a little bit. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve been studying a bit too. Do you feel ready for it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not really. I am little nervous. How to say... I have trouble with the grammar section.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. What specifically is giving you trouble?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** The passive voice. I always forget when to use it.

**Speaker A (NS):** That can be tricky. One tip is to practice converting active sentences to passive. It helps to see the pattern.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I try that. Um, what you do to prepare?

**Speaker A (NS):** I usually make flashcards for the vocabulary and practice with past exam questions. It’s a good way to see what you know and what you need to work on.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Flashcards sound good. I will try. And past exam questions too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you want to study together sometime? It can be more effective and fun.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sure, I would like that. When is good for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about tomorrow afternoon? We can meet at the library.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That sound good. What time?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, 2 p.m. is fine. I will be there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! See you there. Anything else you want to ask about the test?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I think that covers it. Thank you for the tips, Aki.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Sora! Let’s do well on the test together. Good luck with your studying!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! Good luck to you too. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Bye, Sora!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Bye, Aki!
