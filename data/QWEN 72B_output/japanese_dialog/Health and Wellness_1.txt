**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Sora! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks for asking! So, I heard you've been feeling a bit run down lately. Any particular reason?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I have been, um, working a lot. And also, I think I not eating good food. Maybe that is why.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Getting enough rest and eating well are really important. Have you been able to get enough sleep?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I think I not sleep enough. I have to finish my, um, project for work.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Managing your time can be tough. Have you tried setting a specific time to go to bed each night?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not really. I think I should, um, try that. It might help.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good idea. Also, try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bed. It can really improve the quality of your sleep.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, I see. I will try to, um, turn off my phone and computer. Thank you for advice.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! And don't forget about your diet. Eating balanced meals can give you more energy.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I need to eat more vegetables and fruits. Maybe I can, um, prepare meals ahead of time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great plan. It can save you time and ensure you're eating healthy. How about hydration? Are you drinking enough water?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I, um, think I should drink more. I often forget.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's easy to forget. Maybe set reminders on your phone to drink water throughout the day.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Good idea! I will do that. Thank you so much for all the advice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Taking care of yourself is really important. If you have any more questions or need further tips, just let me know.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! I will try my best to follow your advice. Let's meet again soon to see how I am doing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds great! Take care, Sora. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, take care! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
