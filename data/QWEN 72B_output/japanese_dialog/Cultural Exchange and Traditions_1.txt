**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I heard you're from Japan. Can you tell me about some dining etiquette in Japan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes. In Japan, we have many rules for eating. For example, we say "itadakimasu" before eating and "gochisousama" after.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s interesting! What do those phrases mean?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** "Itadakimasu" means... um, "I receive" or "I am grateful for the food." And "gochisousama" means "thank you for the meal."

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What about things like using chopsticks?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, chopsticks are very important. We do not stick them upright in the rice because it looks like a funeral thing. And we do not pass food with chopsticks directly to another person's chopsticks.

**Speaker A (NS):** I didn’t know that. It’s good to be aware of these things. What about seating arrangements? Is there a specific way to sit?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** In some traditional places, we sit on the floor with cushions. The oldest or most important person usually sits in the seat of honor, which is farthest from the door.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very respectful. How about in Western countries? Do you find the dining etiquette different?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is different. In Western countries, people use more utensils like forks, knives, and spoons. And the seating arrangement is often around a table, not on the floor.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true. Is there anything else you find notably different?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, in Japan, we do not tip, but in many Western countries, tipping is expected. Also, in Japan, we often bring omiyage, which is a gift, when visiting someone’s home.

**Speaker A (NS):** Omiyage is a thoughtful gesture. It’s great to learn about these cultural differences. Thanks for sharing all this with me!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome! It is interesting to talk about different cultures.

**Speaker A (NS):** It really is. Well, I think that’s all for now. It was great talking to you. Take care!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you! Take care, too. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye!
