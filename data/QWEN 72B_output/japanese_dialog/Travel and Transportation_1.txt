**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m Alex. It’s nice to meet you. How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello, I’m Aki. Nice to meet you. I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I’m actually a bit lost. Do you know how to get to the Kyoto Hotel?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, Kyoto Hotel. Um, yes, I know where it is. It is not far from here. You walk... um, you go straight on this street for about five minutes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, and then what do I do?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Then, you turn... uh, right. Right at the big sign. It is easy to see. Big red sign.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, and how long after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** After turn, you walk maybe three minutes. Hotel is on your left. You will see it. It is big building.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, thanks so much. Is it safe to walk at night?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is safe. This area is very safe. Many people walk at night. You do not worry.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to know. What if I get lost or have any problems?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, if you get lost, you can ask people. They are friendly. Most people speak some English. Also, you can call hotel. They help you.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very reassuring. And is there anything else I should know about the area?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, there is small park near hotel. It is nice place for relaxing. And, um, many restaurants around. You can try Japanese food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great. Thank you for all the information, Aki. You’ve been really helpful.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome. I am glad to help. If you need more help, you can ask me. Good luck!

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you! Have a great day, Aki.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too. Take care! Bye-bye!
