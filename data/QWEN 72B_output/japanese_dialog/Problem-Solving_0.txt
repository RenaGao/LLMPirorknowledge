**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! Thanks for calling. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about what happened yesterday. I think there was a misunderstanding.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes, I think so too. I feel... how to say... a bit confused about what happened.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. I just wanted to explain that I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. When I said we should go to Kyoto, I was hoping you would be excited about it.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, I see. I thought you... um... prefer other places. I did not know you want to go to Kyoto.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s my favorite place! I was really hoping you would enjoy it too. I know you love historical places.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I do! I love Kyoto, but I thought you... you know, like bigger cities more.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. I should have been clearer. I just assumed you knew how much I enjoy visiting historic sites.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, maybe. But I also like... um... quiet places, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** I totally get that. We can definitely spend some time in the more peaceful areas too. How about we plan to visit some temples and gardens?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That sounds really nice! I would love that. Thank you for explaining.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I’m glad we cleared this up. So, are you still up for going together?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I am! I am really looking forward to it now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll send you the details about our trip. Can we meet at the station tomorrow morning?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sure, what time is good for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 9 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That works for me. See you then!

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! See you tomorrow!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you tomorrow! Take care!
