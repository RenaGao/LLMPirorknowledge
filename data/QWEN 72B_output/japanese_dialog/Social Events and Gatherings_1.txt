**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello! I am good. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! Hey, I have an idea. How about we plan a surprise party for our friend Tom?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, that is good idea! Um, how to say... sounds fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! When do you think we should have it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Let's see... How about this Saturday? It is... not too busy for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Saturday works for me too. What time should we start?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Maybe... around 7 p.m. It is good time, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect. Where should we have the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um... we can have it at my place. It is... big enough for everyone.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! Do you have a guest list in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I have. We can invite... um, how to say... our close friends. About 10 people, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. What about food and drinks?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I can make some Japanese food. And we can buy some drinks and snacks from the store.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Do you need any help with the food?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it would be great if you can help. We can... um, cook together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! That’ll be fun. What about decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We can use balloons and streamers. It is... simple but nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome. And we should probably send out invitations soon. How about we use a group chat to organize everything?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that is good idea. I will create the group chat.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s make sure everyone brings something to share. It will be a great party!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I think so too. Thanks for organizing this.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! It’s going to be a lot of fun. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you then! Thank you!
