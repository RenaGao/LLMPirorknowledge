**Scene: Planning a Team Meeting and Deciding on the Agenda**

**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aki! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello, Sora! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I was thinking about our team meeting next week. Do you have any ideas for the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, yes. We should talk about the project deadlines, I think. And also, um, how to say... team communication.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! Project deadlines and communication are important. Anything else you think we should include?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, maybe we can talk about the budget. And also, um, team building activity. It is good for morale, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, team building is a good idea. So, our agenda will include project deadlines, communication, budget, and a team building activity. Does that sound good to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that sounds good. Should we decide on a time for the meeting?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, when works for you? I'm available most of the week.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** How about Wednesday? After... um, lunch time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Wednesday afternoon works for me. How about 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, 2 p.m. is good. And where should we meet? In the conference room?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the conference room is perfect. I'll send out an email to the team with the details.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you, Sora. I will prepare for the meeting.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Aki. I appreciate your help. Looking forward to it!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Me too. See you on Wednesday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then. Take care!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You too. Bye!
