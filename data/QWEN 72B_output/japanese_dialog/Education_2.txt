**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! How's your day going?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello, Aki! My day is good, thank you. Um, how to say... I have question about homework.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’d be happy to help. What’s the question?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** The problem... um, it is about... how to calculate, um, tax rate.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. Can you show me the specific problem you’re having trouble with?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, it is, um... here. (Shows the problem) I not sure how to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. The first step is to identify the base amount and the tax rate. Can you tell me what those are in this problem?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** The base amount is... um, 200 dollars. And, um, tax rate is, um, 8 percent.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right. So, you need to multiply 200 by 0.08 to find the tax amount. Then, add that to the base amount to get the total.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, so... 200 times 0.08 is... um, 16 dollars. Then, 200 plus 16 is 216 dollars. Is that correct?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! That’s the total amount including tax. Do you understand the steps?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I understand. But, um, should I, um, write, um, explanation too?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. Yes, it’s a good idea to write out the steps. It will help you and the teacher understand your thought process.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. So, I write... base amount is 200 dollars, tax rate is 8 percent, tax amount is 16 dollars, and total amount is 216 dollars.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! That’s exactly what you should do. Is there anything else you’re unsure about?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** No, I think I got it. Thank you so much for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Have a great day, Sora!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you, Aki! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Sora! See you later!
