**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Aki! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello, Sora! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I was thinking, why don't we talk about some cultural differences in dining etiquette? I think it would be interesting to compare our customs.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sure, that sounds good! In Japan, we have many rules about eating. For example, we always say "itadakimasu" before we start eating and "gochisousama" after we finish.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's really nice. We don't have a specific phrase like that in English, but it's a beautiful tradition. What about using chopsticks? Are there any rules we should know?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, chopsticks are very important. We never point with them or stick them upright in our rice, because it is like a funeral ritual.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks for letting me know. In the U.S., we use knives and forks, and it's common to keep them on the plate until we're done. We also put the napkin on our lap.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, I see. In Japan, we also use a small plate called "o-zara" for our rice, and we place our chopsticks on a chopstick rest.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's interesting. Do you have any specific table manners for guests or special occasions?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, for guests, we often serve food on separate plates, and we make sure to offer them the best pieces. We also try to create a comfortable atmosphere.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's so considerate. In the U.S., we often pass dishes around the table and encourage everyone to take what they like. It's more about sharing and being hospitable.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I understand. It sounds very friendly. In Japan, we also have a custom called "shime," where we finish a meal with a light dish like a salad or a dessert.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great way to end a meal. In the U.S., we often have dessert, but it can be sweet or savory, depending on the occasion.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I like that too. It's fun to try different things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! It's always interesting to learn about different cultures. Thanks for sharing all this with me, Aki.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome, Sora. It was fun talking to you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let's do this again sometime. See you later!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you later! Take care!
