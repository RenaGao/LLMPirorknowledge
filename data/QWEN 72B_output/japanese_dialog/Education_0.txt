**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. So, I heard we have a big exam coming up next week. Are you feeling prepared?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, the exam. I feel... um, okay. I study a lot, but sometimes I worry about... um, the questions.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. What parts are you finding the most challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think... the math problems. They are hard for me. And also, the essay part. I not sure how to... um, how to say... write it good.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Have you tried practicing with past exam papers?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I practice, but I still make mistake. I think I need more help with... um, structure.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good point. Maybe we can study together? We can go over some practice questions and I can help you with structuring your essays.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That would be great! I think it will help me a lot. When is good for you?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this weekend? We can meet at the library on Saturday afternoon.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Saturday is good. What time?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, 2 p.m. is fine for me. I will bring my notes and some practice questions.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And I’ll bring some extra resources if you need them. Are you bringing a laptop?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I bring my laptop. It will be useful for... um, writing and checking things.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let’s make the most of our study time. I’m sure we’ll do well on the exam.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I hope so. Thank you for helping me, Sora. I really appreciate it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! We’re in this together. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** See you on Saturday! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Sora! Have a good day!
