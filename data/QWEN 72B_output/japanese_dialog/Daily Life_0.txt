**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sora! How's it going? I heard you have a pretty interesting morning routine. Can you tell me about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi, Aki! I am good, thanks. Um, my morning routine, it is... simple, but I like it. I wake up early, around six.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's pretty early! What do you do first?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** First, I... um, take shower. Then I do some stretch. Stretching help me feel good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great. Do you have a specific stretching routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I follow video on YouTube. It is... um, how to say... guide for morning stretch.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice! What do you do after stretching?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** After stretch, I make breakfast. I like to eat healthy in morning. Usually, I have... um, porridge with fruits and yogurt.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Do you have any particular fruit you like to add?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I add banana and blueberry. Sometimes, I use apple or pear too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Fantastic! What about after breakfast?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** After breakfast, I read book. I like to read news or... um, magazine. It help me start day with good information.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great way to stay informed. What about the rest of your morning?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Then, I check email and plan my day. I write down task in my planner.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really organized! Do you have any other morning rituals?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Not really, but sometimes I go for short walk in park near my house. It make me feel fresh.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful way to start the day. What about you, Aki? What’s your morning routine like?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Oh, I am curious! Can you tell me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! I usually wake up around seven. I make coffee and check my emails. Then I meditate for a bit. It helps me stay calm and focused.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That sound nice. I want to try meditation sometime.

**Speaker A (NS):** You should! It’s really helpful. So, are we still on for our trip to Kyoto tomorrow?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I am excited! We meet at the station, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! See you there at 9 a.m.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, see you then! Have a good day, Aki!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Sora! Bye!
