**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Sora! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking! Can you tell me about a tradition or festival from Japan?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Sure! Um, how to say... One of my favorite festival is called... uh, Hanami.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, Hanami! That’s the flower viewing festival, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, exactly! People go to park and see cherry blossom. It is very beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds lovely! What do people usually do during Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** People bring food and drink. Um, we have picnic under the cherry tree. And sometimes, there is music and dance.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so fun! What kind of food do you usually eat?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** We eat... um, how to say... bento. It is like, box with rice and different food. And also, we have sake and other drinks.

**Speaker A (NS):** Bento boxes sound delicious! Do you have any special events or activities during Hanami?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, sometimes there are special events. Like, um, lanterns at night. And some cities have big parade.

**Speaker A (NS):** Lanterns at night sound magical! Is there a particular city where Hanami is especially popular?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, Kyoto is famous for Hanami. Many people go there to see the best cherry blossom. And also, Tokyo is popular.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to visit Kyoto during Hanami someday! Is there anything else you’d like to share about the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, Hanami is not only about seeing flowers. It is about enjoying time with family and friends. It is very important in Japanese culture.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really nice. It sounds like a wonderful way to connect with loved ones. Thanks for sharing, Sora!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** You are welcome! I hope you can experience Hanami one day.

**Speaker A (NS):** I definitely will! Thanks again. Take care, and see you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you later! Thank you.
