**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aki! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hi, Sora! I am good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I was thinking we could plan a cultural event to share our traditions. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That is good idea! I like it. What kind of event you think?

**Speaker A (NS):** Maybe a festival where we can showcase different aspects of our cultures, like food, music, and traditional games. What do you think about that?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, festival is great! We can have food, like sushi and tempura. And, um... how to say... cultural performance?

**Speaker A (NS):** Cultural performances, like traditional dance or music, sound wonderful! We can also have a section for arts and crafts. Do you have any specific ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, for arts, we can have calligraphy. And, um... paper folding. Oh, origami!

**Speaker A (NS):** Origami is a perfect idea! We can even have a workshop where people can learn how to make simple origami.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, workshop is good. We can teach people, and they can make paper crane, nezumi, and other things.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fantastic! For the food, we could have a variety of Japanese dishes and maybe some from my culture too. How about some sushi and miso soup?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, sushi and miso soup. And we can have ramen and takoyaki as well.

**Speaker A (NS):** Takoyaki is a great addition! We can also have some traditional American dishes like apple pie or corn on the cob. What about the venue?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, we can use community center. It is big and have many room for activities.

**Speaker A (NS):** The community center sounds perfect! We’ll need to check the availability and book the space. When do you think we could have the event?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** How about next month? It is not too soon, and we have time to prepare.

**Speaker A (NS):** Next month works for me. We can start planning the details and send out invitations. I’m really excited about this!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Me too! It will be fun to share our culture with others.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Thanks for all your ideas, Aki. Let’s get started on the planning. See you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, see you soon! Arigatou!

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! Bye, Aki!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Bye, Sora!
