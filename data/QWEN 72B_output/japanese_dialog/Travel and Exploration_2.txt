**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there, you look like you might be a bit lost. Can I help you with something?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Ah, yes, thank you. I... um, I need to go to the... how to say... old temple. Do you know where it is?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I know where the old temple is. It’s called the Kiyomizu-dera. Is that the one you’re looking for?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, that’s right. How do I get there?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, you can take the bus from the main station. The number 206 bus will take you right there.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, where is the main station?

**Speaker A (NS):** The main station is just a short walk from here. It’s about a 10-minute walk. You can see the big red building from here. Do you see it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japa)nese:** Ah, yes, I see the red building. So, I go there, and then take the bus?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. When you get to the station, look for the bus stop with the sign that says "206" on it. The bus comes every 15 minutes.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Thank you. How long does it take to get to the temple?

**Speaker A (NS):** The bus ride takes about 30 minutes. Once you get off the bus, the temple is just a short walk uphill. There will be signs pointing the way.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Okay, I understand. Is it far to walk from the bus stop?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not too far, about a 5-minute walk. The path is pretty and you’ll enjoy the scenery.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** That sounds nice. Thank you so much for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Is there anything else you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, no, I think that’s it. I can do it now. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Have a great visit to the temple. It’s really beautiful.

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I heard it is very beautiful. I am looking forward to it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Enjoy your trip! Goodbye!

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Goodbye! Thank you very much.
