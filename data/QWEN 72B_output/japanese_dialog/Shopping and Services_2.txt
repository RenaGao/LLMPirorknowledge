**Speaker A (NS):** Hello, thank you for calling ABC Electronics Customer Service. My name is Emily. How can I assist you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Hello, Emily. My name is Sora. I have problem with new camera I buy last week.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sorry to hear that, Sora. Can you tell me more about the problem?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, when I take picture, sometimes it is... um, not clear. It is blurry.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Is the camera focusing properly before you take the picture?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I wait for focus, but still, some pictures are blurry.

**Speaker A (NS):** Have you tried cleaning the lens to see if that helps?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Yes, I clean lens. Not help.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, thank you for letting me know. Can you tell me the model number of the camera and when you purchased it?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Model is C-5000. I buy it last Tuesday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Is the camera still under warranty?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** I think so. It say in manual warranty is one year.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. We can definitely help with that. We’ll need to send it back for a check-up. Can you bring it to our nearest store, or would you prefer us to mail you a return label?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Um, how to say... return label is good. I live far from store.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can send you a return label. Do you have a preferred shipping method?

**Speaker B (L2, Japanese):** Regular mail is fine.
