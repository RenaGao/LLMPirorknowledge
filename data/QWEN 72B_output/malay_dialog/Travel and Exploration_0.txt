**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! How are you? Are you free this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi! I am good, thank you. Yes, I free this weekend. Why, you want to do something?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I was thinking we could plan a trip to a new city with our friends. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, that sound nice! Where you want to go?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking about visiting Kuala Lumpur. It has a lot of new places to explore. Have you been there before?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I never go. But I hear it is very nice. What we can do there?

**Speaker A (NS):** We can visit the Petronas Twin Towers, check out the Chinatown area, and maybe go to a nice restaurant. What do you like to do?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like to see the city, and maybe we can go to a museum? How about that?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! The National Museum there is really interesting. We can also visit some parks and maybe even a shopping mall.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, I like shopping. But we also can, um, how to say... take a walk in the park?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! There’s a beautiful park called KLCC Park near the Petronas Towers. It’s perfect for a relaxing walk.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That is good to know. We can plan to go there. When we want to meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about meeting at the city center at 10 a.m. on Saturday?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, 10 a.m. is good. Where we should meet exactly?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s meet at the entrance of the Petronas Towers. It’s easy to find and we can start from there.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will be there. We need to bring water and some snacks?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! Pack some water and light snacks. We’ll be walking a lot.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Alright, I will do that. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a great day, Farah!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Bye-bye!
