**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi, I am good, thank you. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I was thinking, have you ever thought about planning a cultural event to share your traditions with others?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes, I have think about it. It is good idea. What you suggest we do?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, we could start with a traditional Malay dance performance. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, that is nice. We can do... how to say... the Joget dance. It is fun and colorful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! We could also have a food stall. Any traditional dishes you’d like to include?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we can have Nasi Lemak, it is very popular. And also, uh, Satay. People like it a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! How about some traditional games? Do you have any in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we can have, um... Congkak. It is game with small wooden board and shells.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! We could also have a craft station where people can learn to make traditional items. Any ideas for that?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we can teach how to make Bunga Telur, it is decoration made from eggshells. And also, um, Batik painting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Fantastic! One more thing, we should have some informational posters to explain the significance of these traditions.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is good idea. We can write about history and culture of Malaysia.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. We can also have a small speech or presentation to kick off the event. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, I can give speech. I will talk about, um, the importance of culture and tradition in Malay society.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect. We should start planning the logistics soon. When and where do you think we should have this event?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** How about next month, at the community center? It is big place and easy to find.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds great! Let’s meet next week to finalize the details, how does that sound?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is fine. Next week, same time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, same time. Thanks for all your ideas, Farah. I’m really excited about this event!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Me too! Thank you for inviting me. See you next week!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Take care!
