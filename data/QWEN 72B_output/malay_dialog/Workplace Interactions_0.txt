**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi Aiman! I am fine, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good, thanks. We have a project deadline coming up this Friday. Have you started on your part?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I start already. But, um, I have some problem with the data entry.

**Speaker A (NS):** What kind of problems are you facing?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** The data, it is not, um, how to say... not organize well. I think I need help to clean it.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Why don’t we sit down and go through it together? Maybe I can spot what’s causing the issue.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that will be good. When we can meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this afternoon? Around 2 p.m. in the conference room?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** 2 p.m. is fine for me. Should I bring my laptop?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, bring your laptop and any notes you have. We’ll figure it out together.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, thank you. Um, do you think we can finish it by Friday?

**Speaker A (NS):** I believe so. We just need to focus and work efficiently. If we need extra time, we can ask for an extension, but let’s try our best to meet the deadline.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I agree. I will try my best. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Farah. I’ll see you at 2 p.m. in the conference room. Let’s do this!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** See you then. Thank you, Aiman. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Farah! Talk to you later.
