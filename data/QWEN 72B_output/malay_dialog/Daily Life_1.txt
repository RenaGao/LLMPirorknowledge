**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi, I am fine. Thank you. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm good, thanks! Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, not yet. What about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking of planning a picnic with my family. Would you like to join us?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, that sounds nice! I like picnic. Where you plan to go?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking of the park near the lake. It’s always so peaceful there.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I know that place. Very beautiful. What time we go?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about we meet at 11 a.m. at the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Eleven o'clock, okay. Um... what we bring?

**Speaker A (NS):** We can bring a blanket, some snacks, and maybe some games. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, good idea. I can bring... um, how to say... thing for eating. Sandwiches?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Sandwiches sound great. And we can share some of the other snacks too.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I will make sandwich. Anything else?

**Speaker A (NS):** It would be nice to have some drinks. Maybe some juice or water?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I bring juice. And also, um... what about umbrella? In case rain.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! We’ll bring an umbrella just in case. And if it’s sunny, we can use it for shade.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is good. I think we have everything. See you at park?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, see you at the park! Have a good day, Farah!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! See you later!
