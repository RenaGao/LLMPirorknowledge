**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Welcome to our store. How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, good afternoon. I look for... um, how to say... thing for fixing paper.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you mean a stapler?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes! Stapler. I need stapler. Can you show me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Follow me, please. We have a variety of staplers. Some are for heavy-duty use, and others are for everyday tasks. What kind do you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I need one for office work. Not too big, but strong enough for many papers.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! This one is perfect for office use. It’s not too bulky and can handle up to 20 sheets at once. Would you like to try it out?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I try. *tries the stapler* It good. But, price?

**Speaker A (NS):** This one is priced at $15. We also have a slightly more affordable option for $10, but it’s a bit smaller. Do you want to see that one too?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, please show me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Here it is. This one is more compact and costs $10. It’s great for everyday use but can handle up to 10 sheets at once.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think... um, I choose the second one. It is enough for my work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent choice! Would you like anything else? We have a wide range of office supplies.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I think that is all. Thank you for helping me.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! It’s my pleasure. Is there anything else you need assistance with today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I think I am good. Thank you a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Have a wonderful day. If you need anything in the future, don’t hesitate to come back.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Take care.
