**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Farah! How’s it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. Got any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, nothing yet. Why you ask?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking about going out on Saturday evening. Want to join me?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure! That sound fun. Where you want to go?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about we try that new restaurant downtown? I heard it’s pretty good.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, the one everyone talk about? Yes, I heard it too. What they serve?

**Speaker A (NS):** They have a great selection of international dishes. Maybe we can try the new fusion menu?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Fusion menu? What is it?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s a mix of different cuisines, like combining Asian and Western flavors. It’s really unique.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, that is interesting. I like to try new food. Um, what time we should meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 7 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** 7 p.m. is good. And after that, we want to do something else?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, we could catch a movie. Is there anything you’ve been wanting to see?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to see the new action movie. Everyone say it is amazing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! Let’s check the schedule and book the tickets in advance.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is good idea. I will book the tickets.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect. I’ll confirm the restaurant reservation too. Looking forward to it!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Me too! Thank you for inviting me. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! See you then. Have a good day, Farah!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Bye!
