**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah! How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi Aiman, I am fine. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good, thanks. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about what happened at the party last weekend. I feel like there might have been a misunderstanding.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes. I also want to talk about that. I think... um, it was a bit of a problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** I noticed you seemed upset when I mentioned the game. I didn’t mean to upset you. Can you tell me what happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, um... when you said the teams, I felt like I was not chosen. It make me feel a bit left out.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’m really sorry about that. I didn’t realize how it came across. I just wanted to make sure everyone had a fun group to play with.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I know, but you know, in Malay culture, it is important to include everyone, even if they are not the best player.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. I should have been more mindful of that. I really value our friendship, Farah, and I don’t want anything to come between us.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I value our friendship too. I think we can solve this. How about next time, we can pick teams together, so everyone feels included?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! I’ll make sure to do that. I really appreciate you talking to me about this.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No problem, Aiman. We are friends, right? We should always be honest with each other.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Thanks for being so understanding. Can we still hang out this weekend? Maybe go to the mall and grab some food?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that sounds good! I am free this weekend.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! How about we meet at 11 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Eleven a.m. is fine. See you then!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Thanks again for talking things through. Talk to you later!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too, Aiman. Bye!
