**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah, how’s it going? I was thinking about something interesting. Do you want to chat about cultural differences in dining etiquette?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, hi! I good. Yes, can. It is... um, interesting topic.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, in Malaysia, what’s considered polite when you’re eating with others?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** In Malaysia, we use... um, how to say... we use our right hand when eating. It is... very important.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, that’s right! Using the right hand is important. Do you know why?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, because... um, left hand is for... um, cleaning. So, we use right hand for eating and giving thing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! That’s a big part of the culture. What about sitting arrangements? Are there any specific rules?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, usually elder people sit first. And, um, guest sit in... um, special chair. It show respect.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. In the U.S., we don’t have as many strict rules, but we do have some customs. For example, it’s polite to keep your hands on the table, but not your elbows.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I see. In Malaysia, we also keep hand on table, but not elbow. It is... polite.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right! Another thing is that in the U.S., it’s common to leave a tip for the server, usually about 15% to 20% of the bill.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I know. In Malaysia, we also leave tip, but not as much. Maybe 10%.

**Speaker A (NS):** Interesting! How about using utensils? Do you have specific rules for that?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we use... um, fork and spoon. We do not use knife much. Fork for... um, push food to spoon.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good point. In the U.S., we use a knife and fork together. The fork is held in the left hand and the knife in the right.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I see. Different way, but both can... um, work.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! It’s fascinating to learn about these differences. Do you have any other dining etiquette tips for visitors to Malaysia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, it is good to... um, how to say... not waste food. And, if you are finish, you say "saya dah habis" to show you finish eating.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really helpful! Thanks for sharing all this, Farah. It’s been a great conversation.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You are welcome. I... um, glad to help. See you later!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later! Take care!
