**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah, how are you? Do you have a minute to chat about the upcoming test?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi Aiman! Yes, I have time. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm good, thanks. So, have you started studying for the test yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not really. I am a bit... um, how to say... scare about it. It is big test, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, it’s a big one. But don’t worry, we can study together. That might help.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, that sound good! What do you think we should do first?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, we can start by reviewing the key chapters and making notes. Then we can practice with some past test papers.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think that is good idea. But, I have problem with understanding some of the... um, concepts. Like, the one about photosynthesis.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, photosynthesis can be tricky. Let’s break it down step by step. We can use diagrams to help visualize it.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, diagram is good. That help me a lot. And, we also need to memorize some formulas, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We can make flashcards for the formulas and review them regularly. That way, they’ll stick in your memory better.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Flashcard, yes. I like that. We can also discuss the questions we find difficult, so we can understand them better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! When do you want to meet to study?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** How about tomorrow after class? In the library?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let’s meet in the library at 3 p.m. Can you bring the past test papers?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, I can bring. And I will bring my notes too. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow, Farah! Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too, Aiman! Bye!
