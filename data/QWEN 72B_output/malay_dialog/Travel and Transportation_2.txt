**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah, how are you? Got any plans for the upcoming long weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi Aiman! I’m good, thanks. Not really, how about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could plan a group vacation. Any ideas on where we could go?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, how about we go to the beach? I think it is nice. Maybe Langkawi?

**Speaker A (NS):** Langkawi sounds great! It’s a beautiful place. What kind of activities do you want to do there?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like to go um... to the beach, of course. And we can do the cable car, right? It is very famous.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! The cable car is amazing. We could also try some water sports. What do you think about that?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I like that. Maybe we can um... do snorkeling or jet ski?

**Speaker A (NS):** Snorkeling sounds like a lot of fun. We could also explore the islands and maybe go to the turtle sanctuary.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ooh, turtle sanctuary! That is good. I want to see the turtles.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! How about we stay at a resort with a nice pool and good food?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I like that. Maybe we can find a place near the beach too?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! We can check some places online later and decide. What days are you free?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think I am free from Friday to Sunday. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here. So, let’s plan to leave on Friday and come back on Sunday?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is good. We can start packing soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan! I’ll look at some options for flights and hotels. We can meet up and finalize everything over the weekend.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay! I will wait for your message. Thanks, Aiman.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Farah. It’s going to be a lot of fun. See you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, see you soon! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Farah! Take care!
