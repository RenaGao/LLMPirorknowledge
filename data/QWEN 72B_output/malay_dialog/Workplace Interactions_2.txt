**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Farah! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I wanted to talk to you about planning a team meeting. Do you have any ideas on when we should schedule it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, how to say... next week maybe? Perhaps Wednesday or Thursday?

**Speaker A (NS):** Wednesday or Thursday sound good. How about Wednesday at 2 p.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** 2 p.m. is fine. That work for me. What we need to talk about in the meeting?

**Speaker A (NS):** We should cover a few things. First, I want to go over the project updates. Then, we can discuss the upcoming client presentations. Do you have any other topics to add?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, um, we can talk about the new marketing strategy. And also, maybe some team building activities?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great ideas! We can definitely include those. How about we start with project updates, then move on to the client presentations, followed by the marketing strategy, and end with team building activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sounds good to me. We need to send out the agenda to everyone too, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. I’ll draft the agenda and send it out later today. Do you want to help with that?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, I can help. Just tell me what to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll share the draft with you, and we can review it together. Also, do you have any suggestions for the team building activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, we can have a quiz night or maybe go for some outdoor activity, like a picnic?

**Speaker A (NS):** Those are great suggestions! Let’s add them to the list. Thanks, Farah. You’ve been really helpful.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You welcome! I am glad to help. See you on Wednesday then?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, see you on Wednesday. Have a great day, Farah!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Goodbye!
