**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah, how are you? How’s the preparation for the upcoming exam going?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, hello! I am good, thank you. Um, preparation, it... it okay, but I need more time to, um, study. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to hear. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. There’s so much to cover.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I know. Exam, it is, um, difficult. What subject you find hardest?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely the math section. All those formulas and problem-solving. How about you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** For me, it is... um, how to say... the essay writing. I need to practice more to improve my, um, grammar and vocabulary.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can totally relate to that. Writing essays can be tough. Have you been to any study groups or tutoring sessions?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I join study group with some friends. It help a lot. We discuss, um, the topics together. What about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. I haven’t joined any yet, but I might look into it. Maybe we can study together sometime?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is good idea! We can, um, share notes and, uh, practice problems together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! When do you think a good time would be?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, how about, um, Friday afternoon? After class?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good to me. What time works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Let’s meet, um, four o’clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Four o’clock works. Where do you want to meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, how about the library? It is quiet and, um, good for study.

**Speaker A (NS):** The library sounds perfect. I’ll bring some practice problems and we can go over them together.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is, um, very helpful. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Farah. I’m looking forward to it. Good luck with your studies!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! Same to you. See you Friday.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Bye, Farah.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Bye, take care!
