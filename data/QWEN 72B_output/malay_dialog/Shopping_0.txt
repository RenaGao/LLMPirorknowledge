**Scene: A native English speaker (NS) is shopping and needs help finding a product. They approach a Malay-speaking shop assistant (L2) for assistance.**

**Speaker A (NS):** Excuse me, can you help me find something?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, of course! What you look for?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m looking for a new charger for my phone. Do you have any in stock?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we have. What kind of phone you have?

**Speaker A (NS):** I have an iPhone 12.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, iPhone 12. Let me check. One moment, please.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, no problem. Thanks.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** (Returns) Here, we have this one. It is compatible with your phone. You want to take a look?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, can I see it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Of course. (Hands over the charger) This is the charger. It is... um, fast charging, yes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great. And how much is it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It is thirty-five ringgit.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thirty-five ringgit, okay. Do you have any other options, maybe a bit cheaper?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we have another one. (Points to another charger) This one is, um, twenty-five ringgit. It is good quality too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Let me see that one as well, please.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure. (Hands over the second charger) Here you go. It is twenty-five ringgit.

**Speaker A (NS):** This one looks good. I’ll take it. Can you also show me where the power banks are?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, sure. Follow me. (Leads the way) Here are the power banks. Which one you like?

**Speaker A (NS):** This one looks nice. How much is it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** This one is forty ringgit.

**Speaker A (NS):** Forty ringgit, okay. I’ll take that one too. Thank you so much for your help.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You welcome! Anything else you need?

**Speaker A (NS):** No, that’s all. Thank you again.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No problem. Have a good day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too. Goodbye!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Goodbye!
