**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Aiman, how are you? I was thinking about planning a surprise party for our friend, Farah. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, Farah! She very nice. I think surprise party is good idea, yes. Um... how to say... it will be fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Do you have any ideas for a good venue?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm... we can use my place. It have big room, and we can decorate easily.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! When do you think would be a good time to have the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe next Saturday? Um, the eighteenth. Farah not have work then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll check with the others. What about the theme? Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Farah like... um... movies, yes. We can have movie party! Everyone bring their favorite movie.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! We can set up a projector and screen for a mini movie theater. What about food and drinks?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We can make... um... some snacks and drinks. How to say... finger food, yes. And maybe some cocktails?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! We can split the tasks. I can handle the snacks and drinks, and you can take care of the decorations?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I can do that. We also need to invite the others. How to send the invitation?

**Speaker A (NS):** We can make a group chat and send out the details there. I’ll draft a message and everyone can confirm their attendance.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Good idea. Um... can you remind me about the time? When we should start?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Let’s start around 7 p.m. That gives everyone time to get ready and arrive.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, 7 p.m. is good. Um... one more thing. We need to keep it secret from Farah, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! We’ll have to be careful not to let anything slip. Thanks for your help, Aiman!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No problem! I am excited. Um... let’s make it a great party for Farah.

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed! Thanks again. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Talk to you soon! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Aiman! See you at the party!
