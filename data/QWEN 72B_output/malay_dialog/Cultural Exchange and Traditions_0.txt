**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi, I am good. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I was wondering if you could tell me about a tradition or festival from your culture.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, sure! I can tell about Hari Raya Aidilfitri. It is very important festival for us.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! Could you explain what it is and why it’s important?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, Hari Raya Aidilfitri is end of Ramadhan. Ramadhan is month where we fast from sunrise to sunset. Um... it is joyful time for us.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear! What do people usually do during Hari Raya Aidilfitri?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We usually wear traditional clothes, like baju kurung. We go to mosque for special prayer, and after that, we visit family and friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lovely way to celebrate. Do you have any special foods during this time?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we have many special foods. Um... like ketupat, which is rice wrapped in leaves. And alsoabcdayam lemak, it is spicy rice with chicken.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ketupat and nasi lemak sound delicious! Do you have any other traditions or customs?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we also give gifts and money to children, called duit raya. It is way to show love and care.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a wonderful tradition. How do you prepare for the festival?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We clean our house, buy new clothes, and prepare food. We also decorate our house with lights and flowers.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a lot of effort, but very worth it. Do you have any specific memories from celebrating Hari Raya Aidilfitri?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I remember when I was young, we all gather at my grandparents’ house. We pray together, eat together, and play games. It is very happy time for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a beautiful memory. It sounds like a really meaningful and joyful celebration.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, it is. I miss those times now. How about you? Do you have any special traditions in your culture?

**Speaker A (NS):** We have Thanksgiving, which is a time when families come together to give thanks and eat a big meal. It’s a lot like Hari Raya in that way.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, that is nice! I would like to experience it one day.

**Speaker A (NS):** You should! It’s a lot of fun. Thanks for sharing about Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Farah. It was really interesting to learn about it.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You are welcome! I am glad you find it interesting. We should keep in touch and maybe celebrate our traditions together some day.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! Take care, Farah. See you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** See you soon! Bye!
