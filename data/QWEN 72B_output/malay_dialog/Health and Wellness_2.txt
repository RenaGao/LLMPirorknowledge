**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! Thanks for coming today. How have you been?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, how’s your exercise routine been going lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, it is good. I exercise... how to say... twice week. I go to gym and do some running.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Do you have any specific fitness goals in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to be more fit, and maybe lose some weight. I also want to have more strength.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent goals! What kind of exercises do you enjoy the most?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like running and doing some weight lifting. But, um... I need to improve my, how to say, form?

**Speaker A (NS):** Form, yes! Proper form is really important to avoid injuries. Have you tried any new exercises recently?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not yet, but I want to try yoga. I hear it is good for flexibility and balance.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yoga is a great choice! It can really help with both flexibility and balance. Have you ever done any yoga before?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I never try. But I think I want to start. Maybe you can help me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! We can start with some basic poses and build up from there. How about we schedule a session next week to try it out?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That would be good! I can come Wednesday afternoon?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Wednesday afternoon works for me. What time suits you best?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** How about three o'clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Three o'clock sounds great! I’ll see you then. Are you looking forward to it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, very much! Thank you for helping me.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Farah! Have a great day, and I’ll see you next Wednesday at three.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okey, see you then! Thank you!
