**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah, what are you up to this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi Aiman! Um, I don’t have anything special. Why, what you have in mind?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking about checking out the new mall in the city. Do you want to come with me?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! I heard it very nice. What we can do there?

**Speaker A (NS):** They say there are a lot of new stores, and the food court is really big. We could grab some lunch there and maybe watch a movie.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sounds good! We can eat there. After that, we watch movie?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! What movie are you interested in?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hmm, I think new movie, you know, the one everyone talking about.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. We can check the schedule later and see what times are available. How about we meet at 10 in the morning?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, 10 o’clock is good. But, um, don’t forget buy tickets early.

**Speaker A (NS):** No worries, I’ll take care of it. So, everything is set?
