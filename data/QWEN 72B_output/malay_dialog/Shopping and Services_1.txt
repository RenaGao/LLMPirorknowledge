**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How to say... I am thinking about buying new laptop. You can help me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, Farah! What kind of laptop are you looking for? Something for work or for fun?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um... for work. I need it for my study and project.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. What are the most important features for you? Like the size, battery life, or processing power?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I need it small, and battery must be long. And... how to say... it must be fast.

**Speaker A (NS):** Makes sense. So, a lightweight laptop with good battery life and a fast processor. Any budget in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Budget... I think around one thousand... um, dollars.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a reasonable budget. Have you checked any specific models?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I look at some. But I not sure... how to choose.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. What about the brand? Do you prefer a specific one?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I like... um... Apple. But I think it is too expensive. Maybe... how to say... Dell or HP?

**Speaker A (NS):** Dell and HP are both good choices. They offer good value for their price. Have you checked the reviews?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I look at some, but I not sure. Can you give me advice?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! For your needs, I would recommend a Dell XPS 13 or an HP Spectre x360. Both are lightweight, have great battery life, and are within your budget.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I see. Can you tell me more about... um... the HP one?

**Speaker A (NS):** Certainly! The HP Spectre x360 is a very versatile laptop. It has a 2-in-1 design, so you can use it as a tablet. It also has a fast processor, long battery life, and a high-resolution screen.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That sounds good. And the price?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s usually around a thousand dollars, depending on the configuration. You can check it out online or at a store.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you so much! I will look at it today. Maybe I buy it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! If you need any more help, just let me know. Enjoy your new laptop!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I will tell you if I buy it. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Good luck, Farah! Talk to you later! Bye!
