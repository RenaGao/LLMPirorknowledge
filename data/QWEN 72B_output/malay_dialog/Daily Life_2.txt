**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah! How are you settling in with the new place?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi Aiman! I am good, thank you. The place nice. I like it. How you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, I was thinking, do you have a favorite meal you like to cook? Maybe we can make it together sometime.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, yes! I like to cook nasi lemak. It is very yummy. You want to try?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'd love to! Can you tell me how you prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, um... I start with coconut milk. First, I boil water and add coconut milk. Then, I put rice in.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. So, you mix the rice and coconut milk together while it's boiling?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, and I add pandan leaf. It give nice flavor. Then, I cook it in rice cooker for one hour.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds easy enough. What about the side dishes?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** For side, I make sambal. I blend red chili, garlic, and onion. Then, I fry it with a bit of oil and tamarind.

**Speaker A (NS):** Mmm, that sounds delicious. Do you add any vegetables?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I use cucumber and egg. Sometimes, I add peanuts too. It is very, very good.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! Do you have any tips for making the sambal not too spicy?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, you can use less chili. Or, you can take out the seeds. It will be less spicy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks for the tip! When should we plan to make this?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** How about Saturday? It is good day for cooking.

**Speaker A (NS):** Saturday sounds perfect. We can start in the morning, so everything is fresh.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, morning is good. We can have lunch together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I'm looking forward to it. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Farah.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You welcome! I am happy to cook with you. See you Saturday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Bye, Farah!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Bye, Aiman!
