**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Farah! It’s great to chat with you. Can you tell me about a traditional festival from your country?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, hello! Yes, sure. Um, one of the most important festival in Malaysia is Hari Raya Aidilfitri. It is very special for Muslims.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting. Can you explain what it is?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure. Hari Raya Aidilfitri, we call it Raya. It is to celebrate the end of fasting month, Ramadhan. People fast for one month, and after that, we have big celebration.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fascinating! What do people usually do during this celebration?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We do many things. Um, people go to mosque for prayer, and after that, we visit family and friend. We wear new clothes, and we give gift. Also, we have special food, like ketupat and rendang.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ketupat and rendang sound delicious! Can you tell me more about these dishes?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ketupat is rice cook in coconut leaf, and rendang is meat cook with coconut milk and spices. It is very yummy.

**Speaker A (NS):** They definitely sound yummy! Are there any other customs or traditions during Raya?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, um, we also do something called "open house." It is when people open their house for visitor, and everyone can come to eat and celebrate together. It is very fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful way to celebrate. How do people prepare for it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We clean house, decorate with lights and flowers. We buy new clothes, and we prepare food. It take many days to prepare, but it is worth it.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a lot of effort, but very rewarding. Do non-Muslims join in the celebrations too?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, many non-Muslims join too. It is very welcoming. They come to open house, bring gift, and celebrate together. It is good for community.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really heartwarming. Thanks for sharing all this with me, Farah. It’s been great learning about Raya.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You are welcome! I happy to share. If you ever come to Malaysia, you should experience it yourself!

**Speaker A (NS):** I would love to! Thank you again, Farah. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Bye-bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Farah!
