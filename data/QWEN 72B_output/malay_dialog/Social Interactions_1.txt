**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Farah! How are you doing? You want to catch up on plans for Ali's birthday surprise?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi! I am good, thank you. Ali's birthday surprise? Yes, I want to talk about it. How to start, lah?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! First, we need to decide on a date and time. What day is Ali's birthday?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ali's birthday is this Saturday. Um, how about we start the surprise at 7 p.m.?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! So, where do you think we should have the party?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think we can have it at his house. His place big and we have space for everyone.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Do you know how many people are coming?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I check with a few friends. I think about 20 people will come.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! What about the decorations? Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I want to make it colorful. We can use balloons and streamers. Maybe some banners too?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a fantastic idea! And what about food and drinks?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I can bring some kuih and snacks. We can also order some pizza and drinks from the nearby restaurant.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome! We should also think about a birthday cake. Do you have any preferences?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think Ali likes chocolate cake. Maybe we can get a chocolate one?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect choice! What about games or activities? Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We can play some games like musical chairs and pass the parcel. It will be fun for everyone.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a lot of fun! And what about a present? Should we pool money for one big gift?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think that is good. We can buy something special for him, like a new book or a gadget.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! Let's send out the invitations and confirm everything by tomorrow. Does that sound good to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, it sounds good! Thank you for helping with the planning.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all, Farah! Looking forward to seeing Ali's face on Saturday. Talk to you later!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, see you then! Bye-bye!
