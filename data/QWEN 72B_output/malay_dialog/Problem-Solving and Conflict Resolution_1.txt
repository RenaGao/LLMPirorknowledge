**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I heard you're having some issues with your internet connection?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, it is... um... slow. Sometimes it just stop working. I don't know what to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really frustrating. Have you tried restarting your router?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I try, but it not help much. It same after.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, have you called your service provider yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not yet. I think maybe they can come to check it, but I not sure.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good idea. They might be able to diagnose the problem better on-site. When was the last time you called them?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It have been long time. Maybe six month.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. It might be a good idea to call them now. What’s the name of your service provider?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** It is... um... how to say... Maxis.

**Speaker A (NS):** Maxis, right. Do you have their customer service number handy?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think I have. Let me see... yes, it is 12345.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. When do you think would be a good time to call them?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Maybe this afternoon, after I finish work. Around 5 o'clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good. If they can’t solve it over the phone, they might send a technician to your place.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is what I hope. I will call them and see what they say.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! If you need any help, just let me know. I can even call with you if you want.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That is very nice of you. I think I can do it. But if I have problem, I will ask you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! No problem at all. Good luck, and I hope they can fix it soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you very much. I will tell you how it go.

**Speaker A (NS):** I look forward to hearing from you. Have a good day, Farah!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! See you later!
