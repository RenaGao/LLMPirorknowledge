**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Aiman! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I wanted to ask you about the homework assignment. Could you help me clarify something?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Of course, I can try. What is the problem?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm a bit confused about the essay topic. It says we need to write about a cultural tradition, but it doesn’t specify which one. Do you have any suggestions?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, how to say... You can choose any cultural tradition. It is up to you. Maybe you can write about a tradition from your own country?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. Do you have any specific traditions in Malaysia that you think would be interesting to write about?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, we have many interesting traditions. For example, we have “Raya” celebration. It is big festival for Muslims. We have special food, and we visit family and friend.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that sounds fascinating! What kind of special food do you have during Raya?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** We have “rendang,” which is a spicy meat dish. And also “ketupat,” which is rice cooked in coconut leaves. Very yummy!

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that sounds delicious! I’d love to try it someday. Do you think I could write about Raya in my essay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Definitely! That is a great topic. You can talk about the food, the customs, and how people celebrate.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really helpful, Aiman. Thank you so much for your suggestions. Do you have any tips on how to structure the essay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure. You can start with introduction about Raya, then describe the celebration, and then talk about the food and traditions. Maybe you can include some personal stories too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll keep that in mind. One last thing—do you know if there are any specific readings or sources I should look at?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You can check the library or look online. There are many articles and books about Raya. I can also share some links if you want.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be fantastic. Thank you, Aiman. You’ve been a big help.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No problem! I am happy to help. Good luck with your essay.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks again. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Bye for now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Aiman!
