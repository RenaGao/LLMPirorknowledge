**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Farah, how are you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good too, thanks for asking. Sorry, I wanted to talk to you about something. I made a mistake with the ticket booking for the movie.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, really? How to say... What mistake?

**Speaker A (NS):** I accidentally booked the tickets for the wrong time. I booked them for 10 a.m. instead of 2 p.m. I know we planned for the afternoon.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I see. No problem, can you change the time?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I can. I’ll call the cinema and try to get the 2 p.m. tickets. I should be able to fix it.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That is good. Thank you. How to say... Can you also check if the new filem, the one everyone talks about, is playing then?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I’ll check the schedule to make sure it’s playing at 2 p.m. I’ll call them right now and get back to you.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, thank you. I will wait for your message.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll let you know as soon as I have an update. I’m really sorry for the inconvenience.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, it is okay. Mistakes happen. I appreciate you fixing it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks for understanding, Farah. I’ll make sure it’s all sorted out.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, no worries. Talk to you soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** Talk to you soon. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too, bye!
