**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Farah! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi Aiman! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. We have a bit of an issue at work that we need to address. Have you heard about the new project deadlines?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, yes, I hear about it. The deadline is soon, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right. It’s coming up in two weeks. I was thinking we could work on a plan to meet it. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think it is good idea. We need to... um, make sure everything is ready on time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Let’s start by breaking down the tasks. Can you list some of the main tasks we need to complete?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure. We need to finish the report, and also, um, update the database. We need to, um, check the data.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, those are important tasks. We also need to finalize the presentation and get all the necessary approvals.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, and we need to, um, send the final report to the manager for review.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right. Let’s assign tasks. How about you take care of the database and data checking?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I can do that. You will do the report?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I’ll work on the report and the presentation. We can meet mid-week to review our progress and make any necessary adjustments.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That sounds good. We meet, um, Wednesday?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, let’s meet on Wednesday at 2 p.m. in the conference room.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, 2 p.m. in the conference room. I will, um, send a reminder.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. And I’ll start on the report today. Thanks for your help, Farah.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No problem, Aiman. We can do this. See you Wednesday.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then. Take care!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too. Bye!
