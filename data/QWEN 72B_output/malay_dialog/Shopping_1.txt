**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m really interested in that beautiful handicraft. How much is it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, hello! That one? Um, how to say... Sembilan puluh ringgit. Ninety ringgit.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ninety ringgit? That’s a bit steep for me. Can we negotiate?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, we can talk. Um, you want... how much?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking more along the lines of sixty ringgit. Is that possible?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sixty? It little bit... um, low. I pay much for material. But, okay, I give you seventy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Seventy is still a bit high. How about sixty-five?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sixty-five... okay, I think can. But, you buy now, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** I would, but I’m not sure. Can you hold it for me until tomorrow? I’ll come back then.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, I can hold. But, you come tomorrow, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I will. I promise.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Good. I wait for you. What time you come?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll be here around 10 a.m. Is that okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ten? Yes, ten is good. I open shop pukul sembilan.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, see you at 10 a.m. Thanks for holding it for me!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You welcome! Jumpa nanti!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Have a good day!
