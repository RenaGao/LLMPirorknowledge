**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hello, I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I was thinking, it might be interesting to talk about dining etiquette. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that is good idea. Um... in Malaysia, we have some... how to say... rules for eating.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right! Could you tell me more about them?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure. In Malaysia, we use... um, fork and spoon. Fork for pushing food, and spoon for eating.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's interesting. In many Western countries, we use both fork and knife. Do you use your hands for certain dishes?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, for some... how to say... traditional food. Like nasi lemak or roti canai. We use our right hand.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I see. It's always the right hand, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, always right hand. Left hand is... um, not clean.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. In Western culture, we don't have a preference for which hand to use, but it's considered polite to keep your hands on the table when you're not eating.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I see. In Malaysia, we usually put hands on lap when not eating. It is more polite.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good point. Another thing, in Western countries, it's common to leave a tip for the server. Is tipping a custom in Malaysia?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Not so much. In Malaysia, service charge is usually included in the bill. But sometimes, if service is very good, people may give small tip.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. What about making noise while eating? Is it acceptable?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, it is not polite. We try to eat quietly. But sometimes, when eating certain... um, soup or noodles, slight noise is okay.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. In Western culture, making loud noises while eating is generally considered impolite. It's good to know these differences.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, it is good to learn. Culture is very... um, interesting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Thanks for sharing all this, Farah. It was really enlightening.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You are welcome. I learn also from you. Thank you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We should do this again sometime. Take care, Farah!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, talk to you later. Bye!
