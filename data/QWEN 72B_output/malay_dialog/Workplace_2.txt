**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Farah! Thanks for stopping by. I wanted to go over a few things with you about the new project we're starting this week.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi, Aiman! Yes, sure. Um, what I need to know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. So, the project is about, um, a marketing campaign for our new product. We need to brainstorm some ideas and create a content plan.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, okay. What, um, step we need to do first?

**Speaker A (NS):** First, we'll gather all the relevant information about the product. That includes the features, target audience, and any existing marketing materials. Then, we'll have a brainstorming session to come up with creative ideas.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay. So, we need to, um, find information about the product and then, um, think of ideas?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. After the brainstorming session, we'll create a content plan. This will outline the types of content we want to produce, like blog posts, social media posts, and maybe even a video.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Got it. We create, um, plan for, like, blog and social media?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right. We'll also need to set deadlines for each task and assign roles to team members. You'll be helping with the social media content and working closely with the design team.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Ah, I see. So, I will, um, help with social media and, um, work with design team?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Do you have any questions about your role or the project in general?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I think, um, I understand. But, um, how we start the brainstorming?

**Speaker A (NS):** We'll start by scheduling a meeting. I'll send out an email to the team with the details and some background information. Then, we'll all meet to share our ideas.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, that sounds good. When we, um, have the meeting?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could have it on Thursday afternoon. Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, Thursday, um, works for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'll send out the details soon. Is there anything else you need before we wrap up?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I think that's all. Thank you, Aiman.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome, Farah. Let's keep in touch and make sure everything goes smoothly. See you on Thursday!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, see you on Thursday. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Farah!
