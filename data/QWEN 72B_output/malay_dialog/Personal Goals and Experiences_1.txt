**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking! So, I heard you’re interested in learning a new skill. What is it?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to learn... um, how to say... cooking.

**Speaker A (NS):** Cooking! That’s a great choice. What kind of cooking are you interested in?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I want to learn... um, how to cook, like, local dishes. Malay food, I mean.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds delicious! Why is learning to cook Malay food important to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I think, um... it is important because... it is part of my culture. And, I want to, um... share it with my friends and family.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, sharing your culture through food is a wonderful way to connect with others. Have you started learning any recipes yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I try to make... um, Nasi Lemak. But it is not easy. I need more practice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nasi Lemak is a classic! It does take some practice. What are some of the challenges you’re facing?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** The, um... how to say... coconut milk, it is hard to get it right. And the, um... spices, I sometimes use too much.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Practice really helps with that. Maybe you can try making it a few times and adjust the seasoning each time.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I think so. I also read some... um, recipe books. My mother, she teach me some, too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Having a good teacher can make a big difference. Do you have a favorite dish you want to master first?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I want to make Rendang. It is famous, and I really like it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Rendang is amazing! It’s a bit more complex, but it’s definitely worth the effort. Do you have any tips for making it better?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I try to, um... cook it slowly. And use, um... fresh ingredients, like lemongrass and galangal.

**Speaker A (NS):** Slow cooking and fresh ingredients are key! You’re on the right track. Good luck with your cooking journey!
