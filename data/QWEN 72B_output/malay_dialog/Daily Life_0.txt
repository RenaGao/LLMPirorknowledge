**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah! How's it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Hi Aiman! I am good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, can you tell me about your morning routine?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, yeah... I wake up early, around 6 a.m. Then I pray subuh. After that, I take shower.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good start to the day. What do you do after your shower?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I make breakfast, usually some nasi lemak or toast. Sometimes I have cereal too. Then I go to my room and read some book or check my emails.

**Speaker A (NS):** Reading in the morning is a great habit. How long do you spend on that?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** About 30 minutes. Then I get ready for work. Um, I pack my bag, and I make sure I have everything I need for the day.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very organized. Do you have any morning exercise or a specific routine to keep you active?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, sometimes I do some yoga or stretching. It depends on how I feel that day. If I am tired, I just do a short walk around my house.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good way to stay flexible and energized. What about you, Aiman? What’s your morning routine like?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I am curious too! What do you do?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I usually wake up around 7 a.m. I start with some light stretching, then I drink a glass of water. After that, I have a quick breakfast, usually some fruit and yogurt.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** That sounds healthy! Do you have any other morning activities?

**Speaker A (NS):** I like to read the news and check my emails. Then I get ready for work or any plans for the day. Sometimes I do a bit of meditation to start the day calmly.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Meditation is good. I should try that. It sounds relaxing.

**Speaker A (NS):** It really is! It helps me stay focused and calm. So, what do you usually do after you leave the house?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** I go to my office. I work in marketing. I start my day with a team meeting. Then I handle emails and work on projects.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds busy but productive. It’s good to have a routine to keep you on track.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, it helps a lot. Thanks for sharing your routine too, Aiman!

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! It was great chatting with you, Farah. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Take care, Aiman. Bye!
