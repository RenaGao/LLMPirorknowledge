**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Farah, how are you? I wanted to talk about what happened at the mall last weekend.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, hey Aiman. I am fine, thank you. What about the mall?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I noticed that you seemed a bit upset when we were there. Was everything okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I... I was a bit tired, and maybe I was not very happy with the food court. But it is okay, no big problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. I just wanted to make sure. I thought maybe there was something else bothering you. Did anything specific happen?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, no, nothing big. Just a little thing. You know, the line for the food was very long. I was hungry and a bit frustrated.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, I understand. That can be really annoying. I’m sorry I didn’t realize you were upset. Maybe next time we can go somewhere with shorter lines.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that will be better. Thank you for understanding. I should have told you then, but I did not want to ruin the day.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s totally fine. Communication is important, and I appreciate you telling me now. We can always find a solution together.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Setuju! I really enjoy spending time with you, and I do not want any misunderstanding between us.

**Speaker A (NS):** I feel the same way. Let’s plan something fun for this weekend. How about going to the new coffee shop downtown?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Boleh! That sounds nice. I have not been to that place yet.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We can try their new menu items and maybe catch up on some things.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, that will be good. What time should we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 11 a.m.?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okey, 11 a.m. is fine. I will be there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll see you then. Take care, Farah.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too, Aiman. Jumpa nanti!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you later!
