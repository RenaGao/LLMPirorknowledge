**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I'm lost and trying to find my way to the Grand Hotel. Could you help me?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Sure, I can help you. You from where now? 

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm currently standing near the post office.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, I see. Post office, how to say... it is in the city center, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that's right. It's right in the middle of the city.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, so from there, you go straight until you see the big park.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I'll go straight until I see the big park. What happens next?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** After park, you turn left. There is a street with many shops. You keep walking, about five minutes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. I turn left after the park and walk for about five minutes. What should I look out for?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You will see a tall building on your right side. That is the Grand Hotel. You cannot miss it, very big.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thanks! So, to summarize: I go straight to the big park, turn left, walk for five minutes, and look for the tall building on the right. Is that correct?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, exactly! That is correct. Very easy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you so much! It's really helpful. 

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You are welcome. If you need more help, just ask anyone. Everyone is friendly here.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's good to know. I really appreciate your assistance. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** You too! Good luck, and see you around maybe.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks! Bye for now!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Bye-bye!
