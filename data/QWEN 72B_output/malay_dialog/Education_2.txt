**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Aiman, how’s it going? How’s the homework coming along?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Oh, hi! I’m okay, but the homework a bit... um, difficult. I not sure what to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. What part are you having trouble with?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** The, um, how to say... the math problem. The one about, um, the equations?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, the equations problem. Can you tell me more about what’s confusing you?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Yes, I not understand how to solve it. The teacher say we have to use, um, the formula, but I not sure which one.

**Speaker A (NS):** I get it. Have you asked the teacher for help?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I not want to bother him. But maybe I should, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s always a good idea to ask if you’re unsure. Let’s go over it together first, and then we can decide if you need to talk to him.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, that sound good. Can we look at the problem now?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! Let me see the problem. Can you show me what you have so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Um, I try this, but I not sure if it correct. (Shows work)

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. You’re on the right track, but let’s check the steps. First, you need to isolate the variable.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Isolate the... variable, yes. I see. So, I put the x on one side?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And then you can simplify the equation. Let’s do it step by step.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okay, I try again. (Pauses) Is this right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, that’s better! You got it. If you still have questions, definitely go to the teacher. He’ll be happy to help.

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Thank you! I will. I feel more confident now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’m glad I could help. Do you want to review anything else?

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** No, I think I understand. Thank you so much!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Aiman. Good luck with the homework. I’ll see you later!

**Speaker B (L2, Malay):** Okey, see you later! Thank you again!
