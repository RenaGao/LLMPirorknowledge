**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi! I am fine, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking! So, we were thinking about planning a birthday surprise for Bilal. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, we can... how to say... we can make party at my house. I have big room, and it is very nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! What about decorations and food?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, um, we can make colorful balloons and streamers. And for food, I can cook some traditional Pakistani dishes. Um, like biryani and samosas.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a wonderful idea! Do you need any help with the cooking?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, please! It will be good if you help me. We can also ask others to bring some snacks and drinks.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can bring some snacks and drinks. What about a cake?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I can buy cake, yes. Maybe chocolate cake, because Bilal loves chocolate.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! What about the invitations? How should we let everyone know?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We can send messages on WhatsApp. It is easy, and everyone will get it quickly.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea! And what about a theme? Any thoughts on that?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, we can make it a movie night. Everyone can come dressed as their favorite movie character.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fun! We can even watch a movie together. Which one do you think Bilal would like?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** He likes action movies, so maybe we can watch something like ‘The Avengers’ or ‘Mission: Impossible.’

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! And we can make it a surprise by not telling him anything until the party starts. 

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that will be very fun! Um, I think we should also make a playlist with his favorite songs.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a fantastic idea! I’ll start working on that right away. Do you have any specific songs in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, he likes old Bollywood songs and some English songs by Ed Sheeran.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll add those to the playlist. It’s all coming together nicely! Thanks, Ayesha, for all your help.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome! I am excited. It will be a great surprise for Bilal.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! We’ll make sure it’s a memorable birthday. Thanks again, and let’s keep in touch to plan the details.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, talk to you soon. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! See you soon!
