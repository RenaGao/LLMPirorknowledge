**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Bilal, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi Ayesha. Um, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. So, we need to talk about the upcoming group project. Do you have any ideas on how we should approach it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I have some thought. But, um, it is little hard to explain. We have to do presentation on, how to say... climate change?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right. It can be a tricky topic. What specific aspects of climate change do you think we should focus on?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I think we should talk about, how climate change affect... how to say... agriculture and, um, water supply. It is very important.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great point. Those are definitely crucial areas. Do you have any ideas on how we can structure our presentation?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we can, um, start with, how to say... introduction to climate change. And then, we can talk about, how it affect agriculture and water supply. And at end, we can give, how to say... solution?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. We can also include some graphs and statistics to make our points clear. Have you found any good resources for that?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I find some good article and, um, report from, how to say... United Nations?

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. The UN reports are very reliable. How about we divide the work? You can handle the agriculture part, and I'll take water supply.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is good plan. I will start work on agriculture. And, um, you can help me if I have any problem?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! We're a team. We can also meet and discuss our progress regularly. How about we meet every week?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is good. We can meet, um, every Wednesday?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good to me. Let's plan to meet at the library on Wednesdays. Any other concerns or ideas you have?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think we cover everything. Thank you for help, Ayesha.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all, Bilal. I'm here to support you. Let's do a great job on this project. See you on Wednesday!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, see you on Wednesday. Bye, Ayesha.
