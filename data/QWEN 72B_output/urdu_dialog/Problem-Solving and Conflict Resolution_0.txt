**Scene: Ayesha and Bilal are discussing a misunderstanding about a missed meeting.**

**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Bilal, how are you? I was a bit surprised when I didn’t see you at the study group yesterday. Everything okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes, I am good, thank you. Um, actually, I forget about meeting. I am sorry.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, but I was a bit worried. Did something come up?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I have... um, family thing. My uncle come for visit. I not check my phone.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. That makes sense. I should have texted you again to remind you. I’m glad it was nothing serious.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, and I should tell you early. I not want to miss, but I forget.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s okay, Bilal. These things happen. We can catch up today if you have time.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I can come library. How to say... good place for study.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. The environment there is really nice. What time works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I free after lunch. Maybe... one o’clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** One o’clock works for me. I’ll be there. We can go over the notes and plan for the next week.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that sound good. I bring my books. We can make good plan.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll see you then. Thanks for being so understanding, Bilal.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Of course, no problem. I see you at one o’clock.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too. Bye!
