**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Welcome to our store. How can I assist you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, good afternoon. I am looking for... um, new... new laptop. My old one, it is... it is not working properly.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. What do you primarily use your laptop for? Work, school, or entertainment?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Mostly for work. I do some... coding and design. And sometimes, I watch movies.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! For coding and design, you’ll need a laptop with a good processor and a decent graphics card. We have a few models that are perfect for that. Have you considered any specific brands?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I heard about... how to say... Apple and HP. But I am not sure which one to choose.

**Speaker A (NS):** Both are excellent choices. Apple laptops are known for their design and performance, but they can be a bit more expensive. HP offers great value for money with good performance. What’s your budget like?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** My budget is... um, around... 1000 dollars.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. In that range, I would recommend the HP Pavilion. It has a strong processor, good RAM, and a nice screen for your needs. Would you like to take a look at it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I would like to see it. Can you... show me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Follow me, I’ll show you the model. ( walks to the laptop section )

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** ( following ) Thank you. This one looks good. What is the... um, warranty?

**Speaker A (NS):** This model comes with a one-year warranty, and you can extend it for additional coverage if you need. It also has excellent customer support.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That sounds good. I think I will take it. ( pauses ) One more thing, how long does it take to... deliver?

**Speaker A (NS):** If you place your order today, it should be delivered within three to five business days. We also offer in-store pickup if you prefer.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** In-store pickup sounds good. I will come to pick it up tomorrow. ( smiles )

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I’ll set it up for you. Is there anything else you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think that’s all. Thank you so much for your help. You are very kind.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s my pleasure! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Safe travels!
