**Scene: Ayesha and Bilal are discussing a mistake Ayesha made at work. Ayesha is the native English speaker, and Bilal is the Urdu-speaking second-language learner.**

**Ayesha (NS):** Hey Bilal, thanks for meeting me today. I need to talk to you about something important.

**Bilal (L2, Urdu):** Yes, Ayesha. Of course, what is it?

**Ayesha (NS):** I made a mistake at work yesterday. I sent an email to the wrong client, and it contained some sensitive information.

**Bilal (L2, Urdu):** Oh no, that sound very bad. What happen next?

**Ayesha (NS):** I realized the mistake right after I hit send. I immediately called the client to explain and apologize.

**Bilal (L2, Urdu):** That good, to act quick. But the client, they understand?

**Ayesha (NS):** They were upset initially, but they appreciated my honesty and quick action. I promised to take steps to prevent this from happening again.

**Bilal (L2, Urdu):** What kind of steps, you mean?

**Ayesha (NS):** I’m going to set up better filters in my email system and double-check all sensitive emails before sending them. I also plan to have a colleague review important emails.

**Bilal (L2, Urdu):** That very smart solution. I think, if you do this, the problem not happen again.

**Ayesha (NS):** I hope so. I also want to offer our client some additional services to make up for the inconvenience.

**Bilal (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that good idea. Offer something they value, like free consultation or discount.

**Ayesha (NS):** Exactly! I’m thinking of giving them a free consultation and a 10% discount on their next project.

**Bilal (L2, Urdu):** That show you really sorry and want to fix the mistake. I think client will appreciate.

**Ayesha (NS):** Thanks, Bilal. Your suggestions are really helpful. I feel more confident now.

**Bilal (L2, Urdu):** You welcome. Mistake happen, but how you handle, that important.

**Ayesha (NS):** That’s true. I appreciate your support. Let’s keep in touch and catch up again soon.

**Bilal (L2, Urdu):** Sure, Ayesha. Take care.

**Ayesha (NS):** You too, Bilal. Goodbye!

**Bilal (L2, Urdu):** Bye!
