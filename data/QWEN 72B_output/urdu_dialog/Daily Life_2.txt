**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! Welcome to the apartment. I hope you’re settling in well. What do you think of the place so far?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, thanks! Yes, it’s very nice. I like it a lot. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing great, thanks. So, I was thinking, it would be nice to cook a meal together this weekend. Do you have a favorite dish you’d like to prepare?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, that sounds good. Um, my favorite dish is... how to say... karahi gosht. It’s a Pakistani dish with meat and tomatoes and spices. You’ll like it, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Karahi gosht sounds delicious! How do you prepare it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, so first, you need to cut the meat into small pieces. You can use chicken or mutton. Then, you put oil in a pan and fry onions and ginger and garlic. You have to stir it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. So, you sauté the onions, ginger, and garlic first. What’s next?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** After that, you add tomatoes. They should be chopped. And then you put in the meat and mix it all together. You have to cook it for a while.

**Speaker A (NS):** And do you add any spices?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, you add garam masala, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. And a little bit of salt. You have to mix it well and let it cook for about half an hour.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really flavorful. Do you usually serve it with anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we usually serve it with naan bread or rice. It goes very well with that.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect. I love naan bread. So, we’ll need to buy some ingredients. When do you think we can go shopping?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We can go tomorrow if you want. It’s not a problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good to me. We can go to the market tomorrow afternoon. How about 3 PM?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, 3 PM is fine. I will be ready.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’m looking forward to it. Thanks for sharing your favorite dish with me, Ayesha. It’s going to be a lot of fun.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Me too. Thanks for inviting me. I’m excited to cook with you.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow, then. Have a good evening!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too, have a good evening! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Ayesha!
