**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi! I am good, thank you. You?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. So, I heard we have an upcoming exam. Have you started preparing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I start preparing last week. Um, how to say... I read some chapters and make notes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Which chapters have you covered?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I finish chapter one and two. They are about... um, the history of the topic and basic concepts.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a good start. Have you found anything particularly challenging?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, some of the theories in chapter two are... um, difficult. I not understand them fully.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Maybe we can go over those theories together. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that would be very helpful. When you are free?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m free tomorrow afternoon. How about we meet at the library?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, library is good. What time?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about 2 PM?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** 2 PM is fine. Is it okay if I bring my notes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! That would be great. We can go over your notes and any questions you have.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I really appreciate your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I’m looking forward to it. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, see you tomorrow. Thank you again. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Ayesha! Take care.
