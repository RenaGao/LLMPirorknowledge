**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I heard you’ve been watching some new movies and TV shows. What have you enjoyed lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I have. Um, I watched this movie... how to say... "The Shawshank Redemption." It is very good movie, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I love that movie! What did you like about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like, um, the story. It is... how to say... very inspiring. And the acting is also very good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! The acting is fantastic. Have you seen any good TV shows recently?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I watched "Stranger Things." It is, um, very interesting. It is about, uh, some kids and, um, mystery things.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great show! It’s really suspenseful and has a lot of heart. What other shows do you like?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like, um, "Friends." It is very funny, and the characters are, um, very nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** "Friends" is a classic! It’s always a good choice for a laugh. What do you think about "Game of Thrones"?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** "Game of Thrones"? I watched a few episodes, but it is, um, very... how to say... complicated. I did not finish it.

**Speaker A (NS):** It can be a bit overwhelming with all the characters and plot twists. Do you have any recommendations for me?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I recommend "The Crown." It is, um, about the British royal family. It is very, um, beautiful and, um, interesting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, Ayesha! I’ve heard good things about "The Crown." I’ll definitely check it out. What’s your next movie or show on your list?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think I will watch, um, "Breaking Bad." My friend told me it is very good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! "Breaking Bad" is an incredible series. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it. Well, it was great catching up with you. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it was nice talking to you too. Take care, Bilal! Bye!
