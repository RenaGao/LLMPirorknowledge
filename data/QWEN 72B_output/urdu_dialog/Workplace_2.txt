**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I wanted to explain a new task to you. We’re organizing a book donation drive for the community library. I thought you might be interested in helping out.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, of course. I am happy to help. Um, what exactly is... how to say... this task about?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure thing! We’re collecting books to donate to the new community library. We need to sort them into categories and then pack them up for delivery. Do you think you can help with that?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I can help. Can you tell me more about the categories we need to sort the books into?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. We’re sorting them into fiction, non-fiction, children’s books, and reference materials. We also have a special section for books in Urdu and other languages.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That sounds good. I can take care of the Urdu books. And, um, how to say... the children’s books too, if you want.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfect! Do you need any help identifying the categories, or do you feel comfortable with that?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think I can manage. But if I have any question, can I ask you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! Feel free to ask me anything. We want to make sure everything is sorted correctly. When and where should we start?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, maybe tomorrow in the afternoon? We can meet at the office and then go to the library together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds great! What time works for you in the afternoon?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Two o’clock is good for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll see you at 2:00 PM tomorrow. We can grab the books and head to the library together.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is fine. I will be there. Thank you for asking me to help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I’m looking forward to working with you. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, see you tomorrow. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Ayesha! Take care!
