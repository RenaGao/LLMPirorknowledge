**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal, how are you? I wanted to talk to you about something.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, hello Ayesha! I am fine, how about you? What you want to talk about?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good, thanks. I was a bit upset yesterday because it seemed like you were avoiding me.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I see. I did not mean to give that impression. Um, I was just busy with my studies, you know.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand you’re busy, but I felt a bit left out. We haven’t hung out in a while.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I know. I feel bad about that. I have been working on my project and had a lot of reading to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s totally fine, but maybe we could find a way to stay in touch more. Even just a quick chat or a text?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I can do that. I will try to find more time. I miss our talks too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great. I was thinking, maybe we could meet up this weekend and go to the library together?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Library? Yes, that’s a good idea. I need to get some books on history, and you can read what you like.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! What time works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, let’s say afternoon? One o’clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** One o’clock sounds good. I’ll meet you there.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ok, I will be there. Thank you for understanding, Ayesha.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, Bilal. I’m glad we talked this out. See you on Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, see you on Saturday. Take care!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Bye, Bilal.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Bye, Ayesha.
