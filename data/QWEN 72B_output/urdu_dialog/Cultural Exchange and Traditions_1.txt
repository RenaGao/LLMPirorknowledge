**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Ayesha! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good. Thank you for asking. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I was wondering if we could chat about dining etiquette. I find it really interesting to compare how different cultures approach it.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, very interesting. In Pakistan, um, we have some different... how to say... rules and customs.

**Speaker A (NS):** Can you tell me more about that? For example, what’s a typical dining setup in your home?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, in many homes, we eat on the floor. We spread a cloth, it is called a... dastarkhwan. And we sit on cushions.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really cozy. Do you use utensils, or do you eat with your hands?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We mostly eat with our hands, especially for... um, biryani and curries. But we do use spoons for soup and sometimes forks.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really different from what we usually do here. We always use utensils. Forks, knives, and spoons are standard. What about the seating arrangement?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, we sit in a circle, how to say... everyone faces each other. It is very, um, social.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like a great way to foster conversation and community. Do you have any specific rules about who sits where?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, the eldest person usually sits at the head of the circle. And the youngest, they sit closer to the door.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a respectful way to arrange things. In American culture, the seating is more flexible, but we often have the head of the household at the end of the table. What about using your left hand?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes, very important. We only use our right hand for eating. The left hand is considered... um, unclean.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. That’s a significant difference. Here, people use both hands, but we do try to keep our table manners polite.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, in Pakistan, it is, um, a bit more relaxed, but still, we try to be clean and, um, respectful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Are there any specific gestures or phrases used during meals, like saying grace or toasting?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we say, um, "Bismillah" before eating. And after the meal, we say... um, "Alhamdulillah." It is, um, a way to show gratitude.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s beautiful. In the U.S., some people say grace, but it’s not as common. We do often toast on special occasions, saying "Cheers" or "To good health."

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I understand. It is, um, similar in, um, showing good wishes.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you have any specific table manners that you find unique to your culture?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, we try to, um, finish all the food on our plate. It is, um, disrespectful to waste food. And, um, we always, um, say thank you to the person who cooked the meal.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a wonderful tradition. In the U.S., we also appreciate a clean plate, but it’s not as strictly followed. And saying thank you to the cook is definitely important.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think, um, both cultures value, um, gratitude and, um, respect.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. It’s fascinating to see the similarities and differences. Thanks for sharing all this with me, Ayesha.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome. It was, um, a pleasure to talk to you. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Ayesha! Take care.
