**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking. So, I heard you’re planning a weekend picnic with your family. That sounds fun!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it will be nice. We have not done this in a long time. Um... how to say... it is a tradition in our family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Where are you planning to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We will go to the park near our house. It is very beautiful. There are many trees and a small lake.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds lovely! What kind of food are you thinking of bringing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We will bring some... um... parathas and samosas. And also, some fruits and juice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those sound delicious! Are you planning any games or activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we will play cricket. My brother and I love playing cricket. And maybe, um... some card games for the kids.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great plan! What time are you planning to leave?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We will leave around... um... 9 o'clock in the morning. It will be cool, and we can enjoy the day.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Have you checked the weather forecast?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it looks like it will be sunny and not too hot. Perfect for a picnic.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear! Do you need any help with anything, like setting up or bringing something extra?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think we have everything covered. But thank you for offering. It is very kind of you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I hope you all have a wonderful time. It sounds like it will be a memorable day.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! We are all very excited. I will tell you how it goes.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’d love to hear about it! Enjoy your picnic, Bilal.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thanks a lot! Take care.

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Bye for now.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Bye.
