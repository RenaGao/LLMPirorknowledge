**Speaker A (NS):** Thank you for that. Have you tried restarting your router?

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay. Let’s try a few more steps. Can you confirm if the power light on the router is on and steady?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes, power light is on. It is steady.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. What about the other lights, like the Ethernet or Wi-Fi lights?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Wi-Fi light is blinking. Ethernet light is on, but not blinking.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good observation. Let’s check the connections. Can you make sure all the cables are securely plugged in?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I check. All cable are in place.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s try a factory reset. You’ll need to press and hold the reset button for about 10 seconds. Do you see the reset button on your router?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I see it. I hold for ten second. What next?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good. After the reset, wait a few minutes for the router to reboot. Then, try connecting to the internet again.
