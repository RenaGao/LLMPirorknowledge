**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Ayesha! Thanks for coming. I wanted to go over the process for organizing the new book donations we receive. Can you follow along with me?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi! Yes, of course. I am here to learn. How we start?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! First, we need to sort the books by category. We have sections like fiction, non-fiction, children's books, and reference materials.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, yes. We put fiction here, and non-fiction... um, here. Children's books, they go... here. Right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Once they’re sorted, we check each book for damage or any issues. If a book is in poor condition, we set it aside and note it down.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we check for... um, torn pages, missing covers... things like that. If problem, we put aside?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's right. After that, we need to log each book in our system. We use the barcode scanner to do this quickly.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, the barcode scanner. I remember. We scan, and it goes in... um, the computer?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, it goes into our database. Then, we need to label each book with its location in the library. This helps patrons find the books easily.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we put sticker... um, label on the book. With number or... um, section name?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly, the section name and the shelf number. Once all the books are labeled, we can place them on the appropriate shelves.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we put them in right place. Then, they ready for people to borrow.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Do you have any questions about the process?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, just one. How we know if book already in the library?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. We can check the database to see if the book is already in our collection. If it is, we can either add it to the inventory or thank the donor and explain that we already have it.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, I see. We check database, and if have, we thank donor. Got it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Is there anything else you’d like to ask or practice?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think I understand. Thank you for explaining everything clearly.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Ayesha! I’m sure you’ll do a great job. Let’s meet tomorrow to start organizing the new donations.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, tomorrow. I will be ready. Thank you!

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Have a good day, Ayesha.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too! Bye!
