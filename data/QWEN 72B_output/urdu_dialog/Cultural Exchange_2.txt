**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I was wondering, what's your favorite holiday in Pakistan?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, favorite holiday? I think it is Eid-ul-Fitr. Yes, Eid-ul-Fitr.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s a great choice! What do you like about Eid-ul-Fitr?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, it is special because it marks the end of Ramadan. We do... um... fasting for one month, and then we celebrate with family and friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really meaningful. What kind of traditions do you have during Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We wear new clothes, and we go to mosque for prayers. Then, we visit relatives and exchange gifts. We also... um... how to say... we give money to children, called Eidi.

**Speaker A (NS):** Eidi, that’s right! That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of food do you usually eat?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We eat many special dishes. Um, biryani, which is rice and meat. And also, we eat sweets like sheer khurma. It is very delicious.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sheer khurma sounds amazing! Is there a particular part of the day that you enjoy the most during Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like the morning, when we go to mosque and pray together. It is very peaceful, and I feel very close to my community.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s beautiful. How do people prepare for Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We clean our houses, and we decorate them. We also, um, how to say... we buy new clothes and gifts. And we cook a lot of food to share with family and friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a wonderful celebration. Do you have any special memories from past Eids?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I remember one year when I was a child. My whole family gathered, and we played traditional games. We also, um, how to say... we sang songs and danced. It was very joyful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a beautiful memory. I hope you have a wonderful Eid this year!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! I hope so too. And thank you for asking about my favorite holiday.

**Speaker A (NS):** It was a pleasure to learn more about Eid-ul-Fitr. Talk to you later, Bilal!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, talk to you later. Goodbye!
