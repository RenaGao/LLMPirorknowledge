**Scene: Two friends, Ayesha and Bilal, are discussing their morning routines.**

**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Bilal, how’s it going? I heard you have a pretty interesting morning routine. Can you tell me about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi Ayesha! Yes, okay, my morning routine... um, I wake up early, around six o'clock. Then I, um... how to say... fresh up.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, you freshen up. That’s a good start!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, then I, um... drink water and do... some exercise. Like, um, stretching and... some, how to say... push-ups.

**Speaker A (NS):** Push-ups, got it! That’s great for staying active. What do you do after that?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** After that, I make breakfast. I usually eat... eggs and toast. Sometimes, um, paratha.

**Speaker A (NS):** Paratha sounds delicious! Do you have a specific reason for starting your day with a good breakfast?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think breakfast is important. It give me energy for whole day. And, um, I read newspaper while eating.

**Speaker A (NS):** Reading the newspaper is a great way to stay informed. What about you, Ayesha? What does your morning routine look like?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Your turn.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! I usually wake up around seven, and I start with a quick shower. Then I make coffee and have a light breakfast, like cereal or a yogurt.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, coffee, that must be nice. And what do you do after breakfast?

**Speaker A (NS):** After breakfast, I check my emails and do a bit of planning for the day. Sometimes I also do a short meditation to clear my mind.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Meditation, that sounds good. I should try that sometime. Um, you do meditation every day?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not every day, but I try to do it a few times a week. It really helps me stay focused and calm.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe I start with one day a week. It can’t hurt, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, give it a try! So, what’s your favorite part of your morning routine, Bilal?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** My favorite part is... um, the quiet time in the morning. It is, um... peaceful. I like that.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can totally understand that. The morning can be a great time for reflection and setting intentions for the day. Thanks for sharing your routine, Bilal!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome. Thank you for sharing yours, Ayesha. We should do this again sometime.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! Have a good day, Bilal!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too, Ayesha. Bye!
