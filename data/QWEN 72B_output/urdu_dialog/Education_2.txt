**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, Ayesha. I am good, how are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! Did you get a chance to look at the homework assignment?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I look at it. But, um, I have some questions. It is not very clear to me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. What part is confusing you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Well, the, um, how to say... the part about the essay. I do not understand what teacher want us to write.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's break it down. The assignment says you need to write an essay on the impact of social media on communication. Do you know what that means?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I know what is social media, but I am not sure what teacher mean by "impact." It is good or bad?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good question. The teacher wants you to discuss both the positive and negative effects. For example, how social media can help people connect, but also how it can lead to misinformation.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, I see. So, I need to write about good things and bad things about social media.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And you should use examples to support your points. Do you have any ideas for examples?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think I can use, um, how social media help people in disaster time. And also, how it spread fake news.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those are great examples! You're on the right track. How long does the essay need to be?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** The assignment say it should be about three to four pages.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. You have enough space to go into detail with your examples. Do you feel more confident now?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I feel better. But I think I still need to ask teacher some more questions to be sure.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a good idea. When is the assignment due?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It is due next Friday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Plenty of time. Maybe you can go to office hours and talk to the teacher. Theyâ€™re usually very helpful.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will do that. Thank you for helping me, Ayesha.

**Speaker A (NS):** You're welcome! If you have more questions, just let me know. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! You too. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Bilal! Take care!
