**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Bilal! How’s it going? What are your plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. Weekend... um, I think I go to the library. Yes, the new library. I hear it is very nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! Have you been there before?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I went yesterday. Environment is very good, you know, quiet and clean.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect for studying. What books are you planning to take?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I take some history books and one new storybook. And you? What do you want to read?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m thinking of reading some poetry. Maybe some classic English poets.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, I like poetry too. In Urdu, we have many good poets. But, um, how to say... time is a problem sometimes.

**Speaker A (NS):** I know what you mean. But if we manage our time better, we can do a lot. Want to come to the library with me tomorrow?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is a good idea. I will come. We can meet in the afternoon, maybe around two?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect. I’ll see you there. It will be fun to study together.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Definitely! I will bring my books. See you tomorrow, insha'Allah.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Take care, and I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Bye-bye!
