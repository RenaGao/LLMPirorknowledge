**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks! We’re planning a trip to a new city with our friends. Have you thought about where you’d like to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I was thinking... um, how to say... a city with good history and beautiful places. Maybe, um, Lahore?

**Speaker A (NS):** Lahore sounds like a fantastic choice! It’s got a rich history and some amazing architecture. What kind of places do you want to visit there?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I want to see the Badshahi Mosque and the Lahore Fort. And also, um, the Wazir Khan Mosque. They are very famous.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, those are must-visit places! Do you have any favorite local foods you’d like to try?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I want to try... um, how to say... biryani and samosas. They are very tasty.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choices! Biryani and samosas are delicious. How about the trip logistics? When are you free to go?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I am free next week. Um, how about... Monday?

**Speaker A (NS):** Monday works for me too. Let’s check with the others and confirm. How long do you want to stay in Lahore?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think three days should be good. We can see many things in three days.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect! We can plan our itinerary and book accommodations. Do you have any specific hotels in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Not yet. Maybe we can look at some reviews and decide together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. We can share some options and pick the best one. Are there any activities you’d like to do besides sightseeing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I want to go to the markets and buy some souvenirs. And maybe, um, how to say... a boat ride in the park?

**Speaker A (NS):** A boat ride in the park sounds fun! We can definitely include that. It all sounds like it’s coming together nicely.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I am excited! Thank you for planning this trip with me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I’m excited too! Let’s catch up soon to finalize everything. Have a great day, Ayesha!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too! See you later. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Ayesha! Take care!
