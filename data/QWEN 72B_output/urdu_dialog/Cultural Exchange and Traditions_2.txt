**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! How are you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I heard you were thinking about organizing a cultural event to share your traditions with others. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, I want to have event where people can come and learn about Pakistani culture. Maybe have some music, food, and dances.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds fantastic! What kind of food are you thinking of serving?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I want to make biryani, and samosas, and maybe some sweet dishes like kulfi. And we can have tea with cardamom.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yum, all that sounds delicious! What about the music and dances?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** For music, we can have qawwali and some classical Pakistani songs. And for dances, maybe we can have some folk dances like Bhangra and Luddi.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great mix! Have you thought about where you might hold this event?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I was thinking maybe a community center or a park. Somewhere where people can gather and enjoy the atmosphere.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those are both good options. What about the date and time?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, I think weekend would be good. Saturday or Sunday, in the evening, around six or seven.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds perfect. How can people get involved or help out with the event?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** People can help by bringing dishes, or volunteering to set up or clean up. And also, they can bring their family and friends to enjoy.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great way to build community. Do you need any specific help from me?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it would be nice if you can help with promotion, maybe share on social media and help with decorations.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I'd be happy to help with that. It sounds like it's going to be a wonderful event!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you so much. I am excited to see it all come together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Let's keep in touch and plan the details. Have a great day, Ayesha!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, you too. Talk to you soon!
