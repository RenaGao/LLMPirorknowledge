**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! How are you? I was thinking we could plan a group vacation. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. Yes, I think vacation is good idea. Where we want to go?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I was thinking maybe we could go to the mountains. There are some beautiful spots near here, and the weather is perfect this time of year.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, mountains sound nice. But how about beach? Beach also good for relax and sun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Beach is a great option too! What about going to the beach for a few days and then maybe visiting a nearby town for some sightseeing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, this sound good. We can do both. Beach for fun, and town for... um, how to say... explore.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! We can explore the town, maybe visit some historical sites, and try the local food. What kind of activities do you like to do on vacation?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like swimming and walking on beach. Also, I want to read book, maybe take some photos.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect! We can also do some hiking in the town if you’re up for it. How about the others? Have you talked to them?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, not yet. But I will call them today. I think they also like idea of vacation.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let me know what they say. We can finalize the dates and start planning the details.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will do that. And, um, you can also help choose hotel and restaurant?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I’d be happy to help. Let’s aim for the first week of next month. Does that work for you?
