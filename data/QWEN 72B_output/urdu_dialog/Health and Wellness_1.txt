**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Ayesha, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks! I heard you’ve been a bit busy lately. How are you managing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I have a lot of work, but I trying to manage. Um, how to say... I feeling a little tired.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. It’s important to take care of yourself, especially when you’re busy. Do you have any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Not really. I think I will just stay at home and rest. Maybe read some book.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good plan. Reading can be a great way to relax. Have you been getting enough sleep?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, not really. I sleep maybe five or six hour a night. It is not enough, I know.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s right. Try to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep. It can make a big difference in how you feel. How about your diet? Are you eating well?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I try to eat healthy, but sometimes I just eat fast food because I am busy. It is not good, I know.

**Speaker A (NS):** I get it. Fast food can be convenient, but it’s not the best for your health. Maybe you can plan some meals in advance. It can save time and be healthier.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is a good idea. How to say... meal prep?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Meal prep can be really helpful. And don’t forget to stay hydrated. Drinking water is super important.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will try to drink more water. And also, I think I will go for a walk. It is good for health, no?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Walking is a great way to stay active and clear your mind. How about setting aside some time each day for a short walk?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will do that. I think it will help me feel better. Thank you for your advice, it is very helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Ayesha! I’m glad I could help. Let’s catch up again soon to see how you’re doing.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that would be nice. Take care, and I hope you have a good day.

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Ayesha. Stay healthy! Goodbye!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Goodbye! Take care.
