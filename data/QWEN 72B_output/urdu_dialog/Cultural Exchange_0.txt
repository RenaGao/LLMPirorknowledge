**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! It's great to see you again. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I heard you were telling me about a tradition or festival from your country. Could you share more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, sure! I want to tell you about Eid-ul-Fitr. It is very, um, important festival for Muslims in Pakistan.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! Could you explain what Eid-ul-Fitr is all about?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Eid-ul-Fitr is at the end of Ramadan. Ramadan is... um, month of fasting. We, we don’t eat or drink from sunrise to sunset.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. So, it’s a time of reflection and discipline?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, exactly. And when Eid comes, it is like, big celebration. People, um, they wear new clothes, go to mosque for prayer...

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds beautiful. What else do people do during Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We, um, visit family and friends. Children get, um, gifts and money from elders. And, we prepare special food, like, um, how to say... sweets and desserts.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s wonderful! What are some of the special sweets and desserts?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We make sevaiyan, it is a sweet vermicelli pudding. And, um, barfi, it is a milk-based sweet.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sevaiyan and barfi sound delicious! How do people usually celebrate with their community?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We, um, have big, um, gatherings. People exchange, um, greetings and, um, they, they often cook together. It is, um, very, very joyful time.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds like a wonderful celebration. Is there anything specific you do to prepare for Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we, um, clean our houses and, um, make, um, special decorations. And, we, um, buy new clothes for family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really thoughtful. It must be a very special time for everyone.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is. It brings, um, people together and, um, spreads, um, happiness.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can definitely see that. Thank you so much for sharing this with me, Ayesha. It’s been really enlightening.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome! I am happy to share. Maybe, um, you can visit Pakistan one day and, um, experience it yourself.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be amazing! I hope I get the chance. Thanks again, Ayesha. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! You too, take care!
