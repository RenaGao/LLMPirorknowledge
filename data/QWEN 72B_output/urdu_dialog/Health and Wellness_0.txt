**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! How are you feeling today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, Doctor. Um, I not feeling very well. I have... how to say... head pain and fever.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Can you tell me more about your headache? When did it start?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It start yesterday. And the pain is... um, in my head, here. (points to forehead) It is throbbing.

**Speaker A (NS):** Throbbing, okay. Do you have any other symptoms? Like nausea or dizziness?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I have little nausea. And, um, I feel very tired.

**Speaker A (NS):** How long have you had the fever?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It start yesterday, same time as headache. I take medicine, but not working well.

**Speaker A (NS):** Have you taken any specific medication?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I take paracetamol. But still have fever.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or any other symptoms?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I eat normal. But I have some, um, cough.

**Speaker A (NS):** Do you have a dry cough or is it producing phlegm?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It is dry. No phlegm.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, let's do a quick physical examination. (pauses) Your temperature is a bit high, and your throat looks a little red. Have you been in contact with anyone who has been sick recently?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I not. But my coworker was sick last week.

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s possible you might have a viral infection. I’ll prescribe some medication to help with the symptoms. You should also get plenty of rest and stay hydrated.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, Doctor. How long I need to take medicine?

**Speaker A (NS):** Take the medication for the next 5 to 7 days, and if you don’t see any improvement, come back for a follow-up.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will do that. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Ayesha. Take care and feel better soon. Goodbye!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Goodbye, Doctor. Thank you.
