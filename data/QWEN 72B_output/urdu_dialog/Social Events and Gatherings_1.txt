**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, do you have any fun plans for this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, not really. Just some reading, maybe. Why, do you have idea?

**Speaker A (NS):** Actually, I was thinking we could plan a surprise party for Bilal. He has been so busy lately, and it would be nice to celebrate his recent promotion.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, that is good idea! I think he will like that. When we do this?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this Saturday? It’s a bit of a surprise, so we’ll need to keep it low-key.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Saturday sound good. Where we have party?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking about having it at my place. It’s more private and we can set everything up easily.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, your place is nice. We need to invite people. Who we tell?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s invite our close friends and maybe a few colleagues from his work. We can send out messages later today.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will help with messages. What about food and drinks?

**Speaker A (NS):** We can order some pizza and maybe some snacks. And we should get some soft drinks and maybe a cake.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, cake is good. And we can also make some homemade things, like pakoras or samosas.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! It will add a personal touch. Do you want to handle that part?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Sure, I can do that. And we need decorations?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we should get some balloons and maybe a banner. We can find some online or at a party store.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will check online. And we need to be very careful so Bilal does not find out.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! We’ll need to be secretive. Maybe we can distract him with something on the day of the party.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, good plan. We can invite him to dinner somewhere and then bring him back to your place.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! That sounds like it will work. Thanks, Ayesha, for helping out.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome. I am excited! See you this weekend.

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Let’s make it a great surprise for Bilal. Take care, Ayesha!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Take care! Bye!
