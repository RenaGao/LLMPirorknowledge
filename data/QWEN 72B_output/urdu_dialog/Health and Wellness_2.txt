**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Ayesha! Thanks for coming to our fitness center today. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! I am good, thank you. How to say... very excited to start my fitness journey.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear! So, what are your fitness goals? Are you looking to lose weight, gain muscle, or maybe improve your overall health?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I want to lose some weight and also become more... more fit. How to say... strong.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Losing weight and building strength are excellent goals. Do you have a specific timeline in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I want to see good results in, um, three month. Maybe four?

**Speaker A (NS):** Three to four months is a perfect timeframe. What kind of exercise do you enjoy doing? Like, do you like running, cycling, or maybe yoga?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like walking and... um, yoga. But I also want to try new things, like, how to say... strength training?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! We can definitely include strength training in your routine. How often can you commit to coming to the gym each week?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think I can come um, three times, maybe four times a week.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! So, we’ll start with three times a week and see how it goes. We can always adjust if needed. What about your diet? Have you thought about making any changes there?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I want to eat more, um, healthy food. Like vegetables and fruits. And less... less junk food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a fantastic plan! Eating more vegetables and fruits and cutting down on junk food will definitely support your fitness goals. We can also provide some nutritional tips if you like.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, please! I would like that very much.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, let’s summarize. We’ll meet three times a week, focus on a mix of cardio and strength training, and you’ll also be making some dietary changes. Does that sound good to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it sounds very good! I am very excited to start.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m excited too! We’ll get started right away. See you tomorrow at 10 AM for our first session, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, see you then. Thank you so much for your help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Ayesha! Have a great day, and I’ll see you tomorrow!
