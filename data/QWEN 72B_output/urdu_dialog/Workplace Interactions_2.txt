**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. So, we need to plan a team meeting. When would be a good time for you to meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, how to say... I think tomorrow afternoon is good. But, if team is busy, maybe we can meet in the evening.

**Speaker A (NS):** That works. Let’s aim for tomorrow afternoon. What time specifically?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** How about three o’clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** Three o’clock sounds perfect. Where do you suggest we have the meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We can meet in the conference room, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the conference room is a good choice. What should we cover in the meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** We should talk about the new project, and also, um, how to say... the progress of current tasks.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great points. Should we also discuss any challenges the team is facing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, definitely. And, how to say... any support we need from management.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. Is there anything else you think we should add to the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Maybe, um, how to say... some team building activities. It is good for morale.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Team building is important. I’ll include that in the agenda.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I think this is good plan.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll send out a meeting invite with all the details. See you tomorrow at three?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will be there. Thanks a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Have a great day, Bilal!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too. Goodbye!
