**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Ayesha! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. So, I heard you were telling Bilal about a tradition from your culture. Can you tell me about it too?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, yes! Um, how to say... it is called Eid-ul-Fitr. It is a big festival in Islam.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! What does Eid-ul-Fitr celebrate?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** It celebrates the end of Ramadan, which is a month of fasting. During Ramadan, we do not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset.

**Speaker A (NS):** That must be quite challenging. How do you celebrate when Eid comes?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is challenging, but also very rewarding. Um, on Eid, we wake up early and go to mosque for special prayer. Then we wear new clothes and meet family and friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a beautiful way to come together. Do you have any special foods or traditions?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we have... um, special foods. We eat sweet things like sheer khurma, which is a dessert made with vermicelli and milk. And we also distribute sweets to neighbors and relatives.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sheer khurma sounds delicious! Is there anything else that makes the day special?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we give gifts to children and exchange greetings. We say "Eid Mubarak" to each other, which means "Happy Eid."

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s so heartwarming. It’s great to see how much joy and togetherness it brings. Do you have any favorite memories from past Eids?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, my favorite memory is when I was young, and my family and I went to my grandparents' house. We played games, and my grandparents gave us new clothes and toys.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful time. It’s always special to have those kinds of memories with family. Do you have any plans for the next Eid?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I hope to celebrate with my friends here. We plan to cook some traditional dishes and maybe visit a local mosque if possible.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds lovely! I hope it all goes well. Thanks so much for sharing about Eid-ul-Fitr with me.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome. It was nice to tell you about it.

**Speaker A (NS):** It really was. Maybe we can share more traditions sometime. Talk to you soon, Ayesha!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, talk to you soon. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Ayesha! Take care.
