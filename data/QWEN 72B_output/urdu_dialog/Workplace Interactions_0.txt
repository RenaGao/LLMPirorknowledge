**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal, thanks for joining the meeting today. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. We need to discuss the project deadlines and tasks. Have you had a chance to look over the project brief?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I have. Um, I read it, but some parts are not clear to me.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Let’s go over it together. What parts are you unsure about?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I am not sure about the deadline for the first phase. Is it next week or the week after?

**Speaker A (NS):** The deadline for the first phase is next Friday. We need to submit the initial research findings by then.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I understand. And what are the main tasks for this phase?

**Speaker A (NS):** The main tasks are to gather data, conduct initial interviews, and prepare a draft report. Do you have any specific tasks in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think I can work on gathering data. And, um, how to say... conducting some interviews.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds good. I can help with the report writing. We should also set up a meeting mid-week to review our progress.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is a good idea. When do you suggest we meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about Wednesday at 10 AM? Does that work for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that works for me. I will make sure I am prepared by then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! And let’s also make sure to share our findings and any issues we encounter in the process.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Definitely. I will keep you updated and send you the data I collect.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Thanks, Bilal. I appreciate your effort. Let’s aim to finish this phase smoothly.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I agree. It is important we finish on time. Thank you for the support.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. Have a great day, Bilal. Talk to you soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too. Bye for now.
