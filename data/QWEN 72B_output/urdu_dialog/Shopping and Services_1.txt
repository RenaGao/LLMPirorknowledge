**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Ayesha! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! So, we were talking about buying a new camera. What do you think are the most important features we should look for?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I think... the most important is... how to say... picture quality?

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, picture quality is definitely important. What else?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** And also, it should have... good... um, battery life. Because we want to use it for long time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a great point. Long battery life is crucial, especially if we’re planning to use it for extended periods. What about the zoom capabilities?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, zoom is also important. We should check if it has... um, optical zoom, not just digital zoom.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Optical zoom provides better image quality. How about the camera's size and weight? Do you have any preferences there?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hmm, it should be... not too heavy. I prefer something portable, so we can carry it easily.

**Speaker A (NS):** Portability is a big plus. What about additional features like Wi-Fi or GPS?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Wi-Fi is good for sharing photos quickly. GPS can be useful... for... um, geotagging. So, yes, both are nice to have.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. And what about the brand? Do you have a preference?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I heard good things about Canon and Sony. They are both reliable, I think.

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. Both brands are well-regarded. What about the price range? How much are you thinking to spend?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I want to stay... um, under... 500 dollars, if possible.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's a reasonable budget. I think we can find some good options within that range. Should we start looking online today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that would be great. We can compare different models.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Thanks for your input, Ayesha. Let's get started!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you! I am excited to find a good camera.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Let’s meet online later today to go through the options. Have a great day, Ayesha!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, have a good day! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! See you later.
