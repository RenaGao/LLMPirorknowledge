**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. So, we were thinking about going out tonight. Do you have any ideas for where we could go?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes, I think we can go to a restaurant. Maybe an Italian place? They have very nice food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Italian sounds great! Do you have a specific restaurant in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I heard about a new place near the park. It is called... how to say... ‘La Bella Vita.’ They have good reviews.

**Speaker A (NS):** ‘La Bella Vita’ sounds perfect. What time would you like to go there?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think we can go around seven. That is good time for dinner, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Seven sounds good. And after dinner, do you want to do anything else? Maybe see a movie or go for a walk in the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I like the walk in the park. It is very peaceful in the evening. Or we can go to a café for coffee.

**Speaker A (NS):** A walk in the park sounds nice. It’s a beautiful evening, and the park is always pleasant. What about after the walk?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, after the walk, we can go to a café. There is a nice one near the park. They have good coffee and cakes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great plan! So, dinner at ‘La Bella Vita’ at seven, then a walk in the park, and finally coffee and cakes at the café. Does that sound good to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is perfect. I am looking forward to it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! It’s going to be a great evening. I’ll meet you at the restaurant at seven, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I will be there. Thank you for planning this, Ayesha.

**Speaker A (NS):** My pleasure, Bilal! See you at seven. Have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too, Ayesha. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
