**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Ayesha! How are you today?

**Ayesha (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I heard you’re into reading. Do you have a favorite book?

**Ayesha (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I like reading books very much. My favorite is a book about Urdu poetry. Um... how to say... it is very beautiful and emotional.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! I’d love to read it sometime. What book are you currently reading?

**Ayesha (L2, Urdu):** I am reading a book called “Ghalib: Life and Times.” It is about Mirza Ghalib, a famous Urdu poet. He write very powerful poems.

**Speaker A (NS):** Ghalib is indeed a remarkable poet. If you haven’t already, you might enjoy “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel García Márquez. It’s a classic of magical realism and very rich in storytelling.

**Ayesha (L2, Urdu):** Oh, I have heard about it. Is it difficult to read?

**Speaker A (NS):** Not at all! It’s very engaging and has a unique style that draws you in. The stories are full of magical elements mixed with real-life struggles, which makes it a fascinating read.

**Ayesha (L2, Urdu):** That sounds interesting. Why do you think I should read it?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s a beautiful exploration of family, time, and fate. The writing is poetic and the characters are deeply complex. It can give you a different perspective on storytelling and might inspire you in your own writing.

**Ayesha (L2, Urdu):** Thank you for the recommendation. I will definitely try to read it. Do you have any other suggestions?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! If you like historical fiction, you might enjoy “The Name of the Rose” by Umberto Eco. It’s a mystery set in a medieval monastery and has a lot of depth.

**Ayesha (L2, Urdu):** That sounds good too. I will look into it. Thank you for the suggestions.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! I hope you enjoy them. We can discuss your thoughts on these books next time we meet.

**Ayesha (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that would be great. Thank you so much. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Ayesha! Take care and happy reading!
