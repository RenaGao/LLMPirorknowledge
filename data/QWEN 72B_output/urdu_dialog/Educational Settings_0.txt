**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Ayesha! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I noticed you had a question about the assignment. What do you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, thank you. I am a bit confuse about the... um, the research paper topic. The professor say we should choose something from the last few lecture, but I am not sure what to pick.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. Let’s go over it. Can you tell me what topics were covered in the last few lectures?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, we talk about... um, the industrial revolution, and also, um, the impact of technology on society.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, those are great topics. For the industrial revolution, you could focus on how it changed labor conditions or the economy. For technology, you could look at something specific like the impact of smartphones or social media.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I like the idea about the impact of smartphones. But, um, how to narrow down the topic? It is very big.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good point. You could focus on a specific aspect, like how smartphones have affected communication or education. What interests you the most about smartphones?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think, um, how they change the way we communicate. It is very interesting.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great choice. You could explore how smartphones have made communication faster and more accessible, but also how they might have some negative effects, like reduced face-to-face interaction.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I see. It is good idea. But, um, how to start the research?

**Speaker A (NS):** Start by finding some recent articles and studies on the topic. You can use the library’s database or online resources. Make sure to look for credible sources.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, I will try. And, um, the professor mention we should use at least five sources. Is it enough?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, five sources is a good number. It will give you a solid foundation for your paper. Make sure to read a variety of sources, like journal articles, books, and reputable websites.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you very much. I feel more clear now. I will start my research today.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to help. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Good luck with your research!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, I appreciate it. Have a nice day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too! Take care.
