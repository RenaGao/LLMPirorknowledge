**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Bilal, how are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, hello Ayesha. I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. Have you started preparing for the upcoming exam?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I have started a little bit. But I not sure how to study effectively. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve been reviewing my notes and going over the practice questions from the textbook. It helps me a lot.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Practice questions, that sound good. But I think I need more. Maybe I can read some extra books.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. The library has a lot of resources. Have you visited the new library yet?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I went yesterday. The environment there is very nice. I took some history books and a new storybook.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s cool. I’m planning to read some books on Urdu poetry. But I’m also struggling to find time.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, time is big problem. But if we make time, everything is possible, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Why don’t we study together? We can go to the library tomorrow and help each other.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** That is a good idea. I would like to come with you. What time you want to meet?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about we meet in the afternoon? Say, around 2 PM?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, 2 PM is perfect. I will see you at the library then.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll meet you there. See you tomorrow!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** See you tomorrow. Thank you, Ayesha.
