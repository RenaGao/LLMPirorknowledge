**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! I’m looking at this beautiful rug. Can you tell me more about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello! Ah, yes, this rug is very nice. It is handwoven. Made in Pakistan. Very... how to say... strong.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to know. It looks really well-made. What’s the price?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** The price is... um, 150 dollars.

**Speaker A (NS):** 150 dollars, huh? That’s a bit steep for me. Could you do a bit better?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, um, I can give you a little discount. How about 140 dollars?

**Speaker A (NS):** 140 is still a bit high. I was thinking more along the lines of 120 dollars. That would be fair for both of us.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, 120 is a bit low. Um, let me see... How about 130 dollars?

**Speaker A (NS):** 130 is closer, but I think 125 dollars would be a fair price. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ok, 125 dollars, yes. I can do that for you. It is good deal.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Thank you. It’s a deal. Can you help me wrap it up?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, of course. I will wrap it for you. It will be ready in a moment.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s very kind of you. Do you have any other items I should consider? Maybe something smaller?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we have small tapestries and some handmade cushions. They are also very nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll take a look. Thanks for showing me the rug and for the discount.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome. I hope you find something else you like. Thank you for coming to our shop.

**Speaker A (NS):** I appreciate it. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too. Take care!
