**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal! How are you? It's been a while since we last talked.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, Ayesha! I am good, thank you. And how are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What have you been up to lately?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I am busy with... how to say... my studies. I also go to library often. What about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** That's great! I've been working a lot, but I try to find time to read too. What kind of books do you like to read?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I like history books and stories. Um, I read some history books and one new storybook recently. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I enjoy reading Urdu poetry. It's so beautiful. Do you read Urdu poetry too?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I like it very much. But, um, sometimes I don't have time. You know, studies and all.

**Speaker A (NS):** I know what you mean. It's hard to find time, but it's worth it. Have you made any plans for the weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Not yet. I have some work to do, but maybe I will go to library again. You should come with me sometime. It is very quiet there, good for study.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great idea! I would love to. Maybe we can plan a visit next weekend.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that would be nice. We can meet in afternoon, see each other there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I'll look forward to it. Is there anything else you want to catch up on?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** No, I think that's it. Thank you for calling, Ayesha. It was nice talking to you.

**Speaker A (NS):** It was nice talking to you too, Bilal. Take care and talk to you soon!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, take care. Bye bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye!
