**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Ayesha, thanks for coming in today. How are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello, I am fine, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. We need to discuss the upcoming project deadline. Can you tell me what you have in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, yes. The deadline is next week, right? I think we should finish... um, how to say... the main parts of the project by Thursday.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds reasonable. What are the main parts you're referring to?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** The, um... the report and the presentation. I will also work on the data analysis part.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. How much time do you think you need for each part?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** For the report, maybe two days. And for the presentation, one day. The data analysis, um, one and a half days.

**Speaker A (NS):** That adds up to about four and a half days. Do you think that’s doable?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I think so. But, um, I need some help with the data analysis. It is… complicated.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help you with that. What specific areas do you need assistance with?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** The, um… the statistical models. I am not very… how to say… confident in this area.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fine. We can work through it together. Let’s plan to meet on Tuesday for that. Is that okay with you?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is good. I will prepare some questions for Tuesday.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. And let’s review the final report and presentation on Thursday afternoon.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is a good plan. I will, um, start working on the report today.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great. If you have any issues, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’ll check in with you later this week.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you. I will, um, keep you updated. Goodbye.

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye, Ayesha. Have a good day!
