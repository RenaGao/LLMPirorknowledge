**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Bilal! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hi, I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. So, we have a study group meeting today. What topic are you preparing to explain?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I am preparing to explain the concept of, um... photosynthesis, you know, how plants make their food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great topic! Do you feel confident about it, or are there any parts that are tricky?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, some parts are tricky. I think the, um... the chemical reactions, they are a little confusing.

**Speaker A (NS):** I understand. Let’s break it down. The main idea is that plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. Can you explain how they do that?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, so, plants have this, um, green thing in their cells, called... chlorophyll. Chlorophyll, it um... it captures the sunlight.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And then what happens next?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Then, the sunlight, it, um... helps to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen, it is used to make glucose, and oxygen is released as, um, waste.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good explanation. Just to be clear, the hydrogen from water and the carbon dioxide from the air combine to form glucose. The oxygen is released as a byproduct.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is right. So, the chemical reaction is, um... 6 CO2 plus 6 H2O plus light energy, it makes, um... C6H12O6 plus 6 O2.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! You’ve got it. The equation is 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2. It’s a bit of a mouthful, but it’s important to remember.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I will practice more. I think if I keep saying it, I will remember it better.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. Do you want to go over any other parts of photosynthesis?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, I think, the, um... stages of photosynthesis. There are two main stages, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, there are two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Oh, I see. So, in the light-dependent reactions, um... the light energy is used to make ATP and NADPH. And in the light-independent reactions, um... the, the, how to say... the cycle, it uses ATP and NADPH to make glucose.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH), and the light-independent reactions use that energy to fix carbon dioxide into glucose. You’ve got it!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, I think I understand now. It is much clearer.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that. If you have any more questions, don’t hesitate to ask. Good luck with your explanation in the study group!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thanks a lot. See you in the group. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Bilal. Bye!
