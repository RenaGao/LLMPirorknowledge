**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Ah, hello! I am good, thank you. And you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I was thinking, have you ever noticed any interesting differences in dining etiquette between Pakistan and here?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, um, there are many differences. In Pakistan, we usually eat... um, how to say... with hands.

**Speaker A (NS):** Eating with your hands? That’s interesting. Is that common everywhere?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is very common, especially for, um, traditional food. But in restaurants, we use cutlery.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. And what about seating arrangements? Do you have any specific customs?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** In Pakistan, we often sit on floor, um, on cushions. It is more, um, comfortable and, how to say, family-style.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sitting on cushions sounds cozy. Do you have any rules about who sits where?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Usually, the oldest person sits at the head of the table, and, um, guests are given the best seats.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice tradition. What about in formal settings, like business dinners?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** In formal settings, we, um, follow more Western-style dining. We use tables and chairs, and, um, the host often sits at the end of the table.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. How about sharing food? Is that common in Pakistani culture?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, sharing food is very common. We often put all the dishes in the center, and everyone takes, um, what they like.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really nice. Do you have any specific rules about serving food?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we usually serve, um, the guests and children first, and then, um, the host and older people.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a thoughtful tradition. Do you find it different here in the way people serve and eat?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is different. Here, everyone usually serves themselves, and, um, sometimes, people eat in silence, which is, um, not common in Pakistan.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s true. In many Western cultures, it’s more individualistic. Do you miss the communal dining experience?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, I do miss it. It is more, um, fun and, how to say, close with family and friends.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can understand that. It’s nice to have those connections. Thanks for sharing all this, Bilal. It’s really interesting to learn about these cultural differences.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You are welcome. I am glad you find it, um, interesting. Maybe, um, we can try a Pakistani meal together sometime?

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great! I’d love to. Let’s plan it soon.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, let’s do that. Thanks for, um, the chat. It was, um, very nice.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Bilal. Take care, and talk to you soon!
