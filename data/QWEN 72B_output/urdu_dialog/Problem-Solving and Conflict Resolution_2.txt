**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Bilal! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Hello, Ayesha. I am good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. We need to talk about the project deadline. It’s coming up soon, and we need to make sure we’re on track.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, it is important. We have many work to do.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right. Let’s start by listing the tasks we still need @@
to complete. Can you share what you have on your list?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Okay, um... I need to finish the report for the market analysis. And also, I have to prepare the presentation slides.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. I’m working on the financial summary and the executive summary. We should probably start with the report first. When can you have that done?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Um, if I work hard, maybe by Thursday. But I need some data from you for the financial part.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can send that to you by tomorrow. That should give you enough time to incorporate it. What about the presentation slides?

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** I think I can start those on Friday. But how to say... I need your input on the key points to highlight.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Let’s plan to review the slides together on Monday. We can go through them and make sure everything is clear and concise.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, that is good plan. I will send you the draft slides by Sunday evening.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. And if we have any issues or questions along the way, let’s make sure to communicate clearly and quickly.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Yes, we should keep in touch. It is important for good teamwork.

**Speaker A (NS):** Agreed. Let’s also set a reminder for our meeting on Monday to review the slides.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Good idea. I will set reminder on my phone.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great. Thanks, Bilal. I’m confident we can get this done on time if we stay organized.

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** Thank you, Ayesha. I am also confident. We make good team.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. Talk to you soon, and have a good day!

**Speaker B (L2, Urdu):** You too, have a good day! Goodbye.
