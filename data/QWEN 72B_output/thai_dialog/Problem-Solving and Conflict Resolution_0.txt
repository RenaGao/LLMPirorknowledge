**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Lek, how are you doing?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi, I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. We had a bit of a misunderstanding last week, and I wanted to clear the air.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, yes. I also want to talk about it. I think... um... communication, it not good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I agree. I felt like we had a bit of a miscommunication. Can you tell me what you thought happened?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, when we plan to go to Chatuchak Park, I think you not want to go. You say, "Maybe," but I feel you not happy.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. I didn't mean to give that impression. The truth is, I was excited about going to the park. I just had a bit of a busy week and was a little tired.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, I see. You have many work to do?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I had a lot on my plate. I should have been clearer about how I was feeling. I didn't mean to make you think I didn't want to go.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I understand. Next time, can you tell me if you not feel good?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I will. And I really am sorry if I made you feel that way. I value our friendship and I want us to have fun together.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No problem. I also sorry if I make you feel bad. We friends, we can talk about this.

**Speaker A (NS):** That's the spirit! So, how about we still go to the park this weekend? I promise I'll be more energetic.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is good idea! I will bring some snacks and drinks.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! I'll bring some drinks too. Let's meet at 8:30 in the morning, okay?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, 8:30 is good. I will be there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I'm looking forward to it. Thanks for talking this out with me, Lek.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Me too. Thank you. See you Saturday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you then! Take care!
