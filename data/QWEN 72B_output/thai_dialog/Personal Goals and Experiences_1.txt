**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks! I heard you have a new skill you want to learn. Can you tell me about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um... I want to learn how to, uh, make Thai desserts. It is... very important for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! Why is learning to make Thai desserts important to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Well, I, um... my grandmother, she make very yummy desserts. I want to, uh, learn from her and, um, keep the tradition.

**Speaker A (NS):** Keeping family traditions is really special. What kind of Thai desserts are you interested in making?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I want to make, uh, khanom tom, it is, um... sticky rice ball with, uh, sweet bean paste. And also, um, mango sticky rice.

**Speaker A (NS):** Those both sound delicious! Have you ever tried making them before?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I never make it, but I watch, um, my grandmother many times. I think it is... not easy, but I want to try.

**Speaker A (NS):** It's always a good challenge to try something new. Do you plan to take any classes or learn from recipes online?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think I will, um, start with, uh, recipes online. And maybe ask my grandmother for, um, tips and, uh, help.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great plan! Do you have a specific goal in mind for when you start making these desserts?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I want to, um, make them for, uh, New Year's celebration. It is, um, special time for family.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a wonderful goal! It will be a great way to share the tradition with your family. Do you think you’ll need any special ingredients?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I need, um, sticky rice, coconut milk, and, uh, beans. I will, um, buy them from, uh, Asian market.

**Speaker A (NS):** The Asian market is a great place to find those ingredients. I’m sure your family will love the desserts you make. When do you plan to start?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I will start, um, next week. I am, uh, excited and, um, a little nervous.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s perfectly normal! I’m sure you’ll do great. Any last thoughts or questions before we wrap up?
