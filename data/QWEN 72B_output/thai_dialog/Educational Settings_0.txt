**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello, I am good, thank you. How to say... I have question about homework.

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What do you need help with?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I not understand, um, the essay question. It say, "Discuss the impact of social media on communication." I not know what they mean by "impact."

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, I can help with that. "Impact" means the effect or influence that something has. So, the question is asking you to talk about how social media changes the way people communicate.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, I see. So, I need to write about good and bad things of social media on communication?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! You can discuss both positive and negative effects. For example, social media makes it easier to stay in touch with friends and family, but it can also lead to misunderstandings or oversharing.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, understand. And how many words should I write?

**Speaker A (NS):** The assignment instructions say it should be around 500 to 700 words. Make sure to include examples and maybe some statistics to support your points.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I will do that. And, um, should I use books or internet for research?

**Speaker A (NS):** Both are fine! Books can provide a more in-depth look, but the internet has a lot of current examples and studies. Just make sure to use reliable sources.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Right, I will check. And, how to write introduction?

**Speaker A (NS):** A good introduction should hook the reader and provide a brief overview of what you’ll discuss. You can start with a interesting fact or quote about social media, then state your main points.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I see. I will start with statistic. Did you know, 3.8 billion people use social media? This is more than half of world population.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great statistic to start with! It really sets the stage. And then you can mention the main points you’ll cover in your essay.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, thank you. I feel more confident now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I will. Thank you very much for helping me.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Nuch! Good luck with your essay. See you in class!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you, see you!
