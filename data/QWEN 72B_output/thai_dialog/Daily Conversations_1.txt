**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Lek, what are you up to this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I am free, yes. What do you want to do?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could go to Chatuchak Park. I’d like to stroll around and do some shopping. How about that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, that sound good! The weather is nice now. We can go early morning, no hot.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, let’s do that. Early morning sounds perfect. What time works for you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... 8:30, is it okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** 8:30 is great! I’ll bring some drinks. Do you want to bring anything?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I bring some snacks. We can eat there, no?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, that sounds like a good idea. Do you have any favorite snacks?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like to bring... um, how you say... sticky rice and mango. It is delicious, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sticky rice and mango? That sounds amazing! I’ve never tried it before.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You will like it, I think. It is very Thai food.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can’t wait to try it. Should we meet at the park entrance?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, at the entrance. I will be there early.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, see you at 8:30 then. Have a good rest of your week!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! You too. See you Saturday morning!

**Speaker A (NS):** Alright, see you then! Bye!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Bye!
