**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Nuch! How’s it going? Are you ready for the upcoming test?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I am good, thank you. Um, test... I am not so ready yet. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I feel the same. Have you started studying at all?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** A little bit. I read book and make note, but not much. How you prepare?

**Speaker A (NS):** I usually start by making a study schedule. It helps me stay organized and cover everything. Do you want to try that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, good idea. How to, uh, make schedule?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! First, list all the topics you need to study. Then, break them down into smaller parts and assign specific times to each part. For example, you can study one chapter in the morning and another in the evening.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I see. So, I need to plan what I study each day. And how much time for each topic?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! That way, you won’t feel overwhelmed. Also, try to take breaks every hour to rest your mind.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, take break... how long?

**Speaker A (NS):** About 10 to 15 minutes. It helps you stay focused when you study.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I see. And also, um, how to remember all information?

**Speaker A (NS):** One good method is making flashcards. You can write key terms on one side and definitions on the other. It’s a great way to test yourself.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Flashcard... I try that before. It work good. Thank you for tip.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Another tip is to study with a friend. You can quiz each other and discuss difficult topics.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like that idea. Maybe, uh, we can study together sometime?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great plan! When are you free?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I free, um, tomorrow afternoon. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Tomorrow afternoon works for me. Let’s meet at the library at 2?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, 2 o’clock. I will see you there.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! See you then. Good luck with your studying!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! You too. Bye, see you tomorrow!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Nuch!
