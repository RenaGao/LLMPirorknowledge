**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Nuch! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I am fine, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm good, thanks. We need to plan a team meeting this week. Do you have any ideas for the agenda?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes. Um, we should talk about... um, how to say... project update, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. Project updates are important. Anything else you think we should cover?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe, um, team goals for next month. And also, um, any problem we have, we can discuss it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great point. Discussing problems and setting team goals are essential. What about the meeting time? Any preferences?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think, um, Thursday morning is good. Not too early, maybe 10 o'clock?

**Speaker A (NS):** 10 o'clock sounds perfect. Where should we hold the meeting?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** In the conference room? It is big enough for everyone.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, the conference room is a good choice. Should we send out an email to confirm the details?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is a good idea. I can, um, write the email if you want.

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great, thank you. Can you include the agenda we discussed?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure. I will write it and send it to everyone. Is there anything else we need to do?

**Speaker A (NS):** I don’t think so. We’ve covered everything. Thanks for your help, Nuch.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You are welcome. I will, um, make sure everything is ready. See you Thursday!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you Thursday. Thanks again! Bye!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Bye!
