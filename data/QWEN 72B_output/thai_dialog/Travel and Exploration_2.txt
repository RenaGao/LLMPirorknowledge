**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! It’s great to see you. How’s your day going?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi, it’s good. Thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. I’m actually new to this town and I’m trying to find my way around. Could you help me with directions to the old town square?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes, I can. Old town square, it is... how to say... very famous place here.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great! Where should I start from?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You can start from the bus station. It is near here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, from the bus station, which way should I go?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You go straight, and then turn left at the big tree. Big tree, you will see.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. And then what?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** After big tree, you go straight again. You will see the market. Then, you turn right at the market.

**Speaker A (NS):** So, I go straight, turn left at the big tree, go straight again, and turn right at the market. Is that right?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that right. You will see the old town square after market. It is very beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds perfect! How far is it from here?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It is not far. Maybe, um, 15 minute walk.

**Speaker A (NS):** 15 minutes, got it. Is there anything else I should know on the way?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, not really. Just follow the direction I tell. You will find it easy.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great, thank you so much for your help, Nuch! I really appreciate it.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You welcome. I hope you enjoy old town square. It is very nice place.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure I will. Thanks again. See you around!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** See you! Have good day!
