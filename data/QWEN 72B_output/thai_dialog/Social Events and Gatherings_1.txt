**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. Listen, I have an idea. What do you think about planning a surprise party for Lek?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, good idea! Lek he will love it. When we do it?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this weekend? We can invite a few close friends and keep it simple.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, this weekend is good. Um, where we should have the party?

**Speaker A (NS):** What about at my place? I have a big living room and a nice backyard.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, your place is perfect. What time we start?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let's say around 7:00 PM. That way, everyone can finish work and come over.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** 7:00 PM, good. Um, how we keep it secret from Lek?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question. We can tell him I need help with something at my place, like fixing a, um, a thing for hanging pictures.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** A frame? Hmm, yes, that is good. We can say we help you, and then surprise him!

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And we can decorate the place beforehand. Do you want to bring some snacks?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure, I can bring some snacks and drinks. What kind of snacks you like?

**Speaker A (NS):**Anything is fine, but maybe some finger foods like sandwiches and chips?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will make sandwiches and bring chips. And some fruit too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll take care of the drinks. Do you want to help with the guest list?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I can send message to our friends. Who we invite?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s invite May, Tom, and Aun. They are close to Lek.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, they are good friends. I will send message now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. And I’ll set up the decorations. This is going to be a lot of fun!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, it will be very fun! Thanks for organizing this.

**Speaker A (NS ''; pause''):** No problem, it’s my pleasure. I’ll see you this weekend, then?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, see you this weekend. Thank you again!

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! Have a great day, Nuch! Bye!
