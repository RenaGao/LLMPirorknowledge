**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Lek! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. So, we’re planning a birthday surprise for Nuch this weekend. Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yeah. I think we can go to park, like Chatuchak. We can have picnic there.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great idea! What about decorations or a theme?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, we can use... um, colorful balloons and banners. And we can bring snacks and drinks for picnic.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Do you want to help with the shopping?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I can do that. I will buy some snacks and drinks. And maybe some small gift for Nuch.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome! We should also write a card. Do you want to contribute a message?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure, I write message in Thai. It will be nice surprise for her.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! When should we meet to set everything up?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, how about Friday after work? We can meet at 6 p.m.

**Speaker A (NS):** 6 p.m. works for me. Where should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Let’s meet at the entrance of Chatuchak Park. It easy to find.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! And we should make sure Nuch doesn’t know about it, right?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, of course. We keep it secret until we surprise her.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! Is there anything else we need to plan?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think we cover everything. We just need to make sure everyone is on time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, I’ll send out a reminder to the group. Thanks for your help, Lek!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No problem. I excited for the surprise.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! See you Friday at 6 p.m. at Chatuchak Park.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** See you then! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye! Have a great day!
