**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Nuch! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I am good. How are you, um, how to say... today?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks for asking! So, I was thinking about planning a weekend picnic with our families. What do you think?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, that sound nice. I like picnic. When you want to go?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about this Saturday? The weather is supposed to be really nice.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Saturday, that good. Where you want to go?

**Speaker A (NS):** There’s a beautiful park near my house. It’s called Riverside Park. Do you know it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I no know. But, um, how to say... I can look it up. It’s okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! I can also send you the address. What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** How about, um, ten o'clock? That okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ten o'clock sounds perfect. Will you bring any food?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will bring some Thai food. Um, like... sandwiches and fruit. What you bring?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ll bring some drinks and maybe some snacks. Do you have any special snacks in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like chips and, um, chocolate. How to say... chocolate cookies?

**Speaker A (NS):** Chocolate cookies sound great! Should we bring any games or activities?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I think we can bring, um, Frisbee and, how to say... board games?

**Speaker A (NS):** Frisbee and board games are perfect. Do you have any specific board games in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I no have. But we can borrow from, um, the store near my house.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. I’ll check if they have any fun games.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that good. I think we will have fun.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sure we will! Let’s confirm everything: we’re meeting at Riverside Park on Saturday at ten o'clock, and we’re bringing food, drinks, snacks, and games.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that right. I will, um, tell my family too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll send you the address and a reminder. See you Saturday!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** See you Saturday! Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Nuch! Have a great day!
