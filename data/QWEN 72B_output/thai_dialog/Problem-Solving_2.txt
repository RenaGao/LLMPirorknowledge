**Speaker A (NS):** Hi Nuch, how are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi, I good, thank you. How you are?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I wanted to talk to you about a small issue. I made a mistake in our last meeting.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, what kind of mistake?

**Speaker A (NS):** I mixed up the dates for the project deadline. It's actually next Tuesday, not this Friday.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I see. This is... how to say... not good. We need more time to finish, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. I’m really sorry about that. I should have double-checked the dates.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No problem, I understand. Mistake can happen. What we can do now?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve talked to the team, and we can extend the deadline by a week. That should give us enough time to complete everything.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That is good solution. Team will be happy. We will work hard to finish by new date.

**Speaker A (NS):** I really appreciate your understanding. Is there anything else we need to discuss about the project?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think is good now. We just need to tell everyone new date, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I’ll send out an email to the team to let them know. 

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** That is fine. Thank you for tell me and fix problem.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I’m glad we could resolve it. 

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, me too. Thank you, see you next meeting.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, see you then. Take care, Nuch!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too, take care! Bye!
