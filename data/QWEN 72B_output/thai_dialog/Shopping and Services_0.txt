**Speaker A (NS):** Hi there! Welcome to our store. How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello. Um, I want to buy... um, gift for my friend. Can you help me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course! What kind of gift are you thinking about? Something for their home, or maybe something for their hobby?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, how to say... I think something nice for their home. My friend love to cook and eat.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great choice! We have a variety of kitchen items and cookware. What about a nice set of knives or a high-quality cookware set?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, knives sound good. But, um, I not sure which one is best. Can you show me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure thing! Let me show you our selection. These are our most popular knives. They are made of high-quality steel and come with a nice wooden block.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** They look very nice. Um, how much is this set?

**Speaker A (NS):** This set is $120. It’s a great value for the quality.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, that is bit expensive. Do you have any cheaper option?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! We have this set over here. It’s a bit more affordable at $80 and still very durable.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** This one look good too. Um, can I hold it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Certainly! Here you go. Feel how well-balanced it is.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** It feels very good. I think my friend will like it. I will take this one.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent choice! I’ll get it wrapped for you. Anything else you need?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** No, I think that is all. Thank you so much for help.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re very welcome! If you need any more assistance, just let me know. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you. You too. Goodbye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Goodbye! Enjoy your day!
