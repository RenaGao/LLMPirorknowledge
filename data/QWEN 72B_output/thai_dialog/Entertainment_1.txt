**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Nuch! How are you? What are you up to this weekend?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hello! I am good. Thank you. Um, not much. How to say... I have no plan. What about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing okay too. I was thinking we could plan something fun for this weekend. Any ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I have idea. How about we go... um, how to say... eat out? And then, we can do something fun after?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds great! Do you have a favorite restaurant in mind?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I like Thai food. There is one... how to say... near my house. It is very good.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I know the place! It’s called Sukhothai, right? I’ve heard great things about it. What do you think about going there?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, sukho—Sukhothai! That is it. I think it is good. When we should go?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about Saturday evening? Say, 7:00 PM?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, 7:00 PM is good. And then, we can do something... um, fun after?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! What do you have in mind? Maybe a movie or a walk in the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I like... um, how to say... walk in park. But, if you want, we can see movie too.

**Speaker A (NS):** A walk in the park sounds nice. Let’s do that! We can go to the park after dinner and enjoy the evening.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, very good idea. I will bring... um, snack. We can eat in park.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! I’ll bring some drinks too. It will be a perfect evening.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, perfect! I am excited. See you Saturday evening at 7:00 PM, yes?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, see you then! Have a good day, Nuch!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Bye-bye!
