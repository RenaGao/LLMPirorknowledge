**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! Thanks for coming in today. I wanted to go over the process of setting up a new project on our platform. Are you free to chat now?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! Yes, I free. What do you need to explain?

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! So, the first step is to create a new project folder. You can do this by clicking on the "Create Project" button on the dashboard. Then, you’ll need to name the project and select the appropriate project type.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I see. Then, what I need to do after that?

**Speaker A (NS):** After naming the project and selecting the type, you’ll need to set up the project’s permissions. This involves adding team members and assigning roles, like project manager or developer.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, I understand. How to add team member?

**Speaker A (NS):** To add a team member, click on the "Add Member" button. You can enter their email address and choose their role from the dropdown menu. Then, just click "Save."

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Got it. And then, we need to assign task?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly. Once the team members are added, you can start assigning tasks. Go to the "Tasks" section, create a new task, and assign it to the appropriate team member. Make sure to set deadlines and any necessary details.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Okay, I think I understand. How we make sure everyone know their task?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! You can use the "Notifications" feature to send out reminders. Also, regular check-ins and status updates during team meetings will help keep everyone on track.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Ah, that make sense. And, um, how to do the check-in?

**Speaker A (NS):** For check-ins, you can use our project management tool to track progress. During meetings, each team member can report on their tasks and any issues they’re facing. It’s a good idea to document these updates for future reference.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I see. I will try to follow this step. Is there anything else I need to know?

**Speaker A (NS):** That covers the basics! If you have any questions or run into any issues, just let me know. I’m here to help.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! I really appreciate it. I think I can manage it now.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’m glad you feel confident. Let’s touch base next week to see how things are going. Sound good?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that very good. Thank you again.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome, Nuch. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You too! Goodbye!
