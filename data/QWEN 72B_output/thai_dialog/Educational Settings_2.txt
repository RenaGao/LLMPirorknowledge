**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Nuch, how’s it going?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I’m good, thank you. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m doing well, thanks. We’re going to discuss the topic of photosynthesis today. Do you know what photosynthesis is?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um, yes. It is... how plant make food, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! It’s the process where plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Do you know the main components involved?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think... um, sun, water, and... carbon dioxide. And plant make... sugar and oxygen.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s correct! Sunlight, water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) are converted into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). Do you know where this process happens in the plant?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Um... in the leaf?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, specifically in the chloroplasts, which are the green parts of the leaves. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, which captures sunlight.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Chlorophyll... it is what make plant green, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, exactly! Chlorophyll absorbs light energy and uses it to convert the other components into glucose and oxygen. So, can you summarize the key points for the group?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure. Photosynthesis is plant make food using sun, water, and carbon dioxide. It happen in chloroplast in leaf. Chlorophyll help capture sun.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great summary! And the final products are glucose and oxygen. Is there anything else you want to add or ask about?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** I think I understand. But, how plant use glucose?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good question! Plants use glucose for energy and to build new parts, like leaves, stems, and roots. They also store glucose in fruits and seeds.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Oh, I see. Thank you for explain. I will tell the group.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Good luck with your presentation!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thank you! See you next time.

**Speaker A (NS):** Take care, Nuch! Bye!
