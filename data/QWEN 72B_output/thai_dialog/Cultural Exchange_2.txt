**Speaker A (NS):** Hi, Nuch! How are you today?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I'm doing well, thanks. I wanted to ask you about your favorite holiday in Thailand. Can you tell me about it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure! My favorite holiday is Songkran. It is Thai New Year, celebrate in April.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds interesting! What do people usually do during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** People go to temple, pour water on Buddha statue for good luck. Also, we have big water fight in street. Is very fun!

**Speaker A (NS):** A water fight sounds really fun! Do you have any special traditions with your family during Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we go to my grandparent's house. We pay respect to them, and they give us blessing. We also cook traditional food together.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a wonderful time. What kind of traditional food do you cook?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We cook Kanom Jeen, it is noodle with green curry. And also, we make Mango Sticky Rice. It is very delicious!

**Speaker A (NS):** Mango Sticky Rice is one of my favorites! How do you make it?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** We cook sticky rice, mix it with coconut milk and sugar. Then, we put fresh mango on top. It is sweet and cool, perfect for Songkran.

**Speaker A (NS):** It sounds amazing! I'd love to try it. Do you celebrate Songkran outside of Thailand as well?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, we have Songkran festival in many cities. Even in other countries, people celebrate. But it is not same as in Thailand, of course.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can imagine. It must be a bit different, but still fun. Do you have any plans for this year's Songkran?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Maybe we will have small party at home. We invite some friends, and we can have water fight in backyard.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a great plan! I hope you have a lot of fun. Thanks for sharing all this with me, Nuch.

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** You are welcome! I happy to share. Maybe next year, you come to Thailand for Songkran?

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be amazing! Iâ€™ll definitely consider it. Thanks again, Nuch. See you later!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Bye! See you!
