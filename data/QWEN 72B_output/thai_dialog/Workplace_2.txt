**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Nuch, thanks for joining me today! I wanted to go over a new task we have for the weekend. Are you free this Saturday?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I am free. What is it about?

**Speaker A (NS):** We're planning a trip to Chatuchak Park. I thought it would be nice to stroll around and do some shopping. Are you interested?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I am. The weather is good these days.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! Let's go early so it won't be too hot. What time should we meet?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Eight thirty is good for me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Do you want to bring anything with you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, I will bring some food. You can bring drinks, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds good! I'll prepare some drinks. So, we meet at 8:30 at the park entrance?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that is correct.

**Speaker A (NS):** Now, about the task. We need to organize a list of items to bring. Can you help me with that?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Sure, I can help. What do we need to bring?

**Speaker A (NS):** We should bring a camera, sunblock, and some snacks. Do you have any other ideas?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, um... we should bring an umbrella, just in case. And maybe a small bag for shopping.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great suggestions! Should we also bring a map of the park?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, a map is good. We can find the best spots to visit.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let's write it down. Camera, sunblock, snacks, umbrella, small bag, and a map. Does that sound complete to you?

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Yes, that sounds good. We have everything we need.

**Speaker A (NS):** Excellent! I'll send you a reminder message on Friday. See you Saturday morning!

**Speaker B (L2, Thai):** Thanks! See you Saturday. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye, Nuch! Have a great day!
