**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie! How’s it going?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey, Sarah! Not bad, just a bit stressed about the upcoming test. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here. It’s coming up fast, and I’m trying to get a study plan in place. Do you have any tips?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, I’ve been doing a lot of practice tests. They really help me remember the material better.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a good idea. I usually make flashcards, but I might try some practice tests too. Have you found any resources that are particularly helpful?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, definitely. The online course website has some great practice questions. Also, the study group we joined last semester is still active and super helpful.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome. I’ll check those out. How do you manage your time when you’re studying? I always end up cramming the night before.

**Speaker B (NS):** I try to break it up into smaller chunks. I’ll study for an hour or so, then take a 15-minute break. It keeps me from burning out.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a good strategy. I might try setting a timer. Do you have any other advice for staying focused?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, I find it helps to study in a quiet place, and I also like to use the Pomodoro technique. It’s where you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. It really keeps me on track.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve heard of that! I’ll give it a try. Thanks for the tips, Jamie. They’re really helpful.

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem, Sarah. I’m glad I could help. We should maybe study together sometime this week to stay on track.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. Let’s plan on meeting up tomorrow after class. We can go over some practice questions and review notes.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds perfect. I’ll bring the flashcards I made. See you then!

**Speaker A (NS):** See you tomorrow, Jamie. Thanks again, and good luck with your studying!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too, Sarah. Take care and see you later!
