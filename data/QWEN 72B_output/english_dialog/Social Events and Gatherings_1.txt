**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Emma! How are you doing today?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey, Jamie! I’m good, thanks for asking. What’s up? You sounded pretty excited on the phone.

**Speaker A (NS):** I am! I have a fun idea. We should plan a surprise party for Sarah’s birthday next month. What do you think?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, that’s a great idea! Sarah will love it. Do you have any specific themes or ideas in mind?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I was thinking we could do something beach-themed since she’s been talking about how much she misses the beach. Plus, it’s a good excuse to have a summer vibe even if we’re not at the beach.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds perfect! We could decorate with palm trees, seashells, and maybe even have a sand pit for a mini beach experience. What about the venue?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could use the community center’s event room. It’s big enough for all our friends and has a kitchen for catering. Plus, it’s centrally located.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s a good point. We should check the availability and book it as soon as possible. Who else do you think we should invite?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely Sarah’s closest friends from college, her coworkers, and maybe a few family members. We should make a list and send out invitations a couple of weeks in advance.

**Speaker B (NS):** Agreed. We can use a digital invite to keep it simple and eco-friendly. What about the food and drinks? Any ideas?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could have a tropical fruit platter, some seafood snacks, and maybe a piña colada bar. We can ask a local caterer to help with the main dishes.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds amazing! We could also have a playlist with some beachy tunes to set the mood. Do you want to take charge of the music?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure thing! I’ll create a playlist and share it with everyone. How about you handle the decorations and invitations?

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely, I can do that. We should also think about a fun activity or game to keep everyone entertained.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! Maybe a photo booth with beach-themed props, or a beach ball toss game. We can set up a prize for the winners.

**Speaker B (NS):** Love it! I’ll look into the props and see what we can find. This is going to be so much fun!

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Thanks for all your help, Emma. Let’s touch base next week to finalize everything.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good to me! I’m excited to see it all come together. Talk to you soon, Jamie. Have a great week!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Emma. Take care and see you later!
