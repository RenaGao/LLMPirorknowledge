**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie! How are you doing?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey, Matt! I’m good, thanks for asking. What’s up?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking about planning a trip to a new city with some friends. Any ideas where we should go?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun! What kind of vibe are you going for? Something relaxing or more adventurous?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking maybe a mix of both. Somewhere with good food, some cultural stuff, and maybe some outdoor activities.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s a great combination. Have you considered Portland, Oregon? It’s got a fantastic food scene, a lot of cool local attractions, and it’s close to the outdoors.

**Speaker A (NS):** Portland sounds perfect! I’ve heard it’s really hip and has a lot to offer. What kind of outdoor activities can we do there?

**Speaker B (NS):** You can go hiking in the Columbia River Gorge, visit Mount Hood for some skiing or hiking, and there are some great parks within the city itself, like Forest Park.

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that’s awesome. How about the food scene? Any must-try places?

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely try some of the food carts—they’re a big thing in Portland. And don’t miss out on the local brewpubs and coffee shops. Voodoo Doughnut is a must for some unique and delicious doughnuts.

**Speaker A (NS):** That all sounds amazing! When do you think would be a good time to go?

**Speaker B (NS):** Late spring or early fall would be ideal. The weather is usually mild, and the city isn’t as crowded with tourists.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Let’s aim for early October. That gives us a few months to plan and get everything sorted.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good to me. We should start putting together a list of things to do and places to stay. I can look into some Airbnb options.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea. I’ll start reaching out to the others to see who’s free. Thanks for the suggestions, Jamie!

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem, Matt! I’m looking forward to it. Let’s catch up next week to finalize the plans.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Have a great week, Jamie!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too, Matt! Talk to you soon!
