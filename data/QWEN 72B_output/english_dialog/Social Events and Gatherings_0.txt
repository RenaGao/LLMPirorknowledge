**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, this party is great, isn’t it? I’m Mike. What’s your name?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, it’s a really nice setup. I’m Sarah. Nice to meet you, Mike.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice to meet you too, Sarah. What brings you to this party?

**Speaker B (NS):** I actually know the host from college. We were in the same drama club. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, that’s cool! I’m a friend of Alex, the guy who’s always wearing the red hat. We used to play on the same soccer team.

**Speaker B (NS):** Ah, I see him over there. He’s pretty hard to miss, isn’t he? So, what do you do for a living, Mike?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m a software developer. It’s a bit of a tech grind, but I love it. What about you, Sarah?

**Speaker B (NS):** I work as a marketing manager for a local advertising agency. It’s fast-paced, but I enjoy the creative side of things.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really interesting. Do you get to work on a lot of different projects?

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely. We have a mix of long-term clients and short-term campaigns. It keeps things exciting. How about you? Any big projects on the horizon?

**Speaker A (NS):** Actually, I’m working on a new app that helps people manage their finances. It’s still in the early stages, but I’m pretty excited about it.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s awesome! I could probably use something like that myself. Sounds like it could be really useful.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I hope so. It’s all about making financial management more accessible and user-friendly.

**Speaker B (NS):** I’d love to check it out when it’s ready. Keep me posted, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I will. So, what do you think of the music? It’s pretty good, isn’t it?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, it’s got a great vibe. I was just thinking of grabbing a drink. You want to join me?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure, that sounds like a good idea. Let’s head over to the bar.

**Speaker B (NS):** Great, let’s go. It was really nice meeting you, Mike.

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Sarah. Enjoy the rest of the party! See you around.

**Speaker B (NS):** You too—take care!
