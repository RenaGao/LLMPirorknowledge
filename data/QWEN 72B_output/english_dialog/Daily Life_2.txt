**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, welcome to the apartment! I’m really glad you’re moving in. How about we get to know each other a bit better over a meal? 

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks! I’m excited to be here. I’d love to. What’s your favorite meal to cook?

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I’d have to say my favorite is homemade pizza. It’s a great way to unwind and it’s always fun to customize your toppings.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds amazing! I’ve never made pizza from scratch before. How do you start?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, first, you need to make the dough. I usually buy a packet of yeast, some flour, and a bit of olive oil. Mix them together with warm water and let it rise for about an hour.

**Speaker B (NS):** I see. So, it’s kind of like making bread, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! Once the dough has risen, you punch it down and roll it out into a circle. Then you can add your sauce and toppings.

**Speaker B (NS):** What kind of sauce do you use? Do you make it yourself?

**Speaker A (NS):** I usually make a simple tomato sauce. Just blend some canned tomatoes, add a bit of garlic, salt, and some herbs like basil or oregano. It’s pretty straightforward.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s really cool. And for toppings, do you have any favorites?

**Speaker A (NS):** I love a classic Margherita with just tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and a few basil leaves. But sometimes I get creative with things like pepperoni, mushrooms, or even grilled chicken.

**Speaker B (NS):** Yum, that all sounds delicious. I might have to try making it myself sometime.

**Speaker A (NS):** You definitely should! It’s a lot of fun and you can experiment with different flavors.

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m looking forward to it. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem! We should plan a pizza night soon. How does that sound?

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds perfect! Let’s pick a date this week and make it happen.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great! I’ll send you a text later to confirm. It’s going to be a lot of fun.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good to me. Thanks again, and I’m really excited to be here.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too! Welcome home. See you later!

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks! Take care!
