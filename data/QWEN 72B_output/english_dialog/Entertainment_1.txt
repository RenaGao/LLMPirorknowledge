**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for meeting up! I was thinking we could plan an evening out this weekend. Any ideas?

**Speaker B (NS):** Sure, sounds fun! I was actually thinking about trying out that new Italian place downtown. What do you think?

**Speaker A (NS):** Italian sounds great! I’ve heard their pasta is amazing. Do they have any other dishes you’re excited about?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, definitely the risotto and their seafood platter. And I heard they have a really good wine selection too.

**Speaker A (NS):** Nice! That definitely makes it more appealing. What about after dinner? Any thoughts on what we could do?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, there’s that new exhibit at the art museum. We could check that out, or maybe catch a movie?

**Speaker A (NS):** The art exhibit sounds interesting. What kind of exhibit is it?

**Speaker B (NS):** It’s a contemporary art exhibit featuring local artists. I’ve been meaning to check it out for a while, and I think it could be a cool experience.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. I love contemporary art. What time should we plan to go to the restaurant?

**Speaker B (NS):** How about 7:00 PM? That should give us enough time to enjoy dinner and then head over to the museum around 9:00 or 9:30.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, 7:00 PM it is. Do you want to meet there, or should we go together?

**Speaker B (NS):** Let’s meet there. I’ll text you the address and we can meet in front of the restaurant.

**Speaker A (NS):** Sounds like a plan. I’m really looking forward to it. Thanks for helping plan this evening out!

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem! It’s gonna be a lot of fun. Let’s touch base again to confirm the details, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, I’ll shoot you a text later this week. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! See you this weekend!
