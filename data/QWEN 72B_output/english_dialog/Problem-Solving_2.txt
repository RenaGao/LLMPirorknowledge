**Speaker A (NS):** Hey Jordan, thanks for coming in today. I really appreciate your understanding.

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem, Alex. What’s up? Everything okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Actually, I need to apologize for a mistake we made on your last order. We accidentally sent you the wrong item.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, really? That’s a bummer. What exactly happened?

**Speaker A (NS):** It was a mix-up in the warehouse. We packed the wrong box and it slipped through our quality control checks.

**Speaker B (NS):** I see. That’s not ideal, but mistakes happen. What are you planning to do about it?

**Speaker A (NS):** First, we’re going to send you the correct item right away, and we’ll cover the shipping costs. We’ll also include a 10% discount on your next purchase as a gesture of goodwill.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s fair enough. I appreciate the quick response. When can I expect the new item?

**Speaker A (NS):** We’ll have it shipped out today, so it should arrive within the next three to five business days.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good. I’m glad you’re handling it so smoothly.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, Jordan. We really value your business and want to make sure you’re satisfied. Is there anything else I can do to help?

**Speaker B (NS):** I think you’ve covered it. Just make sure it doesn’t happen again, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, we’re taking steps to ensure it won’t. Thanks for your feedback. It’s really important to us.

**Speaker B (NS):** No worries. I’ll keep an eye out for the new item. Thanks for sorting this out.

**Speaker A (NS):** You’re welcome. If you have any more issues or questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a great day, Jordan!

**Speaker B (NS):** Will do. Take care, Alex. Bye!

**Speaker A (NS):** Bye-bye!
