**Speaker A (NS):** Excuse me, I’m new in town and I’m trying to find the Greenview Hotel. Could you tell me how to get there?

**Speaker B (NS):** Of course! It’s pretty easy to find. Are you walking or driving?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m walking. I left my car at the station.

**Speaker B (NS):** Got it. So, you’re here on Main Street, right?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, I’m right on Main Street.

**Speaker B (NS):** Perfect. Just keep walking straight for about two blocks. You’ll see a big clock tower on your left. 

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, I see the clock tower from here. What then?

**Speaker B (NS):** Once you pass the clock tower, turn right onto Elm Street. The hotel is about a block down on your left. You can’t miss it; it’s a big white building with a green awning.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds pretty straightforward. Is it a long walk?

**Speaker B (NS):** Not at all, it’s maybe a 10-minute walk from here. It’s a nice route, too, you’ll pass a few charming shops.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s great to hear. Thanks for the detailed directions. I really appreciate it.

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem at all! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. Enjoy your stay in town!

**Speaker A (NS):** I will. Thanks again. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! Take care and goodbye!
