**Speaker A (Student):** Hey, Ms. Thompson! Do you have a minute? I wanted to ask you about the assignment due next week.

**Speaker B (Teacher):** Of course, come on in! What do you need help with?

**Speaker A (Student):** Thanks! I’m a bit confused about the research paper. The prompt says we need to use “primary sources,” but I’m not sure what exactly that means.

**Speaker B (Teacher):** That’s a great question. Primary sources are original documents or physical objects created during the time under study. For example, if you’re writing about the Civil War, primary sources could be letters, diaries, photographs, or even newspapers from that era.

**Speaker A (Student):** Oh, I see. So, like, if I were writing about the Industrial Revolution, I could use factory records or firsthand accounts from workers?

**Speaker B (Teacher):** Exactly! Those would be perfect examples of primary sources. They give you direct access to the information and experiences of the time.

**Speaker A (Student):** Got it. And what about secondary sources? How do they differ?

**Speaker B (Teacher):** Secondary sources are one step removed from primary sources. They interpret, analyze, or summarize primary sources. So, books, articles, and documentaries that discuss the Industrial Revolution would be secondary sources.

**Speaker B (Teacher):** It’s important to use a mix of both to support your arguments and provide a well-rounded perspective.

**Speaker A (Student):** That makes sense. So, if I’m引用错了,应该是:So, if I’m researching the effects of the Industrial Revolution on workers, I could use factory records as primary sources and a historian’s book analyzing those records as a secondary source?

**Speaker B (Teacher):** You’ve got it! That’s a great example. Using both types of sources will strengthen your paper and provide a more comprehensive analysis.

**Speaker A (Student):** Thanks so much, Ms. Thompson. This really clears things up for me.

**Speaker B (Teacher):** I’m glad to hear that. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, just let me know. I’m here to help!

**Speaker A (Student):** Will do. I appreciate your time. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (Teacher):** You too! Good luck with your paper, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything else. See you in class!
