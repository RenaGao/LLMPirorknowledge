**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, this handcrafted vase is beautiful! I was wondering if you could tell me more about it.

**Speaker B (NS):** Of course! This vase is made by local artisans using traditional techniques. It’s one of a kind and perfect for any home.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really impressive. I love the design and the craftsmanship. How much are you asking for it?

**Speaker B (NS):** The price is usually $50, but I can see you really like it. What do you think would be a fair price?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I was thinking more along the lines of $35. I’m a big fan of supporting local artists, and I’d love to take this home.

**Speaker B (NS):** $35 is a bit lower than what I usually go for, but I can appreciate your support. How about we meet in the middle at $42?

**Speaker A (NS):** $42 is closer to what I was thinking, but could you do $40? That would make it a perfect fit for my budget.

**Speaker B (NS):** I can do $40 for you, but let’s also throw in a small matching bowl for $5 more. That way, you get a little extra for your support.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great offer! I’ll take the vase and the bowl for $45. Thanks so much for the deal!

**Speaker B (NS):** You’re very welcome! I’m glad we could work something out. I’m sure you’ll love them both.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! Thanks again. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! Enjoy your new treasures. Take care!
