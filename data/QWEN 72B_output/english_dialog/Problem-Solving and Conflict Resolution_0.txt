**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie, thanks for agreeing to meet up today. I wanted to talk about what happened the other day.

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, of course. I’ve been thinking about it too. What’s been on your mind?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I was a bit taken aback by the way things went down. I felt like maybe you were upset with me, but I wasn’t sure why.

**Speaker B (NS):** I can see why you might have felt that way. I didn’t mean to come off as angry or anything. I was just having a rough day.

**Speaker A (NS):** I totally get that. But it felt like it was more than just a bad day. You seemed really distant, and I couldn’t help but wonder if it was something I did.

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m really sorry if it came across that way. I’ve been dealing with a lot of stress at work, and I didn’t handle it well. I should have been more transparent with you.

**Speaker A (NS):** I appreciate you being honest with me now. It’s just tough when we don’t communicate, you know? I care about our friendship, and I don’t want misunderstandings to build up.

**Speaker B (NS):** I feel the same way. I’ve been kicking myself for not being more open. I promise I’ll do better in the future. How about we both try to be more upfront with each other?

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a plan. I think it’s important to talk things out, especially when we’re feeling off. It’s a relief to clear the air.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely. I’m really glad we had this conversation. It’s nice to be on the same page again.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. So, what do you say we grab a coffee or something? Maybe we can catch up more and just enjoy each other’s company.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds perfect. I could definitely use a coffee. Thanks for bringing this up, by the way. It really means a lot.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all. I’m glad we sorted it out. Let’s head over to that new café down the street. I’ve heard great things about it.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good to me. Let’s go. Have a great time and let’s keep the lines of communication open, okay?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely. Thanks, Jamie. See you soon!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too—take care and talk soon!
