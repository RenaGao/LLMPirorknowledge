**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, I just got here and I’m trying to find the old clock tower. Do you know how to get there?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, sure! The clock tower is a pretty iconic spot around here. Are you starting from the main square?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I’m at the main square right now. What’s the best way to get there?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, from the main square, you’ll want to head down Elm Street. It’s the road right next to the fountain.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, and how far down Elm Street should I go?

**Speaker B (NS):** Go down Elm Street for about two blocks, and you’ll see a small park on your left. Take a right at the park.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. And then what?

**Speaker B (NS):** After you turn right, you’ll be on Maple Avenue. Follow Maple for one block, and the clock tower will be on your right, at the corner of Maple and Oak.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds pretty straightforward. Is the clock tower hard to miss once I’m on Maple Avenue?

**Speaker B (NS):** Not at all! It’s a big, old clock tower with a giant clock face. You’ll see it from a block away, trust me.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect, thanks a lot! Do you know if there’s a nice place to grab a coffee nearby?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, there’s a great little café called Bean There, Do That, just a block past the clock tower on Oak Street. It’s a cozy spot with really good coffee.

**Speaker A (NS):** Awesome, I’ll definitely check it out. Thanks for the help!

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem at all! Enjoy your visit. If you need any more directions, just ask around.

**Speaker A (NS):** I will. Thanks again! Have a great day!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! Take care, and enjoy the town!
