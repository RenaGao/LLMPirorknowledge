**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, can I ask you a quick question about the homework assignment?

**Speaker B (NS):** Of course, what do you need help with?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m a bit confused about the essay we’re supposed to write. The prompt mentions analyzing a character’s development, but I’m not sure if we need to focus on just one character or if we can discuss multiple characters.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s a good question. I think the prompt is a bit vague, so let’s ask the teacher for clarification tomorrow.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, that’s a good idea. Should we both go up to her after class or just one of us?

**Speaker B (NS):** Either way works. I can do it if you’re busy, or we can both go. It might be helpful to hear her response together.

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s both go. It’ll be good to have a clear understanding, and we can bounce ideas off each other too.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Do you have any specific characters in mind that you’re interested in analyzing?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking about focusing on the main character, but I also like the idea of including a secondary character to show contrast. What about you?

**Speaker B (NS):** I was thinking along similar lines. I think it could be interesting to see how the main character’s relationships with others influence their development.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great point. We could even look at how the secondary character’s development reflects or contrasts with the main character’s journey.

**Speaker B (NS):** Exactly. It could add a lot of depth to the essay. We should also check if the teacher has any specific guidelines on length or sources.

**Speaker A (NS):** Good call. I’ll jot that down so we don’t forget to ask. Thanks for the heads-up.

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem. It’s always better to be prepared. I’m looking forward to seeing what we come up with.

**Speaker A (NS):** Me too. Let’s make sure we catch the teacher after class and get those clarifications.

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely. I’ll see you then. Have a good day!

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, you too. Talk to you later!
