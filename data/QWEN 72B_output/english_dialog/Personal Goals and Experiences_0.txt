**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, it’s good to catch up! How’s everything going?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey, it’s great! Things are pretty busy but good. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here, but I’m managing. So, I was thinking, what are your goals for the next year? I’m always curious to hear what you’re planning.

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, I’ve got a few things on my plate. One of my main goals is to get back into shape. I’ve been a bit lax with my fitness routine, and I want to make a real effort to change that.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great goal. What’s your plan to make it happen?

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m thinking of joining a gym and maybe finding a workout buddy to keep me accountable. I’ve also started meal prepping to eat healthier. It’s all about creating a consistent routine, you know?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely, having a buddy can make all the difference. I’ve actually been thinking about getting more involved in my community, too. I’d like to volunteer more and be a bit more active in local initiatives.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s really admirable. What kind of volunteer work are you interested in?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve been looking into environmental projects, like tree planting and beach cleanups. I’m also thinking about joining a local community garden. I just want to do my part in making a positive impact.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s awesome. It’s so important to give back. I’ve actually been considering doing some volunteer work too, maybe in education or mentorship programs.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. Mentorship can be really fulfilling. Have you thought about where you might want to start?

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m looking into some after-school programs for underprivileged kids. I think it could be really rewarding to help them with homework and just be a positive role model.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can totally see you doing that. It’s a really meaningful goal. Any other plans for the year?

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m also hoping to travel a bit more. I’ve been saving up, and I’d love to explore some new places and maybe even learn a new language while I’m at it.

**Speaker A (NS):** Traveling is always a good idea. Where are you thinking of going?

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m eyeing Japan and Italy. The food, the culture, just everything about those places sounds amazing. What about you? Any travel plans?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m actually planning a road trip across the country. I want to see some of the national parks and just take some time to disconnect and enjoy nature.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds incredible. You’ll have to share your photos with me!

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course, I will. I’m really looking forward to it. Well, it’s been great catching up and hearing about your goals. Let’s check in on our progress later in the year.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Thanks for the chat. Take care and have a great day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Alex. Good luck with everything, and we’ll talk soon!
