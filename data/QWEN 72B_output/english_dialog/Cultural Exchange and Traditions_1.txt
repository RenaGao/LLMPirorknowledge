**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, it’s great to chat with you! I’ve always been curious about different dining etiquettes around the world. What’s the dining etiquette like in your culture?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey, thanks for asking! In my culture, we place a lot of importance on family and community during meals. We usually eat together at the table, and it’s considered rude to start eating before everyone is seated and has their food.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really interesting. In my culture, we also try to wait for everyone to be served, but it’s not always as strictly enforced. Do you have any specific rules for using utensils?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, we use both knives and forks, but we often use our right hand for eating, especially when it comes to bread and certain dishes. Using your left hand is considered impolite, as it’s traditionally used for more, um, personal hygiene tasks.

**Speaker A (NS):** Oh, I see. That’s a good point. In my culture, we use both hands for utensils, and it’s generally okay to eat with your hands, especially for things like sandwiches or finger foods. But we do try to keep our elbows off the table.

**Speaker B (NS):** Elbows off the table, got it. In my culture, it’s also important to avoid making noises while eating, like slurping or smacking your lips. It’s seen as quite rude.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s definitely a common rule in my culture too. We also try to cover our mouths when we yawn or cough. Have you ever noticed any unique customs around drinking or toasting?

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely. In my culture, toasting is a big deal. We always make eye contact when toasting, and it’s common to raise your glass and say a few words before drinking. It’s a sign of respect and camaraderie.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really nice. In my culture, we also make eye contact and might say something like "cheers" or "salud." But it’s not as formal, and we don’t always have a little speech. Do you have any specific rules for leaving the table?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yes, it’s considered polite to wait until everyone is finished eating before leaving the table. If you need to leave early, you should excuse yourself and explain why. And it’s always a good idea to thank the host for the meal.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s similar to my culture, but we’re a bit more relaxed about it. We usually wait for the host to signal when it’s okay to leave, but it’s not a hard and fast rule.

**Speaker B (NS):** It’s interesting to see how similar some of these rules are, even though the specifics can vary. What about using napkins? Do you have any etiquette around that?

**Speaker A (NS):** We usually place the napkin on our lap when we sit down and leave it on the table when we’re done eating. It’s not a big deal if you use it to wipe your mouth, but we try to be discreet.

**Speaker B (NS):** In my culture, we do the same with napkins. We also make sure to fold them neatly when we’re finished, as it’s seen as a sign of respect for the host.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a nice touch. It’s fascinating how much we can learn from each other’s dining customs. Thanks for sharing all this, it’s been really insightful.

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks for bringing it up! It’s always fun to compare and learn about different traditions. It was great chatting with you.

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Let’s catch up again soon and maybe explore more cultural differences. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too! Take care and goodbye!
