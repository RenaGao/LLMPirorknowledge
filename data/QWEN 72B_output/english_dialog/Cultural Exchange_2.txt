**Speaker A:** Hey, Sarah! Thanks for joining me today. How are you?

**Speaker B:** Hi, Mike! I’m doing well, thanks. How about you?

**Speaker A:** I’m good, thanks. I was actually hoping to chat with you about your favorite holiday in your country. I’ve always been curious to learn more about it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that sounds great! Well, my favorite holiday is definitely Thanksgiving. It’s a time when we all come together and express gratitude for what we have.

**Speaker A:** That’s really nice. What do you usually do on Thanksgiving?

**Speaker B:** We usually have a big family dinner. The table is always filled with all the traditional foods like turkey, stuffing, and lots of sides. And of course, there’s always an abundance of pies for dessert.

**Speaker A:** Yum, that sounds delicious! Do you have any specific traditions that your family follows?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we do. One of our traditions is that everyone goes around the table and shares something they’re thankful for. It’s a really heartwarming moment, and it’s a great way to start the meal.

**Speaker A:** That’s a beautiful tradition. I love the idea of focusing on gratitude. How long have you been doing that?

**Speaker B:** We’ve been doing it for as long as I can remember. It’s become a really important part of the holiday for us. And we also sometimes watch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade on TV, which is a lot of fun.

**Speaker A:** Oh, the parade! That’s such a classic part of Thanksgiving. Do you have a favorite float or performer?

**Speaker B:** I’ve always loved the giant balloons, especially the one shaped like a giant Mickey Mouse. It’s just so iconic and fun to watch.

**Speaker A:** I totally agree! It’s a childhood favorite. So, what’s your favorite part of Thanksgiving besides the food and the traditions?

**Speaker B:** I think my favorite part is just spending quality time with my family. It’s a rare opportunity for everyone to be in the same place, and it’s so nice to catch up and share stories.

**Speaker A:** That’s amazing. It really is about the people you’re with, isn’t it? Thanks for sharing all of this with me, Sarah. It’s been really interesting to hear about your traditions.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, I’m glad you found it interesting! It’s always fun to talk about holidays and traditions. Thanks for asking, Mike.

**Speaker A:** No problem at all. Let’s plan to catch up again soon and maybe even try making some of those traditional dishes together.

**Speaker B:** That sounds like a great idea! I’d love that. Have a great day, Mike!

**Speaker A:** You too, Sarah. Take care and bye for now!

**Speaker B:** Bye!
