**Speaker A (NS):** Hey there! Nice to meet you. I’m Jamie. What brings you to this event?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hi Jamie, I’m Sam. I’m just here to explore some new hobbies and meet some like-minded people. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Same here! I love trying out new things. What kind of hobbies are you into right now?

**Speaker B (NS):** I’ve been really into hiking and photography lately. There’s something about being out in nature and capturing moments that really speaks to me.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome! I’m a bit of a nature enthusiast too. Do you have any favorite spots you like to go hiking?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, there’s this one trail near my place that has the most incredible views. It’s a bit of a hidden gem. What about you? Any favorite spots?

**Speaker A (NS):** I love the state park just a few miles from here. It’s got some beautiful waterfalls and really diverse wildlife. I’ve been meaning to take my camera there more often.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds amazing! Have you done any other kinds of photography, like street photography or portraits?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve dabbled a bit in street photography. It’s a bit more challenging but rewarding. I find it really helps you observe the world in a different way.

**Speaker B (NS):** I can see why. I’ve always wanted to try it but never had the courage. Maybe we could go on a photo walk together sometime?

**Speaker A (NS):** That would be great! It’s always more fun with a buddy. What other hobbies do you have?

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m also into cooking. I love experimenting with new recipes and trying out different cuisines. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Cooking is one of my favorites too! I’ve been trying to perfect my homemade pizza lately. It’s a work in progress, but it’s been a lot of fun.

**Speaker B (NS):** Homemade pizza sounds delicious! You have to give me the recipe sometime. Maybe we can have a cooking night together?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! That sounds like a plan. It’s always more enjoyable when you can share good food and company.

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m looking forward to it. Thanks for chatting with me, Jamie. It was great meeting you.

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Sam. Let’s keep in touch and plan that photo walk and cooking night soon. Have a great day!

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds perfect. Take care and talk to you soon! Bye!
