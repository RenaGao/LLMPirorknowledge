**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Tom! How are you doing? It’s been ages since we last talked.

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey, Sarah! I’m doing pretty well, thanks for asking. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good, just keeping busy with work and all. How’s the family?

**Speaker B (NS):** Everyone’s doing great. My kids are almost back to school, so it’s been a bit chaotic around here, but in a good way. How about your kids?

**Speaker A (NS):** They’re doing well, too. My youngest just started middle school, so that’s been an adjustment.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s a big step! I remember when mine went through that. It’s a whole new world for them, isn’t it?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. They’re both growing up so fast. So, what have you been up to? Any exciting projects or trips?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, I’ve been working on this new garden project. We’re trying to make it more sustainable with native plants and a rainwater harvesting system.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds amazing! I’d love to see it sometime. Have you had much success with it?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, it’s coming along nicely. We’ve already seen a difference in the water bills, and the local wildlife seems to appreciate it, too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s fantastic. You know, we’ve been thinking about doing something similar in our backyard. Any tips?

**Speaker B (NS):** Sure! Start small and research the native plants in your area. It really helps to create a balanced ecosystem. And don’t forget about mulching to help retain moisture.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great advice, thanks. I’ll definitely look into it. Have you had any good trips lately?

**Speaker B (NS):** Not recently, but we’re planning a road trip to the Grand Canyon next year. We’re all really excited about that.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds like a fantastic trip! You’ll have to send me some pictures. We’ve been talking about going there as a family, too.

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely, I’ll make sure to capture some good moments. It’s such a breathtaking place.

**Speaker A (NS):** I can’t wait to hear all about it. Well, it’s been great catching up with you, Tom. We should do this more often.

**Speaker B (NS):** Agreed, Sarah. Let’s make a point to stay in touch more. You take care and have a great day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You, too, Tom. Talk to you soon! Bye!
