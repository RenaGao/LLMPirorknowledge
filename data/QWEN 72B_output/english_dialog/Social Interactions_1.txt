**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jordan! Have you got a minute to chat? I have an idea for Rob’s birthday.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sure, what’s up? I’ve been thinking about it too. Got any good ideas?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could plan a surprise party for him. He’s been super stressed lately, and I think it would cheer him up.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds perfect! Do you have a specific date in mind?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about next Saturday? It’s his actual birthday, so it would be a nice touch.

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, that works. Where should we do it? His place, or somewhere else?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking about renting a small event space downtown. It’s more private, and we can decorate it however we want.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s a great idea. We could also hire a caterer to take care of the food.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And we could have a DJ or a playlist to keep the energy up. What do you think about a theme? Maybe something fun like a ’90s night?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, I love that! We could all dress up in our old clothes and play some classic games.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes! We could even make a photo booth with props and backdrops. It would be a blast.

**Speaker B (NS):** Totally! Who else should we invite? Should we keep it small or go all out?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s keep it to close friends and family. Maybe around 20 people. That way, it’s more intimate and everyone can chat.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good. We should also get some decorations and balloons. Do you want to handle the invites?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I’ll send out digital invites and make sure everyone knows to keep it a secret. Can you take care of the food and drinks?

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely, no problem. I’ll start looking into caterers and DJ options today.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect! Let’s touch base mid-week to go over the details. Thanks, Jordan!

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem at all. I’m excited! Talk to you soon. Have a great day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Jordan. See you later!
