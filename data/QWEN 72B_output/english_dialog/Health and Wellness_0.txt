**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, thanks for coming in today. How have you been feeling lately?

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks for having me. I’ve been a bit off, to be honest. I’ve had this nagging headache for a few days now.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m sorry to hear that. Can you describe the headache for me? Is it a dull ache or more of a sharp pain?

**Speaker B (NS):** It’s more of a dull ache, but it’s constant. It’s been bothering me throughout the day.

**Speaker A (NS):** Got it. Is there any specific area where you feel the pain, like the front, back, or sides of your head?

**Speaker B (NS):** It’s mostly in the front, right above my forehead. And it kind of radiates down to my temples sometimes.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms? Like sensitivity to light or nausea?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yeah, I’ve been a bit more sensitive to light, and I’ve felt a little queasy a couple of times, but nothing too severe.

**Speaker A (NS):** Okay, and how’s your appetite? Have you noticed any changes in that area?

**Speaker B (NS):** My appetite’s been fine, but I do feel a bit more fatigued than usual. I’m just really tired all the time.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s helpful. Fatigue can be a symptom of a lot of different things. Have you been able to sleep well?

**Speaker B (NS):** Not really. I’ve been having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. I wake up a lot during the night.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. And have you been under any additional stress recently? Sometimes stress can manifest physically.

**Speaker B (NS):** You know, I have been pretty stressed. Work’s been hectic, and I’ve had some personal stuff going on too.

**Speaker A (NS):** That makes sense. Stress can definitely impact how you feel. I’m going to recommend some tests to rule out any underlying issues. We’ll also discuss some stress management techniques.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds good. I appreciate your help. I just want to feel better.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Thanks for coming in today, and I’ll have the nurse schedule your tests. Take care, and we’ll follow up soon.

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks, Doctor. I really appreciate it. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.

**Speaker A (NS):** You too. Take care and feel better. Goodbye!
