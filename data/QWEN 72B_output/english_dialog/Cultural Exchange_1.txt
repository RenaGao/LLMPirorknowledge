**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie! I was thinking, it’d be fun to talk about some cultural differences in dining etiquette. What do you think?

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds interesting! I’ve always been curious about how different cultures approach meals. Where do you want to start?

**Speaker A (NS):** Let’s start with something simple, like using utensils. For example, in the U.S., we often switch the fork to the right hand after cutting, but in Europe, they keep the fork in the left hand.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s true! I remember when I visited Italy, I kept forgetting to keep my fork in my left hand. It was a bit awkward at first, but everyone was really understanding.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, it’s all about adapting when you’re in a different country. How about Japan? I heard they have some specific rules about chopsticks and serving dishes.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely! In Japan, it’s considered rude to stick your chopsticks vertically into a bowl of rice, as it resembles a funeral ritual. Also, it’s polite to use the serving chopsticks to take food from communal dishes.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s really fascinating. I also learned that in India, it’s customary to eat with your right hand, and the left hand is considered unclean.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, that’s a good one! And in some Middle Eastern countries, the same rule applies. It’s all about being mindful of cultural norms.

**Speaker A (NS):** Speaking of being mindful, what about the pace of eating? In some cultures, it’s a social event and meals can last for hours, while in others, it’s more about efficiency.

**Speaker B (NS):** Exactly! In France, meals are often leisurely and can go on for a long time, with multiple courses and conversation. In contrast, in the U.S., a work lunch might be quick and to the point.

**Speaker A (NS):** Right, and in some countries like Spain, people often have a late dinner, sometimes around 9 or 10 PM. It’s all about the cultural norms and what feels natural to the people there.

**Speaker B (NS):** I love how different cultures have their own unique dining traditions. It really adds to the richness of travel and experiencing new places.

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely! It’s also a great way to learn about a culture and show respect when you’re a guest. Speaking of which, have you tried adapting to any of these customs when you travel?

**Speaker B (NS):** Definitely! When I was in Thailand, I made an effort to learn how to use a fork and spoon properly, and it made the experience so much more enjoyable.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s awesome. It’s all about embracing the local customs and making the most of the experience. Thanks for sharing all this, Jamie!

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem, it was really fun to chat about this. We should plan a dinner night and try out some of these different dining styles!

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea! Let’s do that soon. Have a great day, and thanks for the chat!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too, take care! Bye!
