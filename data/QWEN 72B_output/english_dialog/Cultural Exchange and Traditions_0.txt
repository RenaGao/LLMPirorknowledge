**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie! How’s it going?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey, Sam! I’m doing pretty well, thanks for asking. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m good, just settled in for the weekend. So, I was thinking, do you have any really cool traditions or festivals from your culture that you could tell me about?

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, that’s a great question! One of my favorites is Thanksgiving. You know, the one where we give thanks and have a big feast?

**Speaker A (NS):** Ah, yes! I’ve heard about it, but I’d love to know more. What makes it so special for you?

**Speaker B (NS):** Well, it’s not just about the food, though that’s definitely a highlight. It’s more about spending time with family and friends, reflecting on the things we’re grateful for, and just enjoying each other’s company.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds really lovely. What kind of foods do you usually have?

**Speaker B (NS):** The classic Thanksgiving meal usually includes a roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and tons of different side dishes like green bean casserole and sweet potato casserole. And of course, we can’t forget about the pumpkin pie for dessert!

**Speaker A (NS):** Wow, that sounds like a feast! Do you have any specific family traditions during Thanksgiving?

**Speaker B (NS):** Yes, we do. We always start by going around the table and sharing one thing we’re thankful for. It’s a really touching moment. Then we dig into the food, and later, we might watch some football or a parade on TV.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds so heartwarming. I love the idea of sharing what you’re thankful for. Do you have a favorite memory from a past Thanksgiving?

**Speaker B (NS):** One of my most memorable Thanksgivings was a few years ago when my grandma taught us how to make her famous apple pie. She’s an amazing cook, and it was so special to learn from her.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s such a beautiful memory. It sounds like a great way to pass down family recipes and traditions.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely! It’s all about the little moments and traditions that make it so meaningful. What about you, Sam? Do you have any traditions or festivals from your culture that you’d like to share?

**Speaker A (NS):** Sure! One of my favorites is Diwali, the Festival of Lights. It’s a Hindu festival that celebrates the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. We light up our homes with lamps and candles, exchange gifts, and have a big family dinner.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds amazing! I’ve always wanted to experience Diwali. The idea of lighting up the whole house is so festive and beautiful.

**Speaker A (NS):** It really is! It’s a time of joy and renewal. I’d love to show you some photos sometime; they capture the vibrant spirit of the festival.

**Speaker B (NS):** I’d love that, Sam. Thanks for sharing all of this with me. It’s been great learning about Diwali.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem, Jamie! Thanks for telling me about Thanksgiving. Let’s definitely plan to meet up and share more about our cultures sometime.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely, I’d love that. Have a great weekend, Sam!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Jamie! Take care and talk to you soon!
