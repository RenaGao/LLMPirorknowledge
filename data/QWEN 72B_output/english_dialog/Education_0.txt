**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie! Have you started studying for the midterm yet?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey, Sam! Not really, I’ve been procrastinating a bit. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve been trying to get a head start, but it’s tough. I feel like there’s so much to cover.

**Speaker B (NS):** I know what you mean. The syllabus is pretty dense. What are you finding the most challenging?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely the chapter on thermodynamics. The concepts are so abstract, and I’m having trouble visualizing the processes.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s tough. I’ve been struggling with the problem sets on kinetics. The equations are just so complex.

**Speaker A (NS):** Have you tried any study techniques to make it easier?

**Speaker B (NS):** I’ve been using flashcards for the formulas and doing practice problems. But it’s slow going. What about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I’ve been watching some YouTube tutorials to get a better grasp of the concepts. They’ve been really helpful.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s a good idea. I should check those out. Do you have any specific channels you recommend?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, I’ve been following “Physics Explained” and “Khan Academy.” They break things down really well.

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks, I’ll definitely look into those. We should probably start a study group. It might help to discuss the material with others.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s a great idea. I think it would be really beneficial. Want to set something up this weekend?

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good to me. Let’s shoot a group chat to the rest of our classmates and see who’s interested.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. I’ll do that later today. Thanks, Jamie.

**Speaker B (NS):** No problem, Sam. Let’s crush this exam together. Have a good one!

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, you too! Talk to you soon. Bye!
