**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sam! What are your plans for this weekend?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hey, Jamie! Not much yet. I was thinking of just hanging around the house, maybe catch up on some reading. How about you?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was actually thinking of doing something a bit more adventurous. There’s this new hike I’ve been wanting to try. Have you heard of it?

**Speaker B (NS):** No, I haven’t. Which one are you talking about?

**Speaker A (NS):** It’s called the Oakwood Trail. It’s supposed to have some really beautiful views and it’s not too challenging, so it should be a good day out.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds awesome! I’ve been wanting to get outside more. Mind if I join you?

**Speaker A (NS):** Of course not! I’d love the company. We could make a day of it. Maybe grab some lunch at that new café near the trailhead?

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s a great idea! I’ve been meaning to check it out. What time were you thinking of starting the hike?

**Speaker A (NS):** How about we meet at the trailhead around 10? That should give us plenty of time to enjoy the hike and have a leisurely lunch.

**Speaker B (NS):** Perfect! I’ll bring some snacks for the trail. Any preferences?

**Speaker A (NS):** Just some fruit and maybe some trail mix. That should keep us fueled. And don’t forget to bring plenty of water.

**Speaker B (NS):** Got it. I’ll pack a couple of water bottles. Should I bring a first aid kit just in case?

**Speaker A (NS):** Good idea. Safety first! I’ll also bring my phone in case we need to use a map or call for help.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like we’re all set. I’m really looking forward to it. Thanks for inviting me, Jamie!

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem at all, Sam! It’s going to be a great day. Let’s touch base again on Friday to confirm everything.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good to me. Talk to you then. Have a great week!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Sam. See you this weekend! Bye!
