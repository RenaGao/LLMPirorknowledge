**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Sam! Thanks for stopping by. I wanted to go over the onboarding process with you today.

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks, Jamie! I’m excited to join the team. Can you give me an overview of what to expect?

**Speaker A (NS):** Absolutely. The first step is to get you set up with all the necessary accounts and tools. We use a mix of cloud-based software, so you’ll need to create accounts for things like Slack, Trello, and Google Workspace.

**Speaker B (NS):** Got it. That makes sense. Do I need to bring my own laptop, or will the company provide one?

**Speaker A (NS):** We’ll provide a company laptop, and IT will take care of setting it up for you. You’ll also get a company email and access to our internal knowledge base.

**Speaker B (NS):** Perfect. What’s the next step after I’m set up with everything?

**Speaker A (NS):** Once you have all your accounts and tools, we’ll have a series of orientation sessions. These will cover our company culture, mission, and the specific projects you’ll be working on. We usually have a mix of one-on-one meetings and group sessions.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good. Will I be meeting with the whole team right away?

**Speaker A (NS):** Yes, we’ll have a team meeting within your first week to introduce you and give you a chance to ask any questions. It’s a great way to get to know everyone and understand how we all work together.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s really helpful. What kind of projects will I be working on?

**Speaker A (NS):** You’ll be primarily working on our new marketing campaign. It involves a lot of content creation, social media management, and some collaboration with the design team. We’ll give you a detailed project brief and a timeline.

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds exciting. How will my performance be evaluated?

**Speaker A (NS):** We have regular check-ins and performance reviews every three months. Your direct supervisor will provide feedback and set goals for you to achieve. We also encourage open communication, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

**Speaker B (NS):** That’s great to know. It all sounds very structured and supportive.

**Speaker A (NS):** We aim to make the onboarding process as smooth as possible. If you have any other questions or need any help, just let me know. How do you feel about everything so far?

**Speaker B (NS):** I feel really good about it. I’m excited to get started and be a part of the team.

**Speaker A (NS):** I’m glad to hear that! If everything goes as planned, you’ll be up and running in no time. Thanks for coming in today, Sam.

**Speaker B (NS):** Thanks, Jamie! I’ll see you around the office soon. Have a great day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Sam. Take care and welcome to the team!
