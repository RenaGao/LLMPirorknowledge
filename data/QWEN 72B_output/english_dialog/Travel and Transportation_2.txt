**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie! I’ve been thinking about planning a group vacation, and I wanted to get your input. Have you given it any thought?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hi, Chris! Yeah, I was just talking to a few of the others last week. We’re all pretty excited about it. Any destinations come to mind?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, I was thinking maybe a beach vacation or something more adventure-focused, like a mountain retreat. What do you think?

**Speaker B (NS):** Hmm, both sound great. A beach vacation would be relaxing, but a mountain retreat could be a lot of fun too. Do you have a specific place in mind for either?

**Speaker A (NS):** For the beach, I was thinking about Hawaii or the Caribbean. For a mountain retreat, maybe the Swiss Alps or the Rockies.

**Speaker B (NS):** Wow, those are some amazing options! The Caribbean sounds like a dream, but the Swiss Alps are calling my name too. What’s the group’s opinion so far?

**Speaker A (NS):** Most people seem open to either, but a few mentioned they’d love to do something they haven’t done before. Maybe we should consider the Alps for the adventure factor?

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds like a good idea. We could do some hiking, skiing, and maybe even try out some local Swiss cuisine.

**Speaker A (NS):** Exactly! And there are plenty of cozy chalets we could stay in. How about we narrow down a specific location, like Zermatt?

**Speaker B (NS):** Zermatt sounds perfect. It’s got everything we’re looking for—scenic views, great hiking, and that iconic Matterhorn. What kind of activities are you thinking about?

**Speaker A (NS):** I was thinking we could do a mix of hiking, a gondola ride to see the views, and maybe some local wine tasting. What do you think?

**Speaker B (NS):** That sounds amazing! We could also check out some of the local spas for some relaxation after all that hiking.

**Speaker A (NS):** Great idea! I’ll start putting together a tentative itinerary and send it out to the group. What about dates? How about mid-October?

**Speaker B (NS):** Mid-October works for me. The weather should be good, and it’s not too crowded. I’ll double-check with the others to confirm.

**Speaker A (NS):** Perfect. Thanks, Jamie. This is shaping up to be a fantastic trip. Let’s touch base in a week to finalize everything.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds good, Chris. I’m looking forward to it. Thanks for getting the ball rolling. Talk to you soon!

**Speaker A (NS):** You bet! Have a great one, Jamie. Take care!

**Speaker B (NS):** You too—bye for now!
