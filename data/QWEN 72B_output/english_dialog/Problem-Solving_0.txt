**Speaker A (NS):** Hey, Jamie, thanks for meeting me today. I really needed to talk this over with someone.

**Speaker B (NS):** Of course, Taylor. What’s up? You sounded pretty serious on the phone.

**Speaker A (NS):** Yeah, it’s about our last hangout. I felt like things got a bit tense, and I think there might have been a misunderstanding.

**Speaker B (NS):** Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. I didn’t realize anything was off. What exactly happened?

**Speaker A (NS):** Well, when we were talking about our plans for the summer, I mentioned how much I was looking forward to the trip to the lakes, and you kind of brushed it off, saying you weren’t sure if you wanted to go.

**Speaker B (NS):** Hmm, I didn’t mean to come across that way. I was just feeling a bit overwhelmed with work and family stuff. It’s been a hectic week.

**Speaker A (NS):** I see. I just felt like maybe you weren’t as excited about the trip as I am, and it really got to me.

**Speaker B (NS):** I’m really sorry, Taylor. I should have been more clear. I am excited, it’s just been a tough time. I promise, once things settle down, I’ll be all in.

**Speaker A (NS):** That’s good to hear. I guess I just needed to know that you were still on board. It’s important to me that we’re both excited about it.

**Speaker B (NS):** Absolutely, I get it. Communication is key, and I’ll make sure to be more transparent. I value our friendship too much to let a little stress come between us.

**Speaker A (NS):** Thanks, Jamie. It means a lot to me. I’m glad we had this chat.

**Speaker B (NS):** Me too. So, are we good to start planning again?

**Speaker A (NS):** Definitely! Let’s pick a date and start hashing out the details.

**Speaker B (NS):** Sounds like a plan. Thanks for bringing this up, Taylor. It’s important to clear the air.

**Speaker A (NS):** No problem. I’m looking forward to our trip now. Thanks for understanding.

**Speaker B (NS):** Of course, anytime. Let’s catch up soon and get everything sorted out. Have a great day!

**Speaker A (NS):** You too, Jamie. Talk to you soon. Bye!

**Speaker B (NS):** Bye, Taylor! Take care!
