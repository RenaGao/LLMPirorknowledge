Oh, yes, of course. What is the matter?
No, no, not at all! I just... um, was busy with my studies and family things. Sorry if I make you feel this way.
No, no, you are always kind. I... uh, I was thinking you might be upset with me.
Because, um, last time we meet, you seem... how to say... not happy. Maybe I talk too much about my problems.
Ah, I see. I was worried I make you... uh, bored or something.
Yes, of course! I feel much better now. Thank you for talking about this.
Yes, it is. I’m glad we talk.
That sounds nice. Yes, let’s do it!
Okay, I will wait for your message. Thank you again for understanding.
Yes, talk soon. Goodbye!
