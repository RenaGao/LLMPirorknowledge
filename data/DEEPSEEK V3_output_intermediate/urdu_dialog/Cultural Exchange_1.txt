Ah, yes, thank you! It is... um, very different from my country. In Pakistan, we eat with hands mostly. Here, I see people use fork and knife always. It is... how to say... new for me.
Yes, I am trying. But sometimes, I feel... um, not natural. Also, in my home, we share food from one plate. Here, everyone has own plate. It is different but okay.
No, no. In Pakistan, we eat dinner late. Sometimes 9 or 10 pm. Here, people eat early, like 6 or 7. I feel hungry again before sleep!
Ah, yes! In Pakistan, lunch is heavy meal. Dinner is light. Here, dinner is big. It is... um... opposite.
Yes, I try pizza and pasta. It is good, but... I miss my biryani and kebabs. Maybe one day I cook for you?
Okay, yes! I will cook and show you... um... how we eat in Pakistan. You will like it, I think.
Thank you also. It is nice to talk about my culture. I feel... more comfortable now.
Yes, take care! See you next time. Goodbye!
