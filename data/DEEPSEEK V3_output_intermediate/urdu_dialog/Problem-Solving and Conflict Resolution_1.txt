Yes, my internet is... not working. It is very slow. I try to... um, how to say, refresh, but nothing happen.
Since... yesterday night. I need internet for my work, so it is big problem.
Ah, yes, I try. I turn off and on, but still same problem.
I think yes... um, I check now. *[pauses]* One cable is... loose. I fix it... but internet still slow.
Yes, I pay last week. No problem with... bill.
Oh, okay. How long it will take?
Thank you. I hope it will be solved soon.
No, I think that is all. Thank you for your... help.
Yes, I... appreciate it. Have a good day.
Okay, goodbye!
