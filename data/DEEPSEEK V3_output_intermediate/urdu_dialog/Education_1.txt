Oh, yes, I try my best. Which problem is giving you trouble?
Ah, integration. It is... um, like finding area under curve, right?
Okay, first, you need to find function. Then, you apply rules. Um, like... product rule or chain rule.
Oh, yes, my mistake. I mean... substitution rule. For integration.
Yes, you take one part, make it... um, simpler. Then integrate it step by step.
Sure. Let’s take ∫x2 dx. First, you increase power by one, then divide by new power. So, it becomes (x3)/3.
Constant... uh, it stays same. You just multiply it with result.
You’re welcome. If you have more questions, I am here to help.
No problem. Good luck with your study, and see you in class tomorrow!
