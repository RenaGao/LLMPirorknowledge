I am good, thank you. And you?
Yes, I... um, finish my English course last month. It was very hard but I feel happy now.
I study for six month. Many times I think I cannot do it, but I... keep trying.
I want to speak better English for my job. For, uh, how to say... better communication. It is important for me.
I feel... um, proud. Also, more confidence when I talk in English. But sometimes I make mistake.
I want to learn more. Maybe I take another course for... um, business English. It will help for my work.
Thank you. Your words make me feel more... um, motivated.
Yes, it teach me that hard work bring success. I am happy I did not give up.
Thank you so much. I will try my best.
Okay, we will meet again. Thank you for talking with me.
You also have good day. Bye!
