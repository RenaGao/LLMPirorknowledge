Yes, yes, I have time. Please, tell me what is... um, deadline for this?
Ah, I start already. But I have some... problem. How to say... some tasks are difficult for me.
Um, the report writing. I am not good in English, so it is taking... much time.
Outline? Um, yes, I make structure. I will send it to you?
Data analysis is... okay. I finish half. But I need more time for conclusion.
Thank you so much! You are very kind.
Um, no, I think everything is okay now. I will send you outline today.
Yes, Thursday is okay. I will be ready then.
Thank you for helping me. I am... um, very happy to work with you.
Yes, see you Thursday. We will finish it together!
