Oh, thank you. Yes, I am ready to learn. What is the... um, work for today?
Ah, feedback forms. Yes, but I don’t know... how to say... steps for doing?
Yes, positive, negative, neutral. I understand. Then?
Oh, counting. Yes, I can do. But if I don’t understand some words, what I do?
Okay, thank you. I will try my best.
One more thing. After counting, where I put the forms?
Ah, colors make easy. I will do carefully.
Thank you. I will start now.
Sure. I will.
Thank you so much! I will do my best.
