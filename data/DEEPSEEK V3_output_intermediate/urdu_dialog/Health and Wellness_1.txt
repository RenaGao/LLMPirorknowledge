Hello! I am... um, fine, but feeling little tired. Always busy with work.
Not much. I think I am, how to say, not eating good food and no exercise.
Yes, I know. But... um, I donâ€™t have time for this.
Yes, walking is good. In my city, my friend also say to walk. But I... um, I feel lazy.
Okay, I will try. First, I will eat fruits. Like apple and orange.
Yes, water is important. I forget to drink it, but now I will remember.
Ah, yes. I sleep late because of work. But I will try to sleep early.
Thank you for advice. I will follow it.
Yes, I will tell you. Okay, I must go now. See you later!
Goodbye! Stay healthy too!
