Ah, yes! I think... um, maybe mountains? Like, you know, place with snow and, um... how to say... fresh air?
We can do skiing, and also... um, walking? Like, small walk in snow with view.
Yes, yes! Snowshoeing. And also, we can make... um, snowman? For fun?
I hear about... um, Switzerland? It is very beautiful, and many people go there for snow.
Maybe... um, one week? So we can enjoy all activity without hurry.
I think... um, small house in mountain? Like, with fireplace and... um, big window for view?
Yes, chalet! It feel like home, but in mountain.
Yes, we can check... um, websites for chalet and flight. Maybe December? For snow?
Okay! I am very excited. This is... um, how to say... good plan.
Okay, thank you! I think this vacation will be... um, very happy time for all.
Yes, talk soon. Goodbye for now!
