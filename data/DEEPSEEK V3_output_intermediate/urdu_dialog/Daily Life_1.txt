Hello! I am fine, thank you. How are you?
Yes, I want to make picnic with my family. But I have some... um, how to say... confusion.
I not sure where is good place for picnic. Maybe park, but also I think about... um, near river.
Quiet, yes. My family like quiet place, with trees and... uh, open space.
Yes, that is good idea. But what we take for food? I want to make it special.
Ah, yes! My mom make biryani very well. And maybe some... um, fried things? Like samosas.
Oh, yes. My brother like chips. And we can take... uh, cold drinks.
I think... it good to take ball for playing. And maybe cards game. We like to play cards.
I hope so. Thank you for helping me. Now I feel more... um, confident about planning.
Thank you! Now I go to make list for picnic. Goodbye!
