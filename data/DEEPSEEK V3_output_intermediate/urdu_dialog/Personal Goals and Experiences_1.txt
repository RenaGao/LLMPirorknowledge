Ah, yes. I want to learn... um, how to say... the skill for making food, like professional.
Yes, cooking. I like to eat good food, but... um, I not know to make it.
Because... um, in my culture, food is very important. When I can cook, I can make food for my family and friends. It is like... showing love.
Yes, I want to learn to make... um, traditional food from my country. Like biryani.
I think... um, I not have time. And maybe... I feel it is difficult.

My mother is very good cook. She can teach me, but... um, she live far.
