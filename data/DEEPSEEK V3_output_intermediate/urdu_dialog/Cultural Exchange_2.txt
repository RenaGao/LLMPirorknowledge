Ah, yes, my favorite holiday is... Eid. Eid-ul-Fitr. It is very important in our culture.
We wear new clothes, go to mosque for prayer, and then... um, how to say... we visit family and friends. Also, we eat special food, like biryani and sweets.
Yes, we give money... um, it’s called *Eidi*. Mostly, elders give to children. It is like... a blessing.
It is very happy time because... um, after fasting in Ramadan, we celebrate. Everyone is together, and people also help poor and needy. It is... how to say... a time of joy and sharing.
Yes, we clean house and put lights, and sometimes... um, decorate with colorful things. It looks very nice.
Oh, you must visit bazaars and see the... um, traditional clothes and food. Also, people are very friendly, so you will feel welcome.
You’re welcome. It was nice talking about Eid. Maybe one day you will come to Pakistan?
Thank you, you too. Bye!
