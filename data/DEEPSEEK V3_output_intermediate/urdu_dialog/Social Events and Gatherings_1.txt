Ah, yes! I think we... um, we should make it in her flat. Her flat is big and nice.
Maybe only close friends? She like small group, I think.
Um, I think order food is better. Like... pizza or biryani? Sara love biryani.
Yes, yes! Cake is good. Maybe chocolate... or, how to say, mango? She like mango cake.
Um, maybe 7 oâ€™clock? Sara finish work at 6, so she come... come home at 7.
Yes, yes! Balloons and... um, lights? Colourful lights?
Okay, I will do it. I send message to all friends.
Um... maybe music? Sara like... uh, old songs.
Good idea. I think she will be very happy.
Yes, okay. Tomorrow, same time, we meet. Thank you for your help!
See you tomorrow! Goodbye!
