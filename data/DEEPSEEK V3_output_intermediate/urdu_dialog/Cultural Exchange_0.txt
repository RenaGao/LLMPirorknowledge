Yes, of course! One big festival is Eid-ul-Fitr. It comes after Ramadan, the month of fasting.
On Eid, we start with special namaz, um... prayer. Then, we wear new clothes and go to meet family and friends.
Yes! We make sweets like... um... sewaiyan, it is like vermicelli with milk and sugar. Also, we give money to children, called "Eidi."
Yes, it is gift, but usually cash. Children are very happy for it.
Yes, some people decorate with lights and, um... colorful things. But mostly, we focus on food and family.
Yes, it is thanks to Allah for giving us strength during Ramadan. Also, it is time for forgiveness and... um... being kind to others.
You are welcome. Iâ€™m happy to tell you about Eid.
Yes, you must come! You will like it very much.
Thank you for listening. Goodbye!
