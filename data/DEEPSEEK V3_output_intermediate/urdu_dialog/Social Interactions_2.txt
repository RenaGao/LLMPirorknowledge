Hello! Yes, it is... um, very long time. I am fine, thank you. How are you?
Everything is good. Uh, my family is fine. But... how to say... work is very busy now.
Yes, same place. But now I have more... um, responsibility. It is little difficult.
Oh, my son? He is very good. He started school now. He is... um, learning ABC and... numbers?
Yes, I try. But sometimes I... um, how to say... forget English words. It is... funny.
Yes, yes! He learn very fast. I am happy.
Yes, I like this idea. Um, maybe next month? I can visit you.
Okay, I will... um, message you later. We can decide.
Thank you! I will. You also take care. Goodbye for now.
Yes, me too. Goodbye!
