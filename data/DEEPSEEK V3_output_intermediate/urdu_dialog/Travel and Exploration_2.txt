Oh, yes, thank you. I am trying to find... um, the big clock tower. How to say... the famous one?
Yes, Town Clock Tower. I hear it is very nice. But I don’t know how to go there.
Yes, I am here on Main Street. I walk from... um, the bus station.
Bookstore... yes, I see. Go straight, left at bookstore. Then?
Park on right, then tower. Okay, I understand. Thank you so much!
No, no, it’s fine. I will try. If I am lost again, I will ask someone.
Yes, I am excited. Thank you again for your help!
Thank you, you too! Goodbye!
