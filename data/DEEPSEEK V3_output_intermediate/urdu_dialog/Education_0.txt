Hello! Ah, yes, preparation... it is, um, going okay. But I feel little nervous.
I focus on, uh, mathematics and science. Science is... difficult for me.
Yes, um, biology... the thing about cells and... how to say... their work?
Yes, yes! Cell functions. I read book, but not understand everything.
That will be very helpful, thank you. What time you are free?
Yes, 3 PM is good. I will come to library.
Ah, yes. For mathematics, the... um, thing with shapes and angles...
Yes, geometry. I find it... complicated.
Thank you so much. You are very kind.
Yes, I agree. Studying alone is... boring.
Yes, see you tomorrow at library. Thank you again!
Thank you. I will try my best. Goodbye!
