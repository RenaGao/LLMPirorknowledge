Hello! Ah, yes, the test. I am... um, not fully ready yet. I have some problem with... how to say... the part of physics.
Yes, mechanics. It is very... um, difficult for me. Equations, you know?
I try, but sometimes I cannot understand the... uh, process. Maybe I need more practice.
That is very good idea! I think it will help me. When you are free?
Yes, okay. Tomorrow afternoon is fine. I will come to library after lunch.
Maybe... chemistry also. The formula for, um... reactions. I forget them sometimes.
Okay, I will bring everything. Thank you for helping me.
Yes, I will try. I feel more... um, confident now.
Thank you! See you tomorrow. We will study together and do well in test.
You too! Bye!
Thank you, I will do my best. See you tomorrow!
You too. Bye!
