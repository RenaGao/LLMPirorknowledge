Hello! Ah, I like... um, how to say, a movie with action and emotion. I think it is called... *Dangal*. You know it?
Yes, yes! It is story of father who train his daughters for... um, sport wrestling. Very inspiring.
Yes, I watch TV shows. My favorite is... um, *Friends*. It is comedy, very funny.
I like Ross. He is... how to say... very smart, but sometimes too much funny.
Yes, I watch some. *Zindagi Gulzar Hai* is one I like. It is about family and... um, life problems.
Hmm, I like both. But dramas make me think more. Comedy is for relax.
Yes, I like Mahira Khan. She is... um, very good actress. Her acting feels real.
Yes, but sometimes I need, um, subtitle. It helps me understand better.
Ah, I like *The Pursuit of Happyness*. It is very... um, motivational.
Yes, thank you! I enjoy this talk. Maybe we can watch a movie together someday.
Thank you, you too. Goodbye!
