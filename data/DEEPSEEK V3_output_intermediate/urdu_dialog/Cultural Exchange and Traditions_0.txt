Yes, sure! In my country, we have... um, Eid. It is very big festival. We celebrate after Ramadan.
We wake up early, wear new clothes, and go mosque for special prayer. After that, we meet family and eat... um, how to say... delicious food.
We have biryani, kebabs, and sweet... um, what is word? Sweet... like milk and sugar...
Yes, yes! Sheer khurma. It is very traditional for Eid.
Yes, we give Eidi. It is... um, money given to children and young people. They feel very happy.
Yes, we visit everyone. We say "Eid Mubarak" and share sweets and... um, how to say... happiness.
It is for three days, but first day is most important. Everyone is very excited for it.
You are welcome. Maybe one day you can come and see it. You will like it, I think.
Yes, sure. Thank you for listening. Okay, I will see you later!
You too! Goodbye!
