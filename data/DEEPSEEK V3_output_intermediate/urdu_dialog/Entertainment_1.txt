Ah, yes! I think we can go to... um, restaurant. Or maybe some activity. What you prefer?
I like Indian food, but also... um, how to say... place with many foods?
Yes, buffet! I like buffet because I can try many things.
Um, there is one called... um, “Spice & Taste.” It is near market. I go there one time, food is... how to say... very tasty.
Yes, maybe we can go to... um, place where we watch movie?
Yes, cinema! Or... um, another idea is bowling. I never try it, but it seems fun.
Yes, I would like to try. So, first we eat at buffet, then go for bowling. Good plan?
Um, maybe 6:30 at restaurant? Then we have enough time for bowling.
Yes, booking is good idea. Sometimes it is full, especially Friday.
Me too! Thank you for planning. I think it will be... um, very enjoyable evening.
Okay, I will wait for message. See you on Friday!
Thank you, you also. Bye!
