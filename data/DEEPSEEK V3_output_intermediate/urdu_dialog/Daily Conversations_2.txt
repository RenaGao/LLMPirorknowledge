Hello! I am fine, thank you. How are you?
Ah, yes! Last week, I went to... um, how to say... big party for my friend’s wedding.
It was very nice! Everyone wear... um, wear colorful clothes, and there was so much food. I eat a lot!
I enjoy the dancing. Everyone dance together, and I also dance with my friends. It make me very happy.
It make me feel... um, excited and also... thankful? Yes, thankful because I meet many old friends.
Yes, I take many photos. I will show you later if you want.
Yes, it was... um, very memorable. I will not forget it.
No, I think that’s all. Thank you for listening to me.
You also take care. Goodbye!
