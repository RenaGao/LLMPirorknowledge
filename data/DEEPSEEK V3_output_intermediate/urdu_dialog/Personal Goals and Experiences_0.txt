Ah, hello! It is... um, good, but also busy. I have many thing to do.
Yes, yes. I want to improve my English. It is important for my job. And also, I want to... um, how to say... learn new skill?
Maybe... programming? I hear it is useful. But I not know where to start.
Um, I think... I will find course on internet. Maybe spend one hour every day? But sometimes I feel... how to say... lazy?
Ah, yes! This is good advice. I will try it. And for English, I think... um, I will read more books.
I like storybooks. And sometimes... um, articles about technology.
Yes, I think so. But I worry... will I have time for all this?
Ah, you are right. One thing at a time. This is... um, better plan.
Maybe... um, travel? I want to visit new place, but I not decide yet.
Maybe UK? I hear it is very beautiful. And I can practice English there.
Yes, but first I need to save money.
Thank you for your advice. It is very helpful.
I hope so. Thank you for talking with me.
Okay, I will. Goodbye!
