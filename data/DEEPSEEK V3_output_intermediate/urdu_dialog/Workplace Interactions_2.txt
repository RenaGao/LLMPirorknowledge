Yes, of course. I can discuss. But, um... what is... agenda? I mean, what we need to talk in meeting?
Ah, I see. So, we can talk about... um, project update first? Then, maybe... new ideas from team?
Yes, I think. My team is... um, how to say... almost finish the report. We need to... uh, check it one more time. Maybe we can discuss in meeting?
Yes, that is important. Also, maybe we can talk about... um, training for new software?
Um... no, I think that is enough. Too many thing will make meeting long.
Yes, that is very good. I will make notes and prepare for my part.
Thank you too. I will check it and tell you if I have any... uh, suggestion.
You also have a great day. See you in the meeting next week!
