Yes, of course. My favorite hobby is... um, painting. I like to make art with colors.
I think... about three year. I start in school, but now I do it in my free time.
I paint... um, nature. Like trees, flowers, and sometimes river. It makes me feel calm.
Mostly from real life. But sometimes, if no time, I use... uh, how to say... photos? Yes, photos from my phone.
Yes, I have one. It is... um, a sunset near my home. I use many colors like orange, pink, and yellow. It is my best work.
Sometimes I show to my family and friends. They like it. But I feel shy to show... um, everyone.
Maybe one day. I think about joining... art class, but I have no time now.
I enjoy... how to say... it makes me forget problems. When I paint, I feel happy and relaxed.
Thank you for listening. It is good to talk about my hobby.
Yes, inshallah. Thank you, you also have a nice day!
