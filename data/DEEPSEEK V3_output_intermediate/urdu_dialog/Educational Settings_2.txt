Oh, hi! It is... um, a bit difficult. I try to understand... uh, how to say, the topic of... um, chemistry reaction?
Yes, yes! Chemical reactions. I read about it, but still not fully clear.
The thing... uh, how the elements... um, change their form. I mean, how they become different after reaction.
Exactly! This is the point. How to explain it?
Ah, I see! So, the... um, elements mix and make new thing. Like, hydrogen and oxygen make water.
So, it is like... um, the atoms rearrange themselves?
Yes, yes! Now I can understand better. Thank you so much!
Uh, not now. I think I need some time to... um, to practice this one first.
Thank you! You explain very well. I will, um, meet you again if I have more questions.
See you later! Thank you for your help.
