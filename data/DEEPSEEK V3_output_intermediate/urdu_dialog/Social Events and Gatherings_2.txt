Hello, my name is Ali. Nice meeting you also.
Ah, I like... um, reading books and sometimes watching films.
I like, um, history and also Urdu poetry. It is very beautiful.
No, no, I donâ€™t write. But I... um, enjoy to read and understand meaning.
Yes, I like drama films. They are... uh, how to say... showing real life in Pakistan.
Oh, yes! You can watch *Khuda Kay Liye*. It is very good film.
Sometimes I play cricket. In Pakistan, it is very popular.
Not now, but I played many times in school. It was fun.
Yes, it is nice to talk with you.
Yes, of course. Thank you for nice talk, Sarah.
You also have a good day. Bye!
