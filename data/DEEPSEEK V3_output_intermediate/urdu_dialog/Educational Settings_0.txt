Yes, yes. I have confusion about the... um, task.
The part where we need to... um, write about the theme of story. I don’t understand what is "theme" exactly.
Oh, okay. So, I need to find main idea? Not the... um, summary?
Thank you, teacher. This makes more sense now. But also, how many pages we need to write?
Yes, two pages is okay. But I worry about grammar. I don’t want to make many mistake.
Thank you, teacher. You are very kind.
No, I think it’s enough. I will start to write now.
Thank you, teacher. I will try my best. Goodbye!
You also have a good day, teacher. I will work on assignment now.
