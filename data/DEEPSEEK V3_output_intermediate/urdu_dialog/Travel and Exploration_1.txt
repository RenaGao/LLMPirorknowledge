Ah, yes, my favorite place is... um, how to say... a hill station. It is called Murree.
Yes, it is in north of Pakistan. The view is very... very beautiful. You can see the snowy mountains and trees.
I like to... um, walk on Mall Road. And sometimes, I take photos. The air is clean and fresh.
Not so much now. Before, I go with my family every year. Now, I am busy with work and... um, other things.
It is special because... uh, it makes me feel peaceful. Also, I have many good memories with my family there.
Yes, it is. I hope one day I can visit again.
Yes, I will try. Thank you for asking about it.
You are welcome. It is nice to talk with you.
Sure, that would be good.
