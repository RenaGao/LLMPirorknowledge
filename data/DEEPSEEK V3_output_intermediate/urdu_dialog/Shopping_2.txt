Hello, um... I have this thing... thing I buy from here. I want to... return it.
Yes, I have it. It is... in my bag. One moment, please. *[Pause]* Here.
It is... not working. When I take home, it doesn’t do the... uh, the work it should do.
Yes, defective. It is not broken, but it doesn’t... function.
Oh, thank you. How I get the money back?
Yes, that is fine.
Okay, good. Thank you for help.
No, that is all. Thank you again. Goodbye.
