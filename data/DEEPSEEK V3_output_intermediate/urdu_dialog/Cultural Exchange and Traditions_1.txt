Ah, yes. In my culture, Pakistan, we use hands for eating many food. Like roti or rice. But it is... um, important to use only right hand. Left hand is, uh, not polite.
Yes, family eat together. We sit on floor, and food is in one big plate. All people share food from same plate. It is... um, how to say... sign of closeness.
Yes, we say “Bismillah”—means “In the name of God.” Before eating, it is respectful to say this. Also, we try to finish all food. Not waste is good.
Yes, chai is very important! After meal, we drink chai with family. Sometimes with cardamom or sugar. It is... um, how to say... relaxing time.
Uh, maybe... in my culture, it is polite to offer food again and again. Like, “Take more, take more!” Even if you say no, we insist. It is... how to say... showing care.
Yes, it is important to understand culture, I think. Also, in my home, elder people eat first. Younger must wait. It is... um, sign of respect.
You’re welcome! I also learn a lot. Maybe one day, I visit your country and try your food.
Yes, thank you! Goodbye and take care too. We will meet again, insha’Allah.
