Hello, um, I have problem with my laptop. It is not working, I think.
Yes, it... uh, the screen is black. Even when I press power button, nothing happen.
Ah, yes, it is charging. I check the charger, it is fine. But still, no screen.
Uh, okay, I try. *[pause]* No, it is not working. Still black.
External monitor? Um, no, I donâ€™t have... how to say... extra screen.
Hardware issue? So, it is... broken?
No, it is two years old. But I need it for my work. What I can do?
Yes, please. And, um, how much it will cost?
Okay, thank you. I will go there tomorrow. Thank you for your help.
You too. Goodbye!
