Yes, it is rice with... um, meat? Usually chicken. And many... how to say... masalas?
Yes, spices! Like turmeric, cumin, and garam masala. It is very tasty.
First, I... uh, take rice and boil it. Then I cook chicken with onion, garlic, and tomato. After that, I mix all the spices and... um, layer them.
Yes, layer rice, then chicken, then rice again. Last, I put some... uh, thing for color... uh, yellow.
Yes, saffron! And then I cook it on low heat for... maybe twenty minutes.
Yes, it is! And we eat it with... um, yogurt and salad.
Of course! I will teach you. It is very easy if you know the steps.

Me too. And I think our food problem is solved now!
