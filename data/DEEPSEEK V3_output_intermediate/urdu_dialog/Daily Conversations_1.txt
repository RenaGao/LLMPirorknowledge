Ah, yes! I think I will go to... um, how to say... the place where many books are?
Yes, library! I need to take some books for my study.
I want to read about history... and also maybe one storybook. I like stories very much.
Um, I donâ€™t know English authors very well, but in Urdu, I like Allama Iqbal. He writes... how to say... poems?
Sometimes I try, but my English is not so good for poems.
Maybe I will cook some food. I want to make biryani. It is very famous dish in Pakistan.
Yes, it has many spices. You should come and try it one day!
No, I think I can manage. But maybe I will borrow your... um, thing for fixing paper?
Thank you! You are very helpful.
Thank you! You too. We will talk later, okay?
Yes, take care. Bye-bye!
