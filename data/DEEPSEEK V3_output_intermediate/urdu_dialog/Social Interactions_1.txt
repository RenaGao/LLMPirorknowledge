Yes, yes! I think we must do something special. Maybe... um, a party? But how to make it surprise?
Oh, café is good! Ali always go there for coffee. But I worry, um, how to bring him there without he suspect?
Yes, that is clever. I will say... um, "Let’s meet for study." Then he will not know it is party.
Yes, Sara and Ahmed must come. They are... um, his *yaar*—his close friends.
Cake is very good. I will bring chocolate cake. Ali like chocolate very much.
Ah, yes, gift. Maybe something for his hobby? He love... um, how to say... books about history?
That is very nice. I think Ali will be very happy. He will not expect this!
Yes, I will also help. Thank you for planning with me. This will be a very good birthday for Ali.
Okay, I will talk to Sara and Ahmed too. We will make it great. Bye-bye!
Yes, together we will make it the best surprise for him. See you tomorrow!
