Ah, yes! In my country, we have... um, Mid-Autumn Festival. It is very important and family time.
It is in... um, eighth month, fifteenth day, lunar calendar. So, every year date is different.
We eat mooncake—it’s kind of, um, small round cake with sweet inside. And also, we watch moon together because it’s very big and bright.
Moon mean... uh, how to say... reunion. Family come together, like moon is full and round.
Yes, we give mooncake to friends and family. It is... um, traditional way to show love and thanks.
Ah, yes! Children play with lanterns. They make it with paper and light inside. It’s very colorful and fun.
Yes, every year. It is my favorite festival because I can see all my family and eat mooncake.
You should come! I can bring mooncake for you to try.
You are welcome! I’m happy you like it.
Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
