Hello, Alex. I am fine, thank you. My name is Li Wei. Nice to meet you.
Yes, I have some experience. I use Excel before... um, and also... Python? But not very expert.
Pivot table? Ah, yes, I think I use it once. But... um, how to say... not very sure.
Yes, I try. Highlight data, then... insert, pivot table. Okay, I think I can do it.
Drag... rows, and ratings... into values. Okay, I understand. Thank you for explain.
Okay, I will save and share. Um... if I have problem, I can ask you?
Teams? Ah, yes, I use it before. I think I can do it. If I forget, I will... um, check how to do it.
Thank you, Alex. I will try my best.
Okay, touch base tomorrow. See you then!
You too, Alex. Goodbye!
