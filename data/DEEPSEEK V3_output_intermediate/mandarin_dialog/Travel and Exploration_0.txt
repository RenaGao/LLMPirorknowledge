Ah, yes! We want to go... um, how to say... big city. Maybe New York?
We want to see famous place, like... Statue of Liberty. And also, shopping, and eat food.
Yes, but... um, it is difficult. Hotels are very expensive. Maybe we stay in... um... sharing place?
Yes! Airbnb. It is cheaper and... uh, more comfortable for group.
Transportation? Ah, yes. We think take train to New York. And in city, we use... um... subway.
We think three days. Is it enough?
Thatâ€™s good. But we are worry about... um, budget.
Yes, we will make list. Like... Statue of Liberty first, then shopping, then... um, famous museum.
Yes! That one. Thank you for help.
We think... um, next month. In October.
Yes, we hope so. Thank you for advice.
I will. Thank you! We will plan more and tell you.
Thank you! We are very excited. Bye!
