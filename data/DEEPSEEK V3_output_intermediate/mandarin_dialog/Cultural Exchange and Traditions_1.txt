Ah, yes. In China, we... um, how to say... always give food to others. It is polite. We use chopsticks, not fork.
Yes, we use chopsticks to... um... put food in other person’s bowl. But in Western style, I think it is not polite, right?
Oh, I see. And we always use common... uh, shared dish. Not everyone eat alone.
Yes, I notice this. Also, in China, if host give you more food, you must... um, accept it. It means they are very kind.
Ah, yes. In China, we also say thank you many times. And when we finish, we say... um, “thank you for the meal.”
Hmm... yes. In China, younger people always pour drink for older people. It is respect.
I understand. It is very different, but both are... um, good ways to show politeness.
Thank you too. I learn many things about Western style. I think it is... um, very helpful.
Yes, I will. Thank you for your time.
You too. Goodbye!
