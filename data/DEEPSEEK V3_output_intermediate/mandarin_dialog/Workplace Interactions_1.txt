Thank you, Sarah. Okay, I listen carefully.
Ah, collect data... from sales team. What kind of data?
Oh, I see. Numbers and... um, feedback. Okay.
Yes, I know Excel. But maybe need... some practice again.
Calculate total sales. I think I can do this.
Summary... maybe need help with words. My English writing is... not so good.
Ah, send email to manager. I can do this.
Okay, save file with name... “Sales_Report_Week1.” Got it.
Um... how to say... what if sales team not give data on time?
Remind them... politely. Okay, I understand.
Thank you, Sarah. I will try my best.
Yes, tomorrow. Thank you again, Sarah. See you!
Thank you! I will work hard.
Bye, Sarah!
