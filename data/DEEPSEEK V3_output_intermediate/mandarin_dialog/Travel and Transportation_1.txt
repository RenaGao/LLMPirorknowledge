Oh, yes, thank you. I... um, try to find hotel. Do you know where is it?
The name is... um... Sunshine Hotel?
I prefer walking. It is not too far, right?
Go straight... then turn left at second light, yes?
Oh, park! That is easy. Thank you so much!
No, no, I think I can find it now. Thank you again.
Yes, thank you! You are very kind. Goodbye!
*The conversation ends with friendly goodbyes, and the L2 speaker successfully receives directions to the hotel.*
