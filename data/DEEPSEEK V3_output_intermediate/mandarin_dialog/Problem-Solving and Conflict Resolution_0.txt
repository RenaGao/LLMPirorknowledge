Um... yes, I feel maybe you forget my... my birthday yesterday? I wait for you say "happy birthday," but you no say.
Ah, really? I think you forget because you no message me. I feel... how to say... a little sad.
Itâ€™s okay. I now know you no forget. You have present for me? What is it?
Oh! You remember that? I feel very happy now. Thank you so much.
Yes, that is good idea. But, um... where we meet?
Ah, yes, I remember. The place with good coffee. Okay, what time?
Yes, 3 p.m. is good. I will see you then.
Yes, see you tomorrow. And thank you for... um, understanding my feelings.
You too. Goodbye!
