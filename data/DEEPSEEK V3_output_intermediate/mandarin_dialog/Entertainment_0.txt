Ah, yes! I watch... um, one TV show called "Game of Thrones." It is very famous, I think.
I like the story and the... how to say... the characters. They are very strong and interesting.
No, not yet. I am on season... um, season four. The part where, um... the king dies.
Really? I am excited to see. Do you have any other... um, recommendation?
"Stranger Things"? I hear this name before. Is it... scary?
Oh, that sounds good. I will try it. Thank you for telling me.
My favorite movie is... "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." I watch it many times.
Yes, and the music, the... how to say... the feeling is very beautiful.
Do you like Chinese movies?
You can try "The Farewell." It is very... touching.
You’re welcome. It’s nice to talk about movies.
Yes, I agree. See you next time!
