Ah, yes. I am... um, working hard. But I feel a little... how to say... nervous?
For me, the writing part is difficult. I understand the question, but my words... uh, my grammar is not so good.
Yes, I try. I write two essays, but I not sure if it is correct. Maybe you can... um, check for me?
Listening is okay, but sometimes I miss the word. And speaking... um, I need more practice.
That is good idea! When you have time?
Yes, good. Tomorrow after class. I will bring my notebook.
Yes, I will. I already make list of words. But some words I... um, forget the meaning.
Thank you. You are very helpful. I feel a little better now.
Yes, we will do our best! See you tomorrow then.
Thank you, and you too! Goodbye!
