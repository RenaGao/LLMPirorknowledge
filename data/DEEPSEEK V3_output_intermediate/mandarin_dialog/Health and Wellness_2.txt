Hello, thank you. I want to... um, make my body more strong. And also, I want to lose some... how to say... extra weight.
I sometimes run in the park. And, um, I try to do... how to say... push-ups and sit-ups at home. But I donâ€™t have plan.
I have some dumbbell, but I not use them often. I think... maybe I need more instruction.
Maybe three or four day. I work many hours, so sometimes I tired.
Yes, that sound good. But, um, what is cardio?
Ah, I see. I like running, so I think I can do that.
Okay, thank you. I think this plan is very... um, useful.
Not now. I will try my best. If I have problem, I will ask you.
Okay, thank you for your help. See you next time!
