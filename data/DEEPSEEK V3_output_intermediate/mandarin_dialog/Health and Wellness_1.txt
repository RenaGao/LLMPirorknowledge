Ah, hello! I am good, but... um, I feel little tired these days.
Maybe... because I sleep late. And I eat too much... um, how to say... not healthy food.
Yes, yes! Junk food. I like it very much, but I know it is not good for health.
Yes, I think so. I want to... um... eat more vegetables and fruit. But... how to keep doing it?
Cooking at home... yes, it sounds good. But I am not very good at cooking.
Oh, good idea. I will try. And... um, I also think I need to exercise.
I think I can walk in the evening. After work, I feel... um... too much sitting.
Yes. And maybe I will drink more water. I always forget.
Ah, good idea! I will do that.
Yes, thank you for your advice. I feel more... um... confident to start.
I will! Thank you so much. Goodbye!
Okay, see you later!
