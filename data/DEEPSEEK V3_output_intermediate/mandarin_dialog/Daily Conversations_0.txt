Ah, yes! My favorite hobby is... um, how to say... taking pictures with camera.
I like to take picture of, um, nature. Like trees, flowers, and sometimes... how to say... big places, like mountains.
Yes, landscapes. I go to park or... um, countryside to take picture.
I think it is, um, good way to... how to say... keep memory. Also, it make me feel happy when I see... uh, what is the word... beautiful things.
Yes, I have one. It is... um, picture of sunset in my hometown. The sky has many colors, like red, orange, and... yellow.
I try to keep them natural. But sometimes I use, um, phone app to make colors more... clear.
Yes, I share with my friends and family. They say it is very nice. And I also put them on, um, social media.
Yes, I want to buy better camera and learn... um, more skill. Maybe travel to new places to take picture.
Thank you. I think it will be very fun.
Thank you too. I enjoy talking about my hobby. Goodbye!
