Ah, yes, I very sorry about that. My calendar... um, how to say, was not correct. I make mistake.
Yes, I talk with my colleague later. She tell me everything. But I still feel... um, bad for the mistake.
Oh, yes, that is very helpful! I think reminder will, uh, help me not forget.
No, thank you. You are very kind to help me. I will, um, be more careful next time.
Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
