Hi! Yes, I have time. My morning routine is... um... quite normal, I think.
I wake up at 6:30. But sometimes... um... when I sleep late, I wake up at 7:00.
Yes, I eat breakfast, but not right away. First, I... um... brush my teeth and wash my face.
I usually eat... um... bread and egg. And sometimes porridge. My mom say porridge is good for stomach.
Yes, I drink tea. Green tea, not coffee. I don’t like coffee... it’s too strong for me.
Sometimes I do... um... light exercise. Just stretch or walk around my house before I go to work.
No, I don’t. I prefer to... um... think about my day or just enjoy quiet time.
I leave at 8:00. My office is... um... not far from my home, so I take bus or sometimes walk.
Thank for asking! It’s nice to talk with you. I must go now, so I will say goodbye.
Thank you, you too! Goodbye!
