Ah, yes! I want to learn… um, how to say… playing the piano.
I think piano is very beautiful. When I hear the music, I feel… um, peaceful. Also, I want to make my family happy by playing for them.
Yes, I think so. Maybe I find a teacher or… um, use online class. But I don’t know if I have enough time. I have many work now.
No, not yet. I need to buy one… uh, how to say… small piano. Is called electric piano?
Oh, good idea! Maybe I buy one next month. I also think it’s good for my mind… um, like, make me more smart.
No, never. Piano is my first. I hope I can do it, but I think it will take… um, many year.
Yes, I think so. Thank you for your advice. It makes me feel more… um, confident.
Thank you so much! I will try my best. Maybe one day I can play a song for you.
Okay, I will. Thank you again. Have a nice day!
Goodbye! See you next time!
