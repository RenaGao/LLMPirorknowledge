Yes, thank you. I looking for... um, thing for making tea. You know, hot water and tea leaves.
Yes, teapot! But not so big. For one person.
Ceramic is better, I think. Glass maybe... um, too fragile.
Infuser? Ah, for keep tea leaves inside?
This one looks good. How much is it?
Twenty-five dollar... Okay, I think I take it.
No need, thank you. I use it myself.
Thank you very much. I will try it tonight.
You too. Goodbye!
