Hello! Yes, I just come back from trip. I visit Chicago for first time.
Oh, it is very nice. Big city, very different from my hometown. I see many tall buildings and... um, how to say... lake. Very big lake.
Yes, Lake Michigan! I walk near there, very beautiful.
Ah, yes! I eat deep dish pizza. It is... um, very thick, with much cheese. Very delicious!
Yes, I go to Art Institute. There are many... um, paintings and old things. Very interesting.
I like the... um, how to say... modern art. It is strange but make me think.
Yes, people are very friendly. One man help me find train station. He say, “Welcome to Chicago!”
It is cold, but I have warm clothes. I like weather, not too rainy.
Yes, I want to visit again. Maybe next time I go with friends.
Thank you! It was very fun. Next time I will tell you more about it.
Yes, see you next time! Bye!
