Hello! I am good, thank you. And you?
Ah, yes. Last month, I go—um, I went to... friend’s wedding. It was very beautiful.
The place was... um, how to say... outside? In garden. Many flower and lights. And everyone is—was happy.
Yes, stunning! I feel very warm and... um, thankful.
Yes! I dance with my friend. And I also drink... uh, wine? Red wine. It was first time for me.
It was... um, not bad. A little sour, but I like it.
I think when my friend... um, how to say... she is crying but also smiling. It was very moving.
I feel very happy and... um, inspired. I think about my life and future.
Yes, exactly. It was a very good time.
Thank you for listen... listening! It was nice to talk about it.
Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
