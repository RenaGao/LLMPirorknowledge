Ah, yes. I want to share Chinese... um, how to say... tradition with others.
Maybe food, like dumpling. And also... um, Chinese New Year celebration.
Yes, I think so. And maybe also show them... um, how to use chopstick.
Yes, I think I need help. Maybe for... um, buying things and setting place.
Maybe next month. I think... um, second weekend is good.
I think maybe 20 people? I will make poster for invite.
Yes, we need some ingredient for dumpling, and also... um, chopstick and plate.
Oh, yes! I can bring red lantern and... um, paper cut. It is very traditional.
Yes, good idea. I can prepare... um, some story and custom about it.
Okay, thank you so much! I think this event will be... um, very nice.
Thank you for helping. I will see you next week.
Okay, I will. Thank you again! Goodbye!
