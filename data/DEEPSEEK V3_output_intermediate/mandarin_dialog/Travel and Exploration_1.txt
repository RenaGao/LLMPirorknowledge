Ah, yes! My favorite place is, um, park near my home. It is very... peaceful.
I like to go there in morning. The air is... um, how to say... very fresh. And I can hear birds singing. It makes me feel... relaxed.
Sometimes I go with my family. We sit on grass and, um, eat food together.
Yes, picnic! It is... happy time.
Yes, I also like to... um, walk. There is small lake, and I walk around it. Sometimes I see... um, big birds, like ducks.
Yes! I bring bread for them. They come very close. It is... um, fun.
I go there last weekend. The weather was... um, good. Not too hot.
Yes, it is my favorite place. I feel... um, how to say... like my mind is clear there.
Thank you for listening. I am... um, happy to talk about it.
Yes, I will go there this weekend. Thank you, and have a good day too!
