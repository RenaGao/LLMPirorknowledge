Good morning, teacher! I am fine, thank you. But I have... um, little confusion about homework.
The last question in assignment. I... I don’t understand what we need to write.
Yes, that one. Is it... um, need to write about... how they are same?
Similarities... okay. But how many? Like, one or two?
Oh, I see! Thank you. But... um, can I use internet for help?
Okay, I will. Um... one more thing. When is… when we need to give the homework?
Friday 5 p.m., I understand. Thank you very much, teacher!
Yes, I will. Thank you again! Have a nice day!
Goodbye, teacher!
