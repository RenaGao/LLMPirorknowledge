Ah, surprise party? Yes, I am free. That sounds very exciting! What is the plan?
Oh, café is good place. She likes it very much. But, um... will it be… how to say… too open? Maybe she will see us before surprise.
Yes, private room is better idea. How many people will come?
Um, 10 is good number. Not too big, not too small. But, uh, we need to make decoration, right?
Yes, I can help. I know place to buy decoration. It’s near my house. Also, I can make... um... food? Or cake?
Ah, yes. She likes chocolate. I will buy chocolate cake. But, um… how we get her to come to party without knowing?
Ah, that’s clever! Her sister can do it. Also, what time we should start?
4 p.m. is good. I will come earlier to help. Maybe 3 p.m.?
No problem! I am happy to help. This will be fun. When we see each other again?
Okay, I will remember. See you on Saturday at 3 p.m.!
Bye!
