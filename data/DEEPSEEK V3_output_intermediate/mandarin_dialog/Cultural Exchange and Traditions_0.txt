Hi! I am good, thank you. How are you?
Ah, yes! My favorite is Spring Festival. It is... um, very important in China.
Yes, exactly! We call it Chun Jie. It is time for family to... um, come together.
We eat big dinner, um, how to say... reunion dinner. And we give red envelope with money inside. It is called... hongbao.
Yes! We put red things everywhere. Red is... um, lucky color. We write words on red paper and stick them on door.
Ah, yes! We eat dumplings. It means... um, good luck and money for next year.
Yes, my family make together. It is fun, but sometime it is difficult to make nice shape.
Yes, it is very happy time. I miss it when I am not in China.
You are welcome! Maybe one day you can see Spring Festival in China.
Thank you for asking! It was nice to talk about it.
You too! Goodbye!
