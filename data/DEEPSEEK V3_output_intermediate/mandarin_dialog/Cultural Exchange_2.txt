Ah, yes. My favorite holiday is, um… Spring Festival. Is biggest festival in China.
Yes, yes, Lunar New Year. We say “Chun Jie” in Chinese. It’s very… um, important for family.
We have big dinner with family. And, um, we give… red envelope to children. Has money inside.
Yes, we eat dumpling. It’s called “jiaozi.” Means… um, good luck for new year.
Yes, we make together. Whole family. It’s… um, very happy time.
Yes, we have red… um, paper on door. Write good words. Like “happiness” or “health.”
You are welcome. Maybe you can visit China in Spring Festival.
Yes, thank you! You too. Goodbye!
