Oh, hello! The price is... um, fifty dollars. But for you, I can make it cheaper. How about... forty-five?
Thirty-five? Maybe... but I also need to earn something. Um, letâ€™s say forty, okay?
Ah, sorry, only cash. There is bank machine near here, if you need.
Of course! I will keep it for you. No worry.
Okay, take your time. I will wait here.
See you soon!
Thank you! Here is your scarf. I hope it make you happy.
You too! Enjoy your new scarf!
