Ah, math test... I feel a little nervous. I am not very good at... um, how to say... the part with numbers and graphs.
Yes, yes! Statistics and graphs. It is difficult for me.
That is good idea! I also have some notes, but... um, I think my notes are not very clear.
Maybe... after class tomorrow? At 3 PM?
Okay, library at 3 PM. Thank you for helping me.
Um, I also not sure about... the part with formulas. Like, remembering all of them.
Flashcards? Ah, yes! I think that will be helpful.
I feel more confident now. Thank you so much!
Yes, see you tomorrow. I will bring my notes and... um, the book.
Okay, we will do our best. See you tomorrow!
