Yes, I think so. But I’m not sure... um, how to say... if they are good for the price.
Sound quality is... um, very important. I like clear sound. And also, they should be... um, comfortable for long time.
Noise... canceling? Ah, yes! That is good. I often take bus, so maybe it is useful.
Wireless is... um, convenient. But I worry about battery. How long it can work?
Oh, 20 hours? That’s not bad. But I also see they are... um, expensive. Do you think it’s worth it?
Hmm... I think I need some time to decide. Maybe I will check other options first.
Thank you so much! You are very helpful. I will think more and maybe come back later.
See you! Have a nice day.
