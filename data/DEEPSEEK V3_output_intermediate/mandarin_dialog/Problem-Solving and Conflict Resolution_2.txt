Yes, of course. I also think this problem... um, we need to fix it.
I think is because... um, the team is not communicate well. Everyone do their own work, but not... share information.
Yes, yes. We can have meeting every week? Or maybe... uh, every few days?
Ah, yes, shared document is good idea. I also think... um, maybe we need one person to, how to say... organize everyone’s work.
Yes, project manager! I think this can help.
Maybe we can... ah, how to say... make a list of all tasks and who is do them? So it’s clear.
Yes, responsibility chart. I think this will help everyone know what they need to do.
Yes, it’s very good plan. I think now we can, um, solve this problem.
Thank you too. It’s nice to work together on this.
Yes, we can talk again next week. See you then!
Goodbye!
