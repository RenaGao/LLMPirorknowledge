Hello, teacher. I have question about homework.
Um, in question number three, I don’t understand what it... uh, means.
Yes, that part. I don’t know how to... um, what is "theme"?
Oh, I think... maybe, joy? Or happiness?
Because the poem has many words like “sun,” “smile,” and “laugh.”
Okay, I can do that. Um, how many sentences?
Yes, teacher. Thank you for... explaining.
I will. Goodbye, teacher!
