Yes, I like reading. But I... how to say... not have much time recently.
Ah, I think... "The Little Prince." It is very famous in my country.
Because... um, it is not only for children. It talks about... how to say... important things in life. Like love, friendship.
Yes, it is easy. The language is simple, but the meaning is deep. I read it in Chinese first, then in English.
Ah, yes. It teach me to... um, appreciate the small things. Like the flower, the stars. It is very... how to say... touching.
Oh, yes. My favorite part is when the fox says... "What is important is invisible to the eye." It is very... um... thoughtful.
Youâ€™re welcome. I think you will like it. It is... um... good for the heart.
Yes, thank you for listening. I hope you enjoy the book!
You too! See you later!
