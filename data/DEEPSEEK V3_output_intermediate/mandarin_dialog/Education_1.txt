Oh, climate change, yes. I can try. Climate change is... how to say... the Earth temperature is increasing? Because of many things like... um, pollution and too much CO2.
Yes, CO2 is... ah, carbon dioxide. It is gas. When we use car or factory, it makes CO2. It trap heat in the air, so Earth become warmer.
Affect many ways. Ice in North and South Pole is melting. Sea level is rising. And weather is... um, strange. More storm and flood.
We can use less energy. For example, turn off light when not use. And maybe... use bus or bicycle instead of car. Also, plant more trees.
Yes, I think government need make policy to stop pollution. Like... um, give money for clean energy or stop using coal.
You’re welcome! I hope it help you understand better.
Good idea. Let’s talk more next time. Bye!
