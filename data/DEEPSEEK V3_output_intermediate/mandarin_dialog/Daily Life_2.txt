Hello! Thank you. My favorite meal is... um, how to say... Chinese dumplings. I like to make it.
Yes, I make from the start. I use... um, flour and water for the... outside. And inside, I put pork and cabbage.
First, I cut... um, chop the cabbage and mix with pork. Then I add salt, sugar, and... um, a little oil. It is very simple.
I mix flour and water until... it become soft. Then I roll it into small... um, circles. It is a bit difficult, but I practice many times.
Usually I boil them, but sometimes I fry. Fried dumplings are more crispy, but boiled is more... traditional.
Yes, my family love it. When we have holiday, we all make dumplings together. It is very fun.
Oh, yes! I can show you. It is not too hard. Maybe next weekend?
Okay, I will prepare things for it. It will be fun!
You’re welcome. I’m happy you like it too. See you then!
Thank you, you too! Goodbye!
