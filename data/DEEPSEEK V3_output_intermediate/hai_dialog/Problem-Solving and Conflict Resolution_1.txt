Ah, yes. My internet... it is very slow. I cannot watch video or open webpage.
Yes, I try. But it still slow. Maybe the router is... um, how to say... broken?
No, not yet. I don’t know how to... um, explain in English.
Okay, I can try. But what if they don’t understand me?
Oh, that is good! I will call them today.
Thank you very much. You are very kind.
Me too. If not, maybe I will change the... um, company?
Yes, service provider. Thank you for your advice.
Sure. I will tell you later. Thank you again!
You too! Goodbye!
