Ah, hello! Iâ€™m good, thank you. How about you?
Oh, yes! I would like. But... um, where we go?
Italian? Um... I not eat Italian food before. Is it spicy?
Ah, yes! I like pizza. But... um, pizza here very big. In Thailand, pizza is small, for one person.
Okay, good idea. After dinner, we do activity?
Walk is nice. I like... how to say... see the city at night.
Yes, I like that. Oh, but... um, what time we meet?
6:30 is okay for me. I come to your place, or we meet at restaurant?
Oh, thank you. I will check map.
Okay, I will. Thank you so much!
Me too! See you at 6:30, okay?
Bye-bye!
