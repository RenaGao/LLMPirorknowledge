Ah, this one... um, it is 1,200 baht. Good quality, handmade.
Um, how to say... I can give discount. Maybe... 1,000 baht?
*[pauses]* 800 baht... if you buy two, I can do 800 each.
Okay, 900 baht. But no more discount, sorry. *[smiles]*
Uh, no card, only cash. Have you cash?
Perfect! Thank you. I will wrap for you.
Yes, I make. My family help too. We come from Chiang Mai.
Thank you. I hope you enjoy.
Thank you too. Please come again!
You too! Goodbye!
