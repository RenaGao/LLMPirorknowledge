Oh, um... yes, I feel little... how to say... unhappy. Because you not come to our lunch.
Yes, we talk on Monday. You say, "Let’s meet on Thursday." I wait for you, but you not come.
It’s okay. But next time, maybe you say clearly? So I not wait and feel... disappointed.
No, no, it’s okay. I understand. Sometimes we have mis... miscommunication.
Um, yes. In my culture, we say directly, but also try to not make... too much trouble.
Yes. So, next time, we confirm plan together. Okay?
Thank you. I feel better now.
You’re welcome. Let’s meet again soon.
That sound good. I will wait your message.
No problem. Have a good day!
