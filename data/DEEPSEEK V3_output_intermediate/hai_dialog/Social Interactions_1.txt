Oh, yes! I have time. Lekâ€™s birthday is coming soon. We should do something special.
Um, maybe we can make a party at her home. She like... uh, how to say... when we all together.
Yes, small party. We can cook food, play games, and... uh, give her gift.
She like Thai food. Maybe we make som tam and... um, pad thai? I can help cook.
Yes, we invite Pim and Nam too. They like Lek. It will be... uh, more fun.
Maybe Friday evening? She is free then. We can say we meet for... um, how to say... casual dinner. But it is surprise.
