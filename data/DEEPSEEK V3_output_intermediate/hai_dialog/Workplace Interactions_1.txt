Yes, I do some website before. But I not expert. I use, um... how to say... tools like HTML and CSS.
JavaScript... ah, yes, but I not very sure. I know basic, but I need to practice more.
Yes, ready. But, um... what is... the first thing I should do?
Oh, I see. So HTML is like... um, the bone? And CSS is... the skin?
Okay, I think I understand. But if I have question, can I ask you?
Thank you so much! I will try my best.
Good idea. I start with HTML now?
