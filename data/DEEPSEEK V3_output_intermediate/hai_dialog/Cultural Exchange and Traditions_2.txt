Yes, I want to make event about Thai culture. I want people to know our traditions.
Um... maybe we can do Thai dancing. And also, people can try Thai food.
I think pad thai, som tam... and maybe mango sticky rice. It is very famous.
Yes, like... how to say... “fon” dance. We use fan and wear beautiful dress.
I will show them basic step. Maybe they can follow. It is fun, I think.
