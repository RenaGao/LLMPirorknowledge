Yes, I have. I think, um, test is next week. I feel a little nervous.
Not yet. I want to start, but I donâ€™t know... how to say, good way to study.
For me, grammar is difficult, especially... uh, what is it, present perfect?
Yes, that is good idea. Also, I need help with... um, listening part.
Podcasts? What is that?
Ah, I see. I will try. Thank you for... um, explaining.
Tomorrow is good for me. What time?
Yes, 3 PM is okay. I will bring my... um, note and book.
Good idea. I think together we can... do better.
Okay, see you tomorrow. Thank you for help.
Thank you. I will try my best. See you!
