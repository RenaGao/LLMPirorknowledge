Ah, yes, thank you. I try to find... um, the big clock tower. The... um, how to say... landmark?
Yes, yes! That one. I not know how to go there.
I am here, at... um, the shopping mall. The big one.
Straight? No turn left or right?
Ah, okay. Fountain is... water thing, right?
Thank you! I think I can go there.
Okay, thank you so much. Then I will walk... go to the fountain.
Yes, I will. Thank you again. Have a nice day!
Goodbye!
