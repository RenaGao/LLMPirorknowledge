Hi! I’m good, thank you. How about you?
Oh, yes! In Thailand, we have Songkran. It is... um, Thai New Year.
We, um, throw water. Everyone throw water to each other. It is for, uh... how to say... clean and good luck for new year.
Yes, we eat food like... khao chae. It is rice in cold water with, um, side dish. And we also go to temple to pray and... uh, pour water on Buddha statue.
Yes, everywhere! But some place, um, have big party with music and, uh, people come from other country too.
Yes, my family and friends. We spend time together and... um, have fun with water.
Ah, yes! Last year, I go to Chiang Mai. It is very famous for Songkran. The water fight there is... um, how to say... very big and exciting!
You should come! I think you will enjoy it very much.
You are welcome! I’m happy to tell you. If you come, I will show you everything.
Yes, let’s! I will plan for you. Thank you for listening.
You too! See you later!
