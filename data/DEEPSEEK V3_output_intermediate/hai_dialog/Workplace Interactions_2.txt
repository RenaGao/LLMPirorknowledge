Ah, yes, I think I am free. Um, what time?
Yes, 10 a.m. is fine. But... um, maybe we can make it 10:30? I have one thing to finish before.
Hmm... I think we talk about new project first. And then, um... how to say... the budget?
Yes, budget plan. Also, um... team... team work schedule?
Oh, training! Yes, I forget. We must talk about that too. And maybe... um, ask feedback from team?
Yes, that sound good. I will... um, prepare some note for new project part.
Yes, I can do that. Um... where we meet? In meeting room?
Okay, thank you. I feel... um, more confident now. See you Wednesday!
You too! Goodbye!
