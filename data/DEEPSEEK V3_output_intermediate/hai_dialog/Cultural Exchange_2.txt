Oh, yes! I can talk. My favorite holiday is... um, Songkran.
It is Thai New Year. We celebrate in April. We... how to say... throw water to each other.
Yes, water fight! But also, it is for... um, washing bad thing away. So, it is... special.
Yes, I go to my family. We... um, give respect to old people. We pour water on their hands.
Ah, yes! We eat... how to say... noodle with curry. It is... Khao Soi.
Yes, very tasty! And also, we have... um, fruit like mango with sweet sticky rice.
Yes, it is fun! Everyone is happy. We play water, eat food, and... um, spend time with family.
You should come! I can... um, show you how to throw water.
Thank you! You have a good day too. See you later!
