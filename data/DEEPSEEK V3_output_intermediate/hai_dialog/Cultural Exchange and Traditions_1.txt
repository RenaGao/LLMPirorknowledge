Ah, yes, thank you. In Thailand, we use spoon and fork most time. Chopsticks is more for noodle. And we... um, share food. Everyone eat from same dish.
Yes, we use spoon for eat, and fork is for... how to say... pushing food. Also, we never stick chopsticks in rice. It look like... um, for dead people.
Yes, never touch someone’s head. It is rude. And when you eat with older people, you should wait for them to eat first.
Actually, it is same. We also keep hands on table. But we don’t... um, point with feet. Feet is lowest part of body.
When someone pour drink for you, you hold glass with two hand. It show respect. And when you cheers, glass should be lower than older person.
Not all time. Some restaurant already have service charge. But if not, we leave small tip. Just coins or... um, 10% of bill.
In some country, people eat alone. In Thailand, we always eat together. It feel strange to eat alone. And... fork in left hand, spoon in right? I find it difficult.
Thank you too! It’s nice to talk about this. Maybe one day we eat together, and I show you Thai food.
Yes, take care too. See you next time!
