Oh, hi! My morning is... um, usual. I wake up six o’clock, then I take shower.
Yes, I have. I eat rice and egg... um, omelette. And coffee, of course!
I add milk, no sugar. I like... how to say... creamy taste?
Ah, I check email and plan work. But I also do... uh, thing for body, like... stretching?
Yes, yes! Yoga. It help me feel better for day.
Sometimes, yes. But more often, I listen to... uh, sound of bird outside. It is peaceful.
I start work eight o’clock. I work from home, so it is... convenient.
Yes, I take break at ten o’clock. I drink water and walk around house... um, for relax.
I use notebook. I write list of thing to do. It help me not forget.
My favorite is yoga and coffee. It make me feel... ready for day.
Thank you! I like talk about it. And your morning? How is it?
Yes, you should try! It very good. Okay, I go now. See you again!
