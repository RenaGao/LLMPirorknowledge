Hello, Alex. My name is Nuch. I have problem with my computer.
Um, my computer is... how to say... not turn on. Screen is black.
Yes, no light, no sound. Just black.
Yes, I check. The charger is connect, but still not work.
Okay, I try. *pauses* Um, still not work.
I think no... my battery is... inside. Not come out.
Okay, I do now. *pauses* Still nothing.
Yes, sometimes it is... um... very slow. And it make noise.
Oh, I think it is... um... ASUS 5... something. I donâ€™t remember.
Ah, yes! It is ASUS 550.
Yes, that is okay. Thank you, Alex.
No, that is all. Thank you for your help.
You too. Goodbye!
