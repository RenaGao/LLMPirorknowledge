Ah, hi! I am... um, good. Yes, I have plan. I want to go Chatuchak Park.
I want to... um, walk around. And maybe shop. Ah, how to say... buy some things.
Yes, weather is good. I want to go early, so... um, not too hot.
I think... um, 8:30. Is that okay?
Yes, I go with my friend Lek. She will... um, bring some food.
Yes, and I will prepare drink. We can eat and... um, talk together.
She will bring... um, Thai food. Maybe som tam and sticky rice.
Yes, I think so. We will meet at 8:30 and then go to park.
Thank you! I am very excited.
I will tell you. Okay, I need to go now. Bye!
You too! Goodbye!
