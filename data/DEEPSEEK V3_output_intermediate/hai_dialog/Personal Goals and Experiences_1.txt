Ah, yes. I want learn... um, how to say... speaking English better. Is it... important for my job.
Because my company, they have many... um, foreign clients. I need talk with them, but sometimes I feel... not confident.
I think... maybe join English class. And also I watch YouTube, but sometimes it’s... um, too fast for me.
Oh, yes! I didn’t know I can do that. Thank you for... telling me.
Grammar is... difficult for me. Sometimes I say, “He have” instead of “He has.” And I don’t know many... um, difficult words.
Yes, I try Duolingo before. It’s good, but I need more... um, speaking practice.
Conversation club? Yes, I think I will find one. Thank you for... your advice.
I hope so. Thank you for... talking with me. It helps a lot.
Thank you! I will try my best. See you again!
