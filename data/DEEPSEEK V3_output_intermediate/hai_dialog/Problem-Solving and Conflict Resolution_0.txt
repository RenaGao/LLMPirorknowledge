Ah, yes. I also want talk about it. Please tell me.
Oh, um... I think maybe I make mistake. I remember 8:30, but maybe I say wrong to your friend. Sorry for that.
Yes, 8:30 is fine. I will come on time. I prepare food, like I say before.
That’s good! I hope weather is nice. How to say... not too hot.
Yes, that’s good idea. And we can also... um, sit near the lake?
Me too. I’m happy we fix this... misunderstanding.
Yes, communication is important. I learn this.
Yes, see you on Saturday. And thank you for talk with me.
You too! See you soon. Goodbye!
