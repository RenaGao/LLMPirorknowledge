Hello, Teacher. Yes, I have... um, question about homework.
The exercise about, uh, past tense. I not sure... how to write sentence correct.
The sentence... um, "She go to market yesterday." I think it wrong, but I donâ€™t know how fix.
Um... "went"?
Ah, yes! Thank you. And what about... "He have a book"?
"He had." Okay, I think I understand now.
"Ate."
Thank you, Teacher. Your explain very clear.
Yes, I will ask if I... um, need more help.
Thank you, Teacher. See you next class!
