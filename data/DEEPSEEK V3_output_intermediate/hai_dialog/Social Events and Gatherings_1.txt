Oh, surprise party? Yes, I free! I want to join. When it will be?
Saturday evening? Yes, it’s okay. Where we do it?
Yes, I can help. Um... how to say... I can bring food? Maybe Thai dish?
I think... pad Thai. It is easy to make and everyone like it.
Okay. What time I should come?
4 PM? Yes, I come. Oh, does Sarah know about party?
Ah, I understand. I won’t tell her. Promise.
Hmm... maybe we play music? Sarah like to dance.
Um... maybe we take photo? To remember the fun time.
Okay. I think it will be very fun. I’m excited!
Yes, see you on Saturday. I can’t wait!
