Oh, yes. I just finish... um, complete my English course. It is... first time I study English seriously.
It take three month. I study every day after work.
I want to... how to say... improve my skill. Because I need English for my job.
I feel very happy. And also... um, proud for myself.
Um... grammar is hard. And also... pronouncing words. Sometimes people not understand me.
Yes! I learn many new word. And also... I like listening to English song now.
I want to speak more with native speaker. Like you! And maybe one day, I can take... um, English test like TOEFL.
Thank you. You are very kind.
Yes, I will try my best. Thank you for talking with me.
Thank you! Goodbye!
