I’m good, thank you! How about you?
Oh, that sound fun! Where we go?
Beach is nice. I like swim and sunbathing. What you think?
Maybe… um, Phuket? It’s very famous in Thailand.
We can snorkeling, um… visit island, and eat seafood. Very delicious!
Maybe December? Weather is nice, not too hot.
I think… five to seven days is good. Not too short, not too long.
Yes, Lek and Pim also want to go. They like travel too.
Yes, I can find tour for snorkeling and island trip.
Okay! I’m so excited. Thank you for plan together.
See you soon!
