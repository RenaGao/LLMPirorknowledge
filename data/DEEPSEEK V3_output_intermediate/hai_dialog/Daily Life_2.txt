Oh, yes! My favorite meal is... um, how to say... spicy soup with coconut milk. In Thai, we call it “tom kha gai.”
It have chicken, mushroom, and... um, lemongrass. Also, chili and coconut milk. Very spicy but good!
First, I boil chicken in water. Then I put lemongrass, chili, and... um, thing that make smell good... ginger?
Yes, ginger. After that, I add coconut milk and mushroom. Then cook until everything... uh, ready to eat.
Yes. I put cilantro and... uh, lime juice. It make more fresh taste.
Sure! I can teach you. Maybe next weekend?
Yes, we need chicken, mushroom, lemongrass, chili, coconut milk, and... oh, I forget, fish sauce.
Thank you! I think you will like this meal. It is... um, comfort food for Thai people.
You’re welcome. I’m happy to cook with you. See you next weekend then!
Yes, it will be fun! Bye for now.
