Oh, hello! Yes, I try, but some part I not understand. Like... um, the equation with letter?
Yes, yes! Variable. I confuse how to find the... the answer for "x."
Um, yes. We must make "x" alone, right? So... minus 3 from both side?
Next, divide both side by 2. So, "x" is... 2?
Ah, yes, I think so. But sometimes, the equation have more... um, complicated?
Okay, but I think I need time for understand. Maybe we can... um, meet again tomorrow?
Thatâ€™s good idea. Thank you so much for help me!
Yes, see you tomorrow! Thank you again!
