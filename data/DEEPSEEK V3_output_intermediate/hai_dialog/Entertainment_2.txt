Oh, yes! I like reading very much. But I read slowly because English is... um, not my first language.
Yes, I like book called... um... *The Alchemist*. It’s my favorite.
It’s about... how to say... boy who travel to find his... um, dream? Yes, his dream. It teaches about life and... uh... trying hard for what you want.
I think it make you strong in... um, in your heart. It helps when you feel lost. And it’s not too long, so it’s good for people who... um... don’t like big books.
Yes, it’s written simple. Even for me, I can understand most. But sometimes I need to check... um, dictionary for words.
Yes! I read two times. First time in Thai, but second time in English. It’s different... um, how to say... experience?
Yes, I think so. It’s like learning twice.
You’re welcome. I hope you like it too.
Okay! I will think about it. Thank you for talking with me.
You too. Bye-bye!
