Hello, Sarah. My name is Noi. Nice to meet you too.
Uh, I like to watch movie. Also, I enjoy cooking, but not very good yet.
I like romantic movie... um, comedy too. But romantic is my favorite.
Yes, I like... um, how to say... "The Notebook." Have you watch it?
I try to make Thai food. Pad Thai is... I think very famous in my country.
Not so often. But my mom teach me. I still make mistake sometimes.
Yes, I like Japanese food. Sushi is my favorite.
No, I never try. It looks hard. Maybe one day I will learn.
Um... I like to travel. But now, I cannot because... no time.
I want to visit Japan. It is beautiful, and I like the culture.
Really? That is nice. Maybe you can tell me about your trip next time.
Yes, me too. Thank you, Sarah. See you next time!
