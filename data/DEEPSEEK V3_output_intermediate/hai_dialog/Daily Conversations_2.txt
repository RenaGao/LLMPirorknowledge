Ah, yes, thank you. Um, last week I go to... uh, my friend’s wedding. It was very special.
Yes, it was very beautiful. The place is... um, near the river. And they have many flower, very colorful. I feel happy and... uh... how to say... emotional?
Yes, I join ceremony. We give flower to... uh... bride and groom. It’s Thai tradition. Also, we dance and eat many delicious food.
I feel... um, very warm and happy. My friend is very important for me, so seeing her so happy make me also happy.
My favorite part is... uh, when we dance together. Everyone are laughing and having fun. It make me feel... uh... connected?
Yes, it was. I want to... um, remember it for long time.
Thank you for listening. It was nice talk about it.
Yes, that’s good idea. Let’s meet again.
You too. Goodbye!
