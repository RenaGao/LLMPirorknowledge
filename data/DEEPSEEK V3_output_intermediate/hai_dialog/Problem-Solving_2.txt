Ah, hello! I am... fine, thank you. But, um... I have something to tell you.
I want to say sorry because I... I forget to bring the book you lend me. I feel very bad for this.
Yes, I think it is at my home. I leave it on my table when I... uh, how to say... when I go to work.
Maybe... tomorrow? I can bring it to you in the morning. Is that okay?
Um... maybe 9 oâ€™clock? Or... 9:30? You choose.
Okay, thank you for understand. I will not forget again. Promise.
Yes, I try to... to be careful next time. I want to make it up to you. Maybe I can buy you coffee?
Okay, if you say so. But I still want to say thank you for being so nice.
Yes, see you tomorrow. And sorry again.
You too! Goodbye!
