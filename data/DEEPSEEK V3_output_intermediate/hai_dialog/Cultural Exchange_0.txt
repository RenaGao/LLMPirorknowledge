Ah, yes! We have... um, Songkran Festival. It is very special for Thai people.
It is Thai New Year. We celebrate in April. We... um... how to say... we throw water to each other.
Yes, yes! Water fight, but it is also... um... for good luck and clean... clean something?
Yes! Cleansing! We believe water make us clean for new year.
Yes, we go to temple. We give food to monk and... um... pour water on Buddha statue.
Big, yes! Everywhere, people play with water. In Bangkok, Chiang Mai, many place.
No special clothes, but people wear... um... flower shirt. Like bright color.
Oh, yes! When I was young, my family go to Chiang Mai. We play water all day, and eat... um... Thai food. Very happy time.

Youâ€™re welcome! I hope you can come to Thailand for Songkran.
Thank you! You too. Goodbye!
