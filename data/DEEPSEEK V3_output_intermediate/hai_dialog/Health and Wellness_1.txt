Hi! I’m okay, but... um, I feel tired many time. Maybe because of work.
I try, but... um, I not sleep enough, and I eat fast food many time.
Yes, I think so. But I don’t know... how to say... healthy food recipe.
Ah, vegetables... yes, I like it. But I think I need to... cook it. How to do?
Exercise? Um... sometimes I walk, but not much.
Okay, I will try. And... um, I think I need to sleep more early.
10 PM? Oh, I think it’s good idea. I will do it.
Yes, sound good! Thank you for help me.
Okay, see you next week!
You too! Bye!
