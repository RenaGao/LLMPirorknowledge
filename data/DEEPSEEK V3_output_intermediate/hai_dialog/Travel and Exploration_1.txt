Ah, yes! My favorite place is... um, Chiang Mai. It is in north of Thailand.
I like because, um... it is calm. Not busy like Bangkok. And have many... how to say... temple?
Yes, Buddhist temples. Very beautiful. I feel... peace when I go there.
Not so often because I live in Bangkok. But I go... maybe two time every year.
I like eat... um, northern food. It is spicy but very tasty! And I also go to... um, mountain. Doi Suthep.
Yes, yes! The temple is very special for Thai people. You can see all Chiang Mai from there.
Um... I think the people. They are very kind and... friendly. You feel... welcome.
You should go! I think you will like it, too.
Thank you! It was nice to talk.
Yes, see you there! Goodbye!
