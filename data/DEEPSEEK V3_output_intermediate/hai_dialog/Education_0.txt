Hello! I’m good, thank you. How about you?
Oh, exam… I feel a little nervous. Many things to remember.
Um, I think… the grammar part. It’s confusing for me. Like, when to use “he has” or “he have.”
Oh, yes, “he has.” I always forget. And also, um… vocabulary is hard.
Yes, that would be good! Maybe we meet… um, on Friday?
Yes, library is good. What time?
Three p.m. is okay. I will bring my book and… um, notes.
Thank you so much. I feel better now.
Yes, together is better.
Okay, see you then!
Thank you! You too. Bye!
