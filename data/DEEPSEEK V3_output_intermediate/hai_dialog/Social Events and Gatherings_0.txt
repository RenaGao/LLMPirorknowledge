Hello, Alex. My name is Nuch. Nice to meet you.
I live here now. I move to this city... um, three months before.
It is good. People very friendly. But, um... the weather is very cold for me.
I from Thailand. Bangkok is my home.
I miss the food. Thai food is... how to say... very special. And also my family.
Yes, I try. But some ingredient is... um... difficult to find.
Yes, there is one. Not same as home, but... it’s okay.
I work in hospital. I am... um, nurse.
Yes, I like to help people. But sometimes, many patients make me tired.
Thank you. And you? What is your work?
Very nice! I think English is... um, very hard.
Thank you. It’s nice to talk with you, Alex.
Yes, I hope so. Goodbye!
