Ah, hello! Um, it’s okay. I work on the report, but I need more time.
Maybe... Friday? I have some problem with the data—um, numbers not match.
Yes, please. How to say... I not sure how to fix.
Tomorrow morning, uh, 10 o’clock?
Ah, slides finish already. I just check again for mistake.
Um... no, I think that’s all. Thank you for your help.
Okay, I will try my best. See you tomorrow, 10 o’clock.
You too! Thank you.
