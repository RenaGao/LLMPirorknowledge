Ah, yes. I think we can talk about... um, the new project? And also maybe... the budget?
Um... how to say... maybe we discuss the… team training? It is, um, necessary, I think.
Maybe... 10 o’clock? Is it good for everyone?
We can use the meeting room... um, Room 3? It is big enough.
Maybe one hour? Or two? If we have many topic.
Yes, I can. But I need some help with the... um, data analysis part.
Thank you! That is helpful.
Um... I think no. The agenda is... complete, I think.
Yes, it is good. Thank you for your help.
Okay, see you next week! Have a nice day.
