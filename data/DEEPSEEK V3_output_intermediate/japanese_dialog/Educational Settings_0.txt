Ah, hello, Mr. Johnson. I... um, have question about the assignment. I don't understand... how to say... the part about research.
Yes, that part. I not sure... what kind of source is okay? Books? Or only Internet?
Reliable? You mean... um, not fake news?
Ah, I understand. And how many source I need?
Okay. And... um, if I find source, what I do next? Write summary?
I see. Thank you very much. This is more clear now.
Yes, I will. Um, Mr. Johnson, when is the... due date?
Oh, thatâ€™s good. I will start soon. Thank you again!
Yes, I will. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Goodbye!
