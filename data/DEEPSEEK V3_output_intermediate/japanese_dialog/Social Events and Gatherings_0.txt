Ah, hello! My name is Hiroshi. Nice to, um, meet you.
Yes, I come with my friend, uh, Takeshi. He is... somewhere in the room.
We know each other... uh, for three years? We meet at university.
I study... how to say... engineering. Yes, mechanical engineering.
I like making things work. Uh, designing machine is very... um, satisfying.
Yes, I make small robot last year. It can... um, move by itself.

I hope so. I want to make more things that help people.
Yes, thank you very much, Sarah! I enjoy talking with you.
Yes, enjoy the party! See you later!
