Ah, yes, I study… um, but I feel not ready. There are many things to remember.
Vocabulary is hard. And also… grammar rules. They are complicated.
Flashcards? Uh, no, I not use them yet. But it sounds good idea.
Writing sentences? Yes, I can try. But sometimes I don’t know… how to make correct sentence.
Thank you. I will try. How about you? Are you ready for test?
Me too. Maybe we can study together? It is more… um, easier with friend.
Yes, good plan. What time is best for you?
3 p.m. is okay. I will come.
Yes, I will bring them. Thank you for your help.
Yes, let’s do our best. See you tomorrow!
