Hello! I am fine, thank you. And you?
Ah, no plan yet. Maybe... um, spend time with family?
Picnic? Yes, good idea! But... where we can go?
Ah, I know that place. I think it is... um, good for picnic.
Maybe... sushi? Or, um... sandwiches? And also drink.
Yes, thank you. Also, my family can bring... um, fruit and tea.
Um... maybe 11 oâ€™clock? Is okay?
Yes, park entrance. I will... um, make map for my family.
Me too. Thank you for organizing.
Yes, see you! Goodbye!
