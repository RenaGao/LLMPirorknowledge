Ah, yes, I am very sorry for the mistake. I… um, how to say… I didn’t check the data carefully.
The numbers… um, the numbers were not correct. I think I make mistake with the calculation.
Uh, maybe in the… the sales part. I will check again and fix it.
Maybe… um, one hour? I will do it now.
Yes, thank you. I will send the correct report soon.
I am really sorry again for the trouble.
Yes, I will be careful next time. Thank you for understanding.
That is good idea. I will do my best.
Thank you. I will send the report soon. See you later.
