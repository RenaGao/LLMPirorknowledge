Ah, yes! I think it is good idea. Rika is very kind, so she will be happy, I think.
Um... party is good, but maybe... how to say... not too many people? She like calm thing, I think.
Oh, yes! She like sushi very much. There is... um... sushi place near her house.
I think maybe five or six people is enough. Too many people... um... make her feel… nervous?
Ah, yes. She like reading books. Maybe we give her... um... new book?
She like... um... mystery and history... um, how to say... history mystery?
Yes! Historical mystery. I think she will like it very much.
Maybe... um... small balloon and card? Not too big, but... um... festive?
Yes, I can do it. Thank you for planning with me!
Yes, 6 p.m. is good. I will... um... come early to set up balloon.
Yes! I think she will be very surprised and happy. See you next week!
Yes, let’s talk again before the day. Goodbye!
