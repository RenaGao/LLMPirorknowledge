Ah, yes! This bowl is... um, 3,000 yen. About... 20 dollars?
Hmm... lower? Maybe... 2,500 yen? It is... very good wood. Handmade.
Um... 2,000 yen is... a little low. But, because you seem nice person, I can do... 2,300 yen.
Ah... okay, 2,200 yen. But please, um... tell your friends about my shop!
Thank you! I will wrap it... um... in paper for you.
Thank you too! Please, come back again. Have a nice day!
Yes, see you! Goodbye!
