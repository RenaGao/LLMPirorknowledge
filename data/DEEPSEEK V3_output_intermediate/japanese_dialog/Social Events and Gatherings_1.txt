Oh, surprise party for Hana? That is… very good idea! She will be happy, I think.
Um… maybe we can do at her favorite restaurant? Or… how to say… at someone’s house?
Ah, decorations… maybe balloons and… um… banner? Like, “Welcome Hana!” or something.
Yes, that is nice. And… um… we need cake, right? Hana likes… strawberry cake.
Maybe her… closest friends? Like, Miki, Rina, and… um… Kenji. Also, her family if they can come.
Yes, it is surprise, so we must keep secret. But… um… how to tell her to come?
Oh, that is clever! She will not suspect.
Yes, Saturday evening is good. Most people can come, I think.
Um… maybe… small gift? Like, something she really likes.
Yes, that is good idea. I think she will be very happy.
Yes, thank you too! I am excited for Hana. See you next week!
