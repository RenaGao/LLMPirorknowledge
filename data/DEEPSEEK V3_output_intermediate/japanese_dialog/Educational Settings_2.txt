Ah, yes, I can try. This problem is about… um, how to say… area of… triangle?
Oh, formula is… um, one-half times base times height. You need to find base first.
Ah, yes. This triangle is… um, right triangle. So, height is same as one side.
Yes, yes. And base is… this side. So you can calculate now.
Yes, please try. I will check your answer.
Yes, very good! You understand now?
I am glad. Um, if you have more question, please ask.
Thank you. I try my best.
You’re welcome. See you next time!
