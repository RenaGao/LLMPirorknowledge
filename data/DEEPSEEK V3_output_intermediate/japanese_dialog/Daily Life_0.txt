Then I take shower. After, I eat breakfast. Usually bread and eggs.
Yes, I like green tea. It is... um, how to say... calming for me.
After breakfast, I prepare bag and, um... wear clothes. Then I go to office by train.
Yes, usually 8:30. Sometimes... traffic is bad, so I leave early.
Thank you. And you? What is your morning... routine?
