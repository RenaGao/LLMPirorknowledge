Ah, hello! Yes, I study math now. But... um, I have problem with... how to say... this part. It is about... um, function.
Yes, quadratic! I understand... um, basic part. But when it is more complex, I feel... how to say... confused.
Ah, graphing is okay. But solving... um, equation when it has... uh, more than one variable. It is difficult.
Yes, yes! System of equation. I canâ€™t find... um, the way to solve it fast.
Ah, yes, please! I try to understand, but... um, it is not clear in my head.
Ah, I see! So, we put y = 5 - x into number 2 equation. Then, we can find x, right?
I will try! Thank you so much. This is... um, more clear now.
Elimination? Ah, yes, I read about it. But I think I need more practice.
That is very kind! I would like it very much.
Yes, thank you! I will try my best. See you next time!
