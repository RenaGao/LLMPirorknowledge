Here’s a conversation between a native English speaker (NS) and a Japanese L2 speaker (L2) discussing a technical issue with a service provider:
Yes, my internet is very slow. It is... um, not working well since yesterday.
Yes, I try this, but... still same problem. Maybe something wrong with provider?
Not yet. I think... how to say... I don’t know how to explain it in English.
Oh, outage? Sorry, I don’t know this word.
Ah, I see. I didn’t check this, but maybe I should do it.
Calling is difficult for me because... my English is not so good.
Live chat? Yes, that is better. I can use chat.
Thank you very much. You are very kind.
Yes, please. I want to say... my internet is slow, and restart router doesn’t fix it.
Perfect! Thank you so much. I will send this now.
I will. Thank you again for your kind help.
Yes, I hope too. Thank you, and
