Ah, yes! My favorite place is Kyoto. I go there many times.
Kyoto is... um, how to say... very historical. Many old temple and... uh, traditional thing.
Yes, traditional culture! And also, food is very... um, delicious.
My favorite is... um, Kyoto-style noodles. They call it "kyouto-ryouri."
Yes, there is small restaurant near Kiyomizu Temple. It is very quiet and... uh, how to say... feeling of old Japan.
Yes, I like Kinkaku-ji. It is... uh, golden temple. Very beautiful in autumn.
Usually I go with friends. We take photo and... um, enjoy nature together.
Hmm... yes, Arashiyama. There is bamboo forest. When I walk there, I feel... uh, calm and happy.
