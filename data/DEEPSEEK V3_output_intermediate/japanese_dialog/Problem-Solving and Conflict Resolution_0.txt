Ah, hello. I’m very sorry for cancel. I had... um, sudden problem with work.
Yes, it is okay now. But I feel bad for canceling. Maybe I should... um, tell you sooner next time.
No, I’m okay. Thank you for worried about me.
Yes, please. How about next Saturday?
Um, maybe 2 p.m.?
Yes, café is good. I am looking forward to it.
Thank you for understand. I am happy we can talk about this.
Yes, see you next Saturday. Have a good week!
