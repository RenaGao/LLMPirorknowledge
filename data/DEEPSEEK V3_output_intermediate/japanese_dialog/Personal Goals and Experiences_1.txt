Ah, hello! I want to... um, learn cooking. Because, um... how to say... I live alone now, so need to make food myself.
I like Japanese food, but also want to try... um, Western style. Maybe Italian?
Yes, I want to make pasta. But, um... I don’t know how to make sauce. It’s... difficult for me.
Ah, yes! I saw one class near my home. But, um... it’s in English. I’m not sure if I can understand everything.
Maybe... yes, I think I will try. It’s important for me to learn because, um... I want to be more independent.
Yes! Also, my friends like to eat together. If I cook, they will be happy.
Thank you for encouraging me. I will try the class next week!
Yes, I will! Thank you and goodbye!
