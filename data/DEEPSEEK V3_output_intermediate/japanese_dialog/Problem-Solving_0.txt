Ah, yes. What is it?
Oh! I am very sorry. Um… how to say… I think there is misunderstanding.
Yes. I work in the morning, but… uh, in the afternoon my boss say, “You can go home early.” So, I meet friends in park. But, I forget to tell you I am free.
No, no! I really want to come to your party, but I think it is too late to say “I can come” now.
I am very sorry. I should tell you my plan change. Please forgive me.
Thank you for… uh, how to say… understanding me. Next time, I will think more.
Yes, I agree. Thank you for telling me your feeling.
Yes, honesty is very important. I will remember this.
Yes, let’s meet again. Thank you, and… um, see you later!
