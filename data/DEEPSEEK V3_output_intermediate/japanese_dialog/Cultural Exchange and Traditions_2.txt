Ah, yes, hello! Thank you for ask. It is... interesting topic. I have time.
In Japan, we say "itadakimasu" before eat. It means... um, gratefulness for food. Also, we use chopsticks, and is not good to put chopsticks in rice straight.
Hmm... maybe... slurping noodles? In Japan, it is okay, but I heard in U.S., it is not polite?
Sharing food... in Japan, we have small plate for share. But we not use our own... um, chopsticks to take food. It is... how to say... bad impression.
Um... yes. In U.S., people sometimes eat with hand, like pizza or sandwich. In Japan, we always use chopsticks or fork. And... also, tipping. Japanese restaurant not need tip, but U.S. is need tip, right?
Yes, very interesting! I learn many new thing today.
Thank you also. It was nice... um, nice talking with you. Have a good day!
