Ah, hello! I am fine, thank you. But... um, I feel little tired these days.
Sleep? Maybe not so much. I work late, and then... um, I watch TV before sleep.
Ah, reading book. That is good idea. But sometimes... how to say... I feel too tired to read.
Exercise? Yes, I think it is good. But I don’t have time... um, I am very busy.
Lunch break... hmm, maybe I try that. And also, I think my food is not so healthy.
I eat... um, fast food or convenience store food. It is quick, but... not good, I think.
Preparing meal... yes, but I don’t know how to cook many things.
Ah, that is very kind. Thank you! I will try to cook little by little.
Yes, I think so too. So... sleep better, walk more, and cook healthy food.
I will! Thank you for your advice. See you next time!
Goodbye!
