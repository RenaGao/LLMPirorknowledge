Ah, yes! Japanese festival... um, I think Obon is very special. It is for, uh, respecting ancestors.
Usually in... August, but some place is July. People visit family grave and clean it.
Yes, people make food offering, and... um, there is dance called Bon Odori. It is traditional dance.
Yes, music is... um, folk music? People wear yukata, it is... light kimono, and dance in circle.
Yes, lantern is... very important. People put lantern in river or sea to guide ancestor spirits.
Um, yes. We eat... oh, how to say... dumpling? Oh, mochi, and also somen, it is cold noodle.
Mostly, yes. But... each area has little different way. For example, in Kyoto, there is Gozan no Okuribi, it is... big fire on mountain.
Yes, it is very important for Japanese people. I hope you can see it one day!
Thank you too! Have a nice day, and goodbye!
