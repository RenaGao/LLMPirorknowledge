Hi! Um, yes, I have some plan. I think I want to visit city near here.
Hmm, how to say... it is famous for food and temple. Um, Kyoto? Yes, Kyoto.
I want to see, um, old temple and try, uh, Kyoto food. It is very... how to say... traditional?
Yes, I go with my friend. She also like to go there.
I think to take, um, fast train. Shinkansen? But maybe expensive.
Ah, yes, bus is also good idea. It is... how to say... cheaper.
We plan to leave on Saturday morning, um, nine oâ€™clock.
Yes, I want to see, um, Kinkaku-ji. It is... gold temple? Very beautiful.
Yes, I think so too. And I want to eat... um, Kyoto dessert.
Ah, yes, matcha! I heard it is very good.
Yes, I will tell you. Thank you for talking with me. See you!
