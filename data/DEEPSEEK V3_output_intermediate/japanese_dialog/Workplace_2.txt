Ah, hello Sarah-san. Thank you. I am... um, Kenji. Nice to meet you.
Yes, but... um, in my last company, the system was different. Here, I am not sure how to... how to start.
Data... is it in the computer? Maybe in Excel?
Yes, I see it. But, um, there are many files. Which one I should use?
Ah, got it. Thank you. And then... um, what should I do with the data?
A little. I think... I can make table. But maybe I need help for compare.
Okay, I will try. Thank you, Sarah-san.
Yes, I understand. Friday is deadline. I will finish it.
Thank you. I will... um, ask if I need help.
Thank you, Sarah-san. I will do my best.
Yes, tomorrow is good. Thank you!
See you tomorrow!
