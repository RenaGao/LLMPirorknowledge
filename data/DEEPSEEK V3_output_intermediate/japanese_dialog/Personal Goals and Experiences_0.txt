I will study every day. Maybe… um, 30 minutes? And I want to practice speaking more.
Ah, yes. I use… um, how to say… YouTube? To listen English video. And I find teacher for speaking practice.
Yes, I want to travel. I plan to visit… um… Australia. But I need save money first.
I will eat… um, less outside. And I stop buy… uh, unnecessary thing.
I want see… nature. Like beach and forest. And I want practice English with local people.
Yes, I hope so. But I am little nervous. My English is not yet perfect.
