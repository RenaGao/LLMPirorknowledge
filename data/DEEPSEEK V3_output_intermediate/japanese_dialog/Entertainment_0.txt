Ah, favorite movie... I think “Spirited Away” is very good. Do you know it?
Um... the story is... very magical, and the picture is beautiful. I feel... how to say... calm when I watch it.
Yes, No-Face is interesting. But I like Haku most. He is... um, kind and strong.
Yes, I watch many anime. Also, I like... um, drama TV show. Like... “Midnight Diner.”
Yes, the owner cook food, and each episode has... uh, different story. It is very warm and... um, how to say... makes me feel happy.
Hmm... I like “Your Name.” It is... very romantic and the music is beautiful.
Yes, and the story is... um, makes me feel many emotion.
Yes, I watch “Friends.” It is... very funny, and I learn English from it.
