Ah, yes! I have one. Last week, I go to... um, flower park with my friend.
It was very beautiful. Many sakura... um, cherry blossom. And also, many people come to see.
Yes, very special. We take many photos and eat... um, picnic? Under the tree.
Yes, peaceful. And... um, how to say... happy. I feel very happy.
We walk around park and see small shop. They sell... um, food like dango. It is sweet.
Yes! Rice dumpling with sweet sauce. It is very delicious.
I feel... um, thankful. Thankful for nature and friend. It was very... memorable.
Thank you. I think I will go again next year.
Thank you for listening. Um, I must go now. See you later!
You too! Goodbye!
