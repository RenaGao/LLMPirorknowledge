Ah, yes! I like... um, how to say... Japanese curry. It is very comfort food for me.
First, you need onion, carrot, potato, and... um, meat. I use pork, but chicken is also okay.
Yes, I cut them into small piece... pieces. Then, I fry meat in the pan until it is... um, brown color.
After that, I add vegetable and fry together. Then, I put water and... um, curry roux.
Yes, it is like... block of curry flavor. You can buy it in Japanese store.
About... 30 minutes? You wait until vegetable is soft and sauce is thick.
Yes, usually with rice. It is very good combination.
Of course! I can show you next time.
You’re welcome! I’m happy to talk about it.
See you later!
