Ah, hello! No, I not have plan yet. Why you ask?
Italian food? That sound good. But I not sure... is it expensive?
Um, I think... maybe not too much expensive. Perhaps we can find cheaper place?
Ah, sushi! Yes, I like that. It is feel more... um, comfortable for me.
Movie is good idea. But... what time is dinner?
Ah, I see. But I think movie is too late for me. Maybe we can... um... walk in park instead?
Yes, I like that plan. Sushi and walk in park is... um, very relaxing.
Letâ€™s meet there. I can... um... take bus to sushi place.
Yes, see you at seven. Thank you for making plan with me!
You too. Goodbye!
