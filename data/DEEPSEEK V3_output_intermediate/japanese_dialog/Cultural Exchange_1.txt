Oh, it was good! But... um, I noticed some, how to say... different ways of eating? In Japan, it’s very different.
Uh, in Japan, we use chopsticks mostly. But in U.S., fork and knife is common. It was little... strange for me at first.
Yes, but I still make mistake. Like, sometimes I drop food with fork. It feels... not natural.
In Japan, we share food sometimes. Like, small dishes in middle of table. But in U.S., everyone has... um, their own plate.
Ah, I see. Also, in Japan, we say “itadakimasu” before eating. It means... um, “I receive this food.” But in U.S., people don’t say anything.
Yes, and after eating in Japan, we say “gochisousama.” It’s like... thanking for the meal.
Ah, maybe! But in Japan, we say it to the cook or... um, the person who made the food.
Yes, I think so. Also, in U.S., people drink cold water with meal. In Japan, we drink hot tea or... um, warm water.
Yes, it was interesting to see. I learned a lot.
Ah, yes! That would be fun. Let’s do it!
Yes, see you soon!
