Ah, yes! We want to go to... um, San Francisco. It is city by sea, very famous.
We want to see Golden Gate Bridge. And... um, how to say... the house with many color?
Yes! Painted Ladies. Also, we want to eat... um, seafood.
Um, I think we use bus. But in Japan, subway is more easy. Maybe we try both?
We are thinking... um, hotel near center. But it is little expensive. Maybe we share room.
Four persons. We are very excited, but... um, I worry about time.
Yes. We have only three days. Is it enough?
I see. We will make list of places to go. And... um, any food we must try?
Clam chowder? Sounds interesting. I will tell my friends. Thank you for advice!
Next month. We book flight next week.
Yes, I will tell you after trip. Thank you for helping me plan!
Thank you! I will. See you later!
