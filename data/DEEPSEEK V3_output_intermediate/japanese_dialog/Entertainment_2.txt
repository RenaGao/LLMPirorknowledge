Ah, yes! I read... um... book called *The Alchemist*. It is very good.
It is story about... ah, how to say... person who go to find treasure. But also, it is about... um... finding meaning in life.
I think it is... um... inspiring. It teach you to follow your dream. Also, it is not too difficult to read.
Yes, yes! The words are simple and... um... the story make you think.
Hmm... my favorite is when the boy... um, main character... meet the alchemist. He teach him many wise thing.
Yes, it is! It is very... um... deep.
I hope you enjoy it! If you read, please tell me what you think.
You are welcome. It was nice talking with you.
Yes, thank you. You too. Goodbye!
