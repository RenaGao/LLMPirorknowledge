Ah, yes. Thank you. The software... it is difficult for me. I cannot find, um, how to save data.
File menu... yes, I see it. Then what I do?
Oh! Save As. I understand. But... um, where is good place to save it?
Okay, thank you. Desktop folder is good idea. I will try.
Yes, I think so. I save file now. But... another problem. Um, how to open it again?
Double-click... ah, I see. I try it. Yes, it works! Thank you very much.
Thatâ€™s kind. I will study more about the software before next time. Um, see you later!
