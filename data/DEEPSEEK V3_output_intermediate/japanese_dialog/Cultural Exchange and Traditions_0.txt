Ah, yes! In Japan, we have... um... festival called "Obon." It is very important.
It is time when... um, how to say... we remember family member who passed away.
Yes, exactly! We go to family grave and clean it. And we make... um, food offering.
Yes, we light lantern and put it outside house. It is to guide... um, spirits.
Oh, yes! There is dance called "Bon Odori." People wear yukata and dance in circle.
Yes, it is like... um, light kimono. Very comfortable for summer.
Yes, we eat... um, somen noodle. It is thin and cold. Very refreshing.
It depends on region. In my area, it is in August, around... um, middle of month.
Yes, I go to hometown every year. It is very important time for family.
Thank you for listening. I hope... um, one day you can see Obon in Japan.
You too! See you again soon!
Thank you! I will do my best. Goodbye!
