Um, I visit Osaka Castle, and also... Dotonbori. It is famous street, many food and light.
Yes, yes! I eat takoyaki. It is... um, ball with octopus. Very delicious!
Ah, yes! It was very lively. Many people, and the light is very bright. But... um, a little noisy.
Yes, I go to... um, aquarium. It has big whale shark. Very impressive.
I stay for three day. It was enough, I think.
Yes, I use subway many time. It is... um, easy to understand, but a little crowded.
