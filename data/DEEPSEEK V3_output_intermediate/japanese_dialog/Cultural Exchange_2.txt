Ah, yes! My favorite holiday is... um, how to say... New Year. It is called "Oshogatsu" in Japanese.
We eat special food called "osechi," and we visit temple to pray... um, for good luck in new year. And also, we spend time with family.
Yes! We watch... um... special TV program. It is funny and happy, and we stay up until midnight.
Yes, when I was child, my family go to temple together. It was very cold, but the air is... um... fresh. I remember it very well.
Ah, I like... um... black beans. They are sweet and... um... meaning good health. And also, fish cake. It is colorful and tasty.
Thank you for listen! If you come to Japan, I can show you more about it.
You too! Letâ€™s talk again soon!
