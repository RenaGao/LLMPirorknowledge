Ah, morning is good. I wake up early, around 6.30. Then, I... um, take shower and eat breakfast.
Usually I eat nasi lemak or bread with... uh, thing for spreading, like jam or butter.
Yes, I drink tea. Coffee sometime, but tea is more... uh, my favorite.
After, I... um, prepare for work. I wear clothes and check my... uh, bag to make sure nothing missing.
Yes, I take LRT. It is... uh, train for going to office. Sometimes it is crowded.
Around 30 minute. But if traffic, maybe 45. I always try to leave early.
Ah, yes. If I have time, I read news or listen music. But not too much.
No problem. You also have busy morning?
Okay, thank you! Have a nice day too!
