I’m doing good, thank you. How about you?
That sounds very nice! I also want to go out. Where we can go?
Hmm, I like that place, uh, how to say… near the park? They have good nasi lemak.
Maybe at 7 p.m.? Is okay for you?
Yes, maybe we can go for… um, what you call it… walk around?
Yes, I like walk in park. It’s very peaceful.
Oh, I like that! Maybe we can eat… uh, ais kacang?
Yes, it is very nice. So, we meet at 7 p.m. for dinner, then walk, then eat ais kacang?
Yes, I very excited! Thank you for planning.
Okay, see you on Saturday! Bye!
