Ah, yes! In Malaysia, we usually eat with hand. But only the right hand, because left hand is... um, how to say... not clean?
Yes, very impolite. Also, we must wash hand before eat. Very important.
Yes, we share food. Like, many dishes in middle, and everyone take with spoon or hand. But no use our own spoon to take from big plate—must use serving spoon.
Hmm, it is polite to finish food. But if you full, it’s okay to leave a little. But better to take small portion first, then take more if you want.
Yes, we always have drink like water or tea. But we don’t drink during eat—it is better to drink after eating.
I think it help digestion. Also, it’s polite to pour drink for others before yourself.
Ah, yes. Don’t put your hand in the rice bowl—it look like disrespect. And must wait for older person to start eating first.
Yes, every culture have different way. I like to learn Western dining custom too.
You’re welcome! Happy to share. Next time, I can teach you how to eat with hand.
See you later! Thank you for listening.
Sure, I will look forward to it. Have a good day!
