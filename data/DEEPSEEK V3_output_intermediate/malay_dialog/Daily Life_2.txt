Ah, yes! I like cook nasi lemak. It is... um, Malay food. Very famous in my country.
It is rice. Cook with... uh, coconut milk. And have sambal chili, cucumber, fried egg, and... um, anchovies.
First, you wash rice. Then, you cook with coconut milk, and... uh, little bit salt. Also, you put pandan leaf for smell.
It is green leaf. Very nice smell. We use often in cooking.
Yes, very spicy! You fry chili, onion, garlic, and... um, shrimp paste. Mix all together.
Maybe... um, the shrimp paste. It is... uh, how to say, belacan. But other things easy to find.
Very simple. Just fry egg like usual. And anchovies, you fry until crispy.
Yes, good idea! I can show you step by step.
Yes, I write down what we need. Rice, coconut milk, pandan leaf, chili, onion, garlic, shrimp paste, egg, and anchovies.
Thank you! I sure you will like nasi lemak.
Okay, we cook together on Saturday. See you then!
