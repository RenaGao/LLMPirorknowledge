Oh, surprise party for Aiman? That is... um, very good idea! I think we can make it at his house. Or maybe... um, in restaurant?
Ah, I think we can use balloons and... um, that thing for party... uh, banner? Yes, banner with his name.
Hmm, Aiman like nasi lemak very much. We can order from... um, the shop near his house. And maybe cake also.
Yes, I think so. Maybe... um, 10 people? Not too many, but enough for fun.
Oh, yes! We can play that game where you guess the song. Aiman like music very much.
Aiman usually come home at 6 p.m. So maybe 5 p.m. for us to prepare?
I think... um, maybe we can buy him new shoes. His old ones... uh, already break.
I think... um, music? We can make a playlist with his favorite songs.
Yes, that is all. I think Aiman will be very happy.
Yes, thank you too. I will see you next week. Bye!
