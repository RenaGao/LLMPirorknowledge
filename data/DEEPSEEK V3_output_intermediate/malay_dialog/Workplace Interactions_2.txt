Yes, please. I want to learn... um, how to do it.
Okay, I understand. But if I donâ€™t know the answer, what to do?
Ah, I see. And if the customer is angry? How to handle?
Okay, I will try. Sometimes I worry my English is not so good.
Thank you. This is very helpful. I will practice.
Yes, thank you. I feel more confident now. See you later!
