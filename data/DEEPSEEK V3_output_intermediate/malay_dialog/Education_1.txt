Ah, thank you. Um, I know a little bit, but it is... how to say... confusing for me.
I think... the thing about carbon, um, carbon dioxide? How it makes the Earth become hotter.
Global warming, yes. But why is carbon dioxide increasing? From where it come?
Oh, I see. So, cars and factories make the gas, and then the gas make the Earth hotter. But how to stop it?
Solar and wind... okay. But I think it is difficult for many people to change, yes?
Plant trees? Why trees important?
Oh, I understand now. Trees are like... natural cleaner for the air. That is good to know.
Yes, much more clear. Thank you for explaining. I will try to do small things to help.
Thank you also. I hope we can talk more next time.
See you later, and thank you again!
