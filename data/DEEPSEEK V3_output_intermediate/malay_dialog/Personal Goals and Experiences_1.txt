Ah, yes. I want to learn how to cook. It is... important for me because I need to take care of myself.
I want to learn Malay dish, like nasi lemak and rendang. But also... um, how to say... international food?
Yes, yes! Italian pizza and Japanese sushi. I think it is good to know many food.
A little bit. I know how to fry egg and cook rice. But I never try more difficult dish.
My mother, she is good cook. But she is far away now. So I think I will... um, learn from video on internet.
Maybe next week. I already bought some... um, ingredient... for nasi lemak.
Yes, I hope so. And also, it is cheaper than eating outside.
Yes, health is important. I think I will feel more... um, confident if I can cook well.
Thank you! I will try my best.
Yes, I will. Thank you again. Bye!
