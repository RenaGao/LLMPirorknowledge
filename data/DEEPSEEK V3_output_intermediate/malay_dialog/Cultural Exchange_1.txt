Ah, yes! In Malaysia, we always eat with our right hand. Left hand is... um, how to say... not polite.
In my culture, left hand is for... um, cleaning, not for eating. So right hand is better. And also, we must not point our feet to the food or people. It is rude.
Yes, we share food! Always. Everyone sit together and take food from same plate. It is... how to say... bonding time.
Ah, yes. When guest come, we always offer food and drink. If not, it is... um, not good. Guest must feel welcome.
Oh, yes. If we eat rice with curry, we use spoon and fork. But for some food like nasi lemak, we use hand. It is more... um, authentic.
No, no. We must finish food. If not, it mean we don’t like it. And that is... um, not good. Host may feel sad.
Tipping? Not common in Malaysia. But some place, like tourist area, they accept. But we don’t worry so much for tipping.
You are welcome! It is... um, nice for me to explain my culture.
Sure! See you next time. Have a good day!
