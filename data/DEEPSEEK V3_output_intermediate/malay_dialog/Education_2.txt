Ah, yes, teacher. I can talk now. What is the... um, problem?
Oh, question three. It is about... how to say... the thing for making water clean.
Yes, yes! Water purification. You need to explain the... um, steps. The steps to clean the water.
Yes, teacher. But not too long. Just... the important steps. Like, first, you take the dirt out. Then, you add... um, chemical?
Yes, that’s it. You understand now?
Not too long. Maybe... one page? But focus on the main steps. Is that okay?
You’re welcome, teacher. If you have more questions, just ask.
You too, teacher. See you in class tomorrow!
