Oh, ah… next year I want to improve my English. Because, um, I need it for my work.
I think… I will join English class. And also, I try to speak more with English-speaking friend, like you.
Yes, I want also to save money. For… um, how to say… something for future.
Yes, travel! I want to visit Japan. I hear it is very nice place.
I will… um, reduce spend money on unnecessary thing. Like eating out too much. And I also put some money in bank every month.
I think… sometimes it is difficult to stay motivated. Especially when work is busy.
Ah, yes, that is good idea. I will try to do that.
Thank you. Your words make me feel more confident.
Yes, I hope to improve English in six month. And for saving money, I aim to have enough for Japan trip by end of next year.
Thank you. Your support… um, how to say… make me feel happy.
Yes, that is good idea. Thank you for listening to me.
Okay, I will see you next month. Goodbye!
