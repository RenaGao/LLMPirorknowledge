Yes, I am. I think I need some help to understand the photosynthesis topic.
Chlorophyll? Hmm, is it something that... um, makes the plant green color?
Yes, I think so. But how the sunlight change into... um, food for the plant?
Oh, I see. So, sunlight give energy, and then... uh, the plant make glucose. What happen to the oxygen?
Ah, I understand now. So, plant take in... um, water and sunlight, and give out oxygen. Like a kind of... factory?
Yes, thank you. Your explanation is very clear. I think I can answer the questions in the book now.
Thank you so much. I will try my best. See you in class later!
