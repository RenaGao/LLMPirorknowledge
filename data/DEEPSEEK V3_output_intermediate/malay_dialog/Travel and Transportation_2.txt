Oh, hello! Yes, I think about it. Maybe we can go to island? I hear about Langkawi. Very beautiful.
Um, we can do... like, swim in sea. And also, there is cable car, for see the view. Very nice.
Yes, I think so. Also, there is shopping place. My friend say it is cheap and good to buy... um, thing for memory?
Ah, yes! Souvenirs. I think it is good for everyone.
Oh, the food is... um, how to say... very delicious! Seafood, especially. We must try.
Maybe four days? Enough to see everything and relax.
I think hotel is better. More easy for all of us.
Good idea! Thank you for help.
Yes, sure. I will ask the group for their opinion too.
See you soon! We will have a fun vacation, I think.
