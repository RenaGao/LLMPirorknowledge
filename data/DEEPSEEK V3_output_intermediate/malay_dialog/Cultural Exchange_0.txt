Ah, yes. In Malaysia, we have many festival, but one very popular is Hari Raya Aidilfitri. It is after Ramadan, the fasting month.
Yes, exactly! We celebrate after one month fasting. It is very big and happy time.
Um, we wear new clothes, usually traditional one called baju kurung or baju Melayu. And we visit family and friends.
Yes, we open house. We prepare many food, like ketupat, rendang, and lemang. Everyone is welcome to eat.
I like the... um, how to say... the togetherness. Everyone is happy, and we forgive each other for past mistakes.
Yes, exactly. Also, we give money to children in small packet called duit raya. They like it very much!
Yes, we put up oil lamp called pelita and decorate house with lights. Sometimes, there is also cultural performance, like music and dance.

You too, goodbye!
