Hi! Ah, not yet. I... I have many other thing to do. Math is difficult for me.
Oh, thatâ€™s good idea! I like study with friend. But I not sure how to... um, organize study time.
Yes, can. Tomorrow after class is okay. Um, what topic we will study?
Algebra? Ah, I forget many thing about algebra. Maybe I need to... uh, review again.
Okay, thank you. I feel... um, more confident if I have friend to help.
My way is... um, I write note. And then, I read many time. But sometimes I forget.
Oh, practice question? I think that is good idea. I will try.
Yes, library is okay. I will bring my note and... um, my calculator.
Yes, we must try. Thank you for help. I feel better now.
See you tomorrow! Goodbye!
