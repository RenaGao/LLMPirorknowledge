Yes, sir. Thank you for meeting. I want... um, to be more healthy.
I like walking. Sometimes, I go to gym, but... um, how to say... not often.
Twice a week? Hmm, I think... can try. But I worry about time.
Yes, 30 minutes... I think can do. What exercise I should do there?
Treadmill is easy. But weights... I afraid I do wrong.
Oh, thank you! That make me feel... um, better.
I want to lose... um, how to say... weight? And also have more... energy.
Diet? I think I need to eat more... healthy food.
I will try. Thank you for your advice.
Yes, thank you. See you next week!
