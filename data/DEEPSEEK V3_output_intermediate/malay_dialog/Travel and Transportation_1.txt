I walk. It is okay if not too far.

Big bookstore on the... uh, right? Then hotel is behind?
Thank you so much! Uh, is it safe to walk there?
Shortcut? Where?
Small park... okay, I try that. Thank you again!
Ah, yes, please. That would be... um, very helpful.
Thank you so much. You are very kind.
Yes, I will. Thank you and good day!
