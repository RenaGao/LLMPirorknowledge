Ah, ya. I think the problem is... um, we have many task but not enough time. Maybe we can... how to say... divide the work?
I can do the... data thing. The, uh, collecting and checking data. But I need help with the report writing.
Can we make first deadline... um, next Tuesday? I need time to check everything.
Yes, thatâ€™s good idea. I think we can do like this.
Thank you! I will ask if I have any... um, difficulties.
Ah, yes, we should tell them. Maybe we can send email?
Okay, thank you. I think this plan will work.
Yes, tomorrow we start. Thank you for helping me.
Yes, have a nice evening too. See you on Monday!
Goodbye, see you soon!
