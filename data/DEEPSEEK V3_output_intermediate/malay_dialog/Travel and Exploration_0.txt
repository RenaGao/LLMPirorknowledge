Ah, yes! We want go to Penang. Many friends say it is very... um, how to say... interesting place.
Yes, very excited! We plan to visit... um, many famous... how to say... places? Like temples and beaches.
We think stay in Georgetown. It is... um, central and easy to go everywhere.
We will take bus. It is... um, cheaper than fly.
Three days. Friday to Sunday. Is that enough?
First, we want to eat! Penang food is... um, very famous. Like... char kuey teow.
Maybe visit Kek Lok Si temple and... um, how to say... ride bicycle at Penang Hill.
Yes, we decide each person bring RM500. For food, stay, and... um, transport.
Thank you! I hope everything will be... um, smooth.
Ah, yes! Good idea. I will check it. Thank you for your advice!
Thank you! I will tell you about it when I come back. Goodbye!
