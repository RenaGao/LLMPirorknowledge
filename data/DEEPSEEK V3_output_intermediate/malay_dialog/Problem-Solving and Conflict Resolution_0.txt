Uh, yes, I got your message. But actually, I feel a bit... uh, how to say... confused. I thought we agreed to meet.
Ah, maybe I miss it. I check phone later, but I see nothing. So I wait for you, but you not come.
Itâ€™s okay. I just feel... um, sad because I think you forget me.
Yes, I understand now. Maybe next time, we can confirm... um, double-check?
Thank you. It will make me feel... uh, more sure.
That sounds good. I am free on Saturday.
Yes, noon is okay. I will be there.
No problem. I am happy we talk and clear this... uh, misunderstanding.
Yes, see you on Saturday. Have a good day!
