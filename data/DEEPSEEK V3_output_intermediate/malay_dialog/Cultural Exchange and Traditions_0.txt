**[MSL] Speaker B: Second-Language Speaker, Malay**
Ah, yes, sure! I can tell you about one festival... um, it is called Hari Raya Aidilfitri.
It is festival for celebrate the end of fasting month, Ramadan. After one month not eat and drink during day, we have big celebration with family and friends.
Yes, like reunion. We wear new clothes, visit family house, and eat many traditional food like ketupat and rendang.
Ketupat is rice cooked in... um, how to say... leaf packet? And rendang is spicy meat, very delicious.
Yes, we give money in small envelope, called “duit raya,” to children. And also, we ask forgiveness from family and friends. It is important to start fresh.
Yes, we put up colorful lamps and... um, banners. Also, mosque is very busy because many people go for prayer.
My favorite part is when all family come together. We eat, talk, and... um, enjoy time. It make me happy.
You are welcome. If you come to Malaysia during Hari Raya, I will invite you to my house.
Okay, then we make plan. Thank you for listen. See you soon!
