Hello, thank you, Sarah. Iâ€™m Hafiz. Nice to meet you. Okay, I ready to hear the task.
Shared drive? Is it the... um, folder for everyone to use?
Oh, I see. So, I need to arrange the files? How to do it?
Ah, okay. So, client name for folder, and all their paper inside?
I understand. But, um, if there are many files, how to know which one belong to who?
Okay, got it. I will try to do it. If I have problem, I will ask you.
Thank you, Sarah. I feel more confident now. When is the... um, when must I finish?
Yes, tomorrow is enough, I think. I will try my best.
Okay, Sarah. Thank you for explaining very clear. I will start now.
Thank you, Sarah. You too, have a nice day!
Goodbye, Sarah! See you tomorrow.
Thank you, I will do my best. See you again!
