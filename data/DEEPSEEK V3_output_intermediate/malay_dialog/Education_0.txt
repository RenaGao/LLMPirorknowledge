Ah, hello! My preparation... um, it’s okay, but I feel a bit worried. There is so many thing to study.
I worry for math. The formula is very... how to say... complicated. And also, history. Too many date to remember.
Yes, I try. But sometimes I cannot understand the question. Maybe I need more practice.
Oh, that’s... um, sounds good. I will try. Thank you for the suggestion.
Ah, my friend Aiman and I sometimes study together. But he also busy with his own study.
Yes, we share note. But I think I need more time to... uh, review everything.
Okay, I will make schedule. Thank you for your advice. It makes me feel better.
Yes, I will try my best. If I have problem again, can I ask you?
Thank you very much. Good luck for you also! I will see you later.
