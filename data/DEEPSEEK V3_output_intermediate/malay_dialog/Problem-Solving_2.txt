Um, yes… but I want to say sorry, Mr. John. I make mistake with the report.
The numbers, they are not correct. I… how to say… I mix up the data.
Yes, I think because I hurry too much. I not check properly before send.
Yes, I already correct the numbers. And now I double-check everything before send.
Thank you, Mr. John. I feel very sorry about this.
Yes, I will. I promise to be more careful.
Um, no, I think that’s all. Thank you for understanding, Mr. John.
Yes, I will. Thank you again, Mr. John. Have a good day!
Okay, see you later!
