Ah, yes, I have one. It is called... *The Kite Runner*. You know this book?
It is about... um, how to say... two boys in Afghanistan. Their friendship, and... ah, the difficult things they face.
Because the story is very... touching. It make you feel many emotion. I cry when I read it.
Um, not so difficult. The words are clear, but the story is deep. I think you can understand it well.
Yes, I learn about... how to say... the importance of friends and family. And also, how life can change very fast.
Youâ€™re welcome! I hope you like it.
Um, I think you can find in bookstore. But online also many people sell it. Maybe cheaper.
Good idea. Let me know if you read it, okay?
No problem. Enjoy reading!
Yes, see you!
