Hi! I’m good, thank you. And you?
Ah, my favorite movie is... um... how to say... “Fast and Furious.” I like it because it’s... exciting and have many action.
I think... part 7? Because... it’s very touching. You know, the ending about Paul Walker.
Yes, I like action, but also sometimes... um... romantic movie? Like, “Crazy Rich Asian.” It’s... funny and nice story.
Ah, yes! I like... uhh... “Breaking Bad.” The story is very... intense. And the acting is... um... very good.
Hmm... I also watch “Money Heist.” It’s... very exciting and have many... uh... plot twists.
I like to watch with friends, because we can... um... discuss the story after. But sometimes, I watch alone if the show is... serious.
Yes, I think you will like it! It’s... very interesting and keep you... um... thinking.
You’re welcome! And thank you also for talk about movies.
Yes, sure! Nice to talk with you. See you later!
