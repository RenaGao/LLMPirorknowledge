Ah, hello. The report is almost finish. I need to check some data... um, how to say, to make sure it is correct.
Not big issue, but I need more time for, uh... the detail part. Maybe one more day?
Yes, yes, enough. I will make sure it is ready before Friday.
Not yet. I focus on report first. But I will start the slides tomorrow.
Thank you. Maybe I need help with... um, the design? I not so good with that.
Okay, I will send it to you once I finish.
I think thatâ€™s all for now. I keep working on the report and slides.
Yes, sure. See you tomorrow. Thank you for your help.
You too. See you later!
Bye!
