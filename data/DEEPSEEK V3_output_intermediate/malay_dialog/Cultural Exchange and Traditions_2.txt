Oh, thank you. I am very happy to share. I think we can make event about food and... um, traditional dance.
Maybe we can have nasi lemak... it is our popular rice dish. And also, satayâ€”it is meat on stick, very delicious.
We can show zapin dance. It is traditional dance for Malay people. Very beautiful and... um, how to say... energetic.
Maybe in community hall? It is big enough for dance and food.
Yes, good idea. We can invite many people to... um, how to say... learn about our culture.
We can use social media... like Facebook and Instagram. And also, maybe posters in... uh, public places.
Yes, maybe theme is "Malay Heritage Day." It is... um, easy to understand for everyone.
Maybe on Saturday, 20th November. It is near to Hari Raya... um, our festival.
Yes, we need people to help with food, dance, and also... um, decorating the hall.
Yes, next week is good for me. I will prepare more ideas.
Thank you too! See you next week, and we will make a great event.
