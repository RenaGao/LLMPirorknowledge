Oh, yes! My favorite holiday is... um, how to say... Hari Raya Aidilfitri.
It is after Ramadan, the fasting month. We celebrate with family and... uh, how to say... open house.
Yes, yes! We invite friends, family, even neighbor. We cook many food and... um... wear traditional clothes.
Oh, we have ketupat, rendang, and lemang. Ketupat is rice in coconut leaf, rendang is... um, spicy meat, and lemang is rice in bamboo.
Yes, we give money to children. It is called... um, duit raya. And we ask forgiveness from each other.
Yes, everywhere! But in my hometown, it is... um... more special because many family stay together.
You must come! We will prepare many food for you.
You’re welcome! Next time, I will tell you more about other holiday.
Thank you! You too. Have a nice day!
See you later! Let’s continue next time.
