It’s okay. Busy with work. But I feel, um, sometimes tired.
Not so much. I don’t have time, always working.
Ah, yes. Like what?
Sometimes, but not much. Always eat fast food. Very easy and quick.
Hmm, maybe I can try. But I don’t know how to... cook well.
Yes, please. That is helpful.
Ah, walk is okay for me. I will try to walk more in the... evening.
Um, maybe 5 or 6. Always wake up early and sleep late.
I will try. Thank you for your advice. It is very... how to say... useful.
Okay. Yes, I will... um, follow your advice. Thank you again!
You too. Bye!
Speaker A and Speaker B conclude the conversation with a friendly goodbye and a summary of their agreement.
