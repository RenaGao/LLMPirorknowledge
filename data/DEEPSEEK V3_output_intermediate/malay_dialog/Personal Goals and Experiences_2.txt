Hi! I am good, thank you. How about you?
Ah, yes! Actually, I... um, finish my English course last month.
It take... um, six month. I study every week, but it is... um, what is the word... ah, challenging!
I think... grammar is hard. Sometimes I say, “He have” instead of “He has.”
It mean... um, I have more confident now. I can talk to people in English. Before, I always... how to say... afraid to make mistake.
I want to... um, practice more. Maybe join English club or watch more English movie.
I like “The Avengers.” The story is... um, exciting, and the English is not too fast.
Just... thank you for listening. I feel happy to share with you.
Thank you! I will try my best.
Yes, I hope so. Goodbye!
