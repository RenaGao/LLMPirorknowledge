Ah, yes! I want share Korean... um, traditions with friends. Like food, clothes, and maybe music.
I think... bibimbap and kimchi. Very famous in Korea. And maybe tteokbokki? It is... spicy rice cake.
Maybe I cook some, but also... um, how to say... ask friends to help. It is lot of work.
Yes! Maybe show hanbok. It is traditional dress. Very beautiful.
Of course! K-pop is very popular. Maybe play BTS or Blackpink song.
I think... next month. I need time to prepare.
Maybe in community center. It is big and have many space.
Thank you! Maybe help with... um, decorations? Like Korean flag or lantern.
Thank you so much! I will tell you soon.
Me too. I hope everyone enjoy and learn... um, learn about Korea.
Thank you! See you next time.
Bye! Have a good day.
Yes, letâ€™s talk again soon. Goodbye!
