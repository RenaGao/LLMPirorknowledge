Oh, yes, we should go! Maybe... um, to Jeju Island? It is very beautiful.
We can climb Hallasan mountain. Also, Jeju have... um, how to say... caves? And many beaches.
Yes, we can rent car. Or, um, take bus. Bus is... cheap, but car is more easy.
Maybe four day? Not too short, not too long.
We can stay in... um, pension? It is like small house. Very comfortable and cheap.
Yes, better to book early. Jeju is... um, popular for tourist.
Spring or autumn. Weather is... um, nice. Not too hot, not too cold.
Yes, April is good. Flowers are... um, blooming. Very pretty.
Yes, I will tell them. Thank you for... um, planning with me.
Yes, see you later. Bye!
