Ah, yes, thank you. I am looking for... um, the big park. Central Park? How to go there?
I walk, please. Is it... um, easy to find?
Turn left... at the light. Okay, I understand. And after that?
Oh, thank you! So, straight, left, and then... right?
No, no, it’s okay. I think I can remember. Um, how long is the walking time?
Ah, 10 minute. That’s good. Thank you so much for your help.
Yes, I will. And... um, goodbye!
