Hello! I’m fine, thank you. But I have something to say. It is... um, maybe problem.
I... I make mistake. I forget to send email to client. Now they are waiting.
It should be sent yesterday. I am very sorry for this mistake.
Yes, I send email just now. But I worry they will be angry.
Yes, I will say sorry. And also... I will offer something to make up. Maybe discount for next order?
Ah, yes. I hope they understand. I don’t want to lose them as client.
Thank you for advice. I feel a little better now.
Yes, I will. If you can check my email, I will be very thankful.
Okay, I will do my best. Thank you again.
You too. Goodbye!
