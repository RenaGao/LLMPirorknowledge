Ah, yes. Um… I think maybe misunderstanding happen. I said, “I cannot go *this* Friday,” but I can go *next* Friday.
Yes, yes! This Friday, I have… um… family dinner. So I cannot go. But next Friday, I am free.
Yes, next Friday is good. Sorry for confusion.
Yes, same movie. What time we meet?
Ah, dinner also? Okay, that sounds good. 7 p.m. is okay for me.
Yes, usual place is good. Um… near the station, right?
Okay, thank you for… um… understanding. Sorry again for confusion.
Yes, see you next Friday! Have a good day.
