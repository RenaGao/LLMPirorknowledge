Ah, the exam... I think I need more study. I feel little nervous.
Um, the math problem... especially the one with, uh, how to say... the thing with shapes?
Yes, geometry! It is very hard for me. I try many time, but still confused.
Really? That will be great! Thank you so much. When we can meet?
Yes, 4 p.m. is good for me. Where we meet?
Library is good idea. I bring my... uh, note... notes and book.
Thank you very much. I feel little better now.
Okay! I will do my best.
Yes, see you tomorrow! Thank you again.
