Ah, yes, I have time. The problem is... um, about geometry, right?
I think so. Formula is... um, base... times height, then divide by two?
Oh, I see. So, we need to find height first?
Um... I think I know. It is for triangle, right? A squared plus B squared equal to C squared?
Oh, yes. Drawing is helpful. So, we need to find this side... um, like this?
Ah, okay. So, we can use Pythagorean theorem to find “h”?
Yes, I think so. But, um, I am little confused about how to start.
Okay, I try. Base is 10, and this side is 6... and this side is 8?
Oh, I see now! So, it is 6 squared plus h squared equal to 8 squared?
Um... 36 plus h squared equal to 64. So, h squared is 28?
Yes! Now we can find area. Base is 10, height is square root of 28, then divide by two.
Thank you so much for explaining. Now I understand better.
I will. Thank you again. See you in class tomorrow!
Yes, you too. Bye!
