Oh, yes! I think we... um, make party at his house? Maybe when he is not there.
His sister say he go... um, go to gym at Saturday afternoon. So we can do then.
Uh... balloons? And also, we can make banner? Like, “Happy Birthday Hyunwoo!”
Hyunwoo like... uh, Korean food. Maybe we order kimchi jjigae and samgyeopsal?
I know one place. They deliver fast. I will call them before party.
Yes! He always talk about new... um, thing for listening music? Headphones!
Okay! I will buy it online. They have discount now.
Maybe his close friends? Like, Jisoo and Minho? They can come too.
How about... 2 PM? We can prepare before he come back.
Yes, we can check then. Thank you for help!
See you! Bye!
