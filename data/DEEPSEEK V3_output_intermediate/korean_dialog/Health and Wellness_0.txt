Ah, yes, thank you. I feel... um, not good. I have headache and... my body is hot.
Three day... no, three days.
Yes, I take... um, thing for pain. Like... pill?
Yes, painkillers. But not working. Only little better.
Ah, yes! My throat is... um, hurt. And sometimes, my nose is... uh, blocked.
Cold or flu? But... I feel very tired. No energy.
Um, not much. I have... work. Many thing to do.
Thank you, doctor. Um... how long? When I feel better?
Ah, I see. Thank you, doctor. I will... um, try rest more.
Yes, I will. Thank you, doctor. Goodbye!
