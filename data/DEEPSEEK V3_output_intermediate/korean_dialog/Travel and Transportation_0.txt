Yes, yes! I go to Busan last weekend. It was... um, very good experience.
I visit Gwangalli Beach and eat a lot of seafood. Also, I go to Gamcheon Culture Village. It was... colorful and many photo spots.
Yes, I take many photos! But, um, I forgot bring my good camera, so I use phone. Still, it was nice.
Weather was... sunny but windy. Perfect for walking around. I like it much.
Yes, I eat... uh, hoe? Raw fish dish. And also ssiat hotteok. It is sweet pancake, very famous in Busan.
Yes, it was fresh and delicious. But, um, first time eating raw fish, so I feel little nervous.
I also go to Jagalchi Market. There are many fish and people. Very lively place.
I buy small ocean things... um, souvenirs? For my family. They like it.
Oh, yes! Busan is very beautiful and have many things to do. Food is also great. I will go again.
Thank you for listening! Next time, we go together?
Okay! Iâ€™m looking forward to it. Goodbye!
