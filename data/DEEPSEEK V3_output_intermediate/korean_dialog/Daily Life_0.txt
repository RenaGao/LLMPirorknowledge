Ah, hello! My morning routine... um, I wake up at 7 o’clock. Then, I brush my teeth and wash my face. Simple, I think.
Yes, but sometimes... um, how to say... I skip breakfast? Because I late, you know?
Hmm, I like eat rice and... um, something with soup? Like Korean soup. It is good for morning.
Coffee... um, yes, I drink it sometimes. But not every day. It make me too awake, I think.
Ah, exercise... um, I try to walk few minute outside. Fresh air is good, I think. But not long, maybe 10 minute.
Yes! I listen music. Um, I like K-pop song. It make me happy.
Uh... I like BTS and... um, Blackpink. Their song is very fun.
Yes, I start study at 9 o’clock. I am student, so I have many things to do.
Early morning is good! You feel more... um, productive, I think.
You’re welcome! It was nice talking with you.
Yes, let’s meet again! Have a good day!
