Ah, yes! Thank you for asking. I passed... um, difficult test. It is called IELTS.
It was very... um, how to say... challenging. I study many months, every day.
Writing part. It is hard because I need to think logic... logic-al-ly. And vocabulary is not enough, sometimes.
I practice writing every day. And teacher help me, give feedback. Also, I read many English book.
I feel very proud. It is important for me because I want study abroad. Now I can apply to university.
I want study... um, international business. It is my dream.
I apply to university in Canada. I like their program, and people are very kind.
Yes, it teach me that hard work is important. Even if it is difficult, never give up.
Thank you so much. I appreciate your help... um, your words.
Thank you. I will do my best!
Yes, see you around!
