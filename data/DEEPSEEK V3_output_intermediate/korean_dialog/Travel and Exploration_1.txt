Ah, yes! My favorite place is Namsan Tower in Seoul. It is... um, how to say... very beautiful.
I like the view. From the top, you can see all Seoul. And, um... many people put love locks there.
It is... um, small locks. Couple write their name and put on fence. It means their love... no break.
Ah, no, not yet. But maybe... in future? Haha.
Yes, I go there with friends. We take photo and, um... eat street food.
Ah... tteokbokki, hotteok, and... um, how to say... fried thing on stick?
Yes! Skewers. Very delicious.
Yes, you can take bus or... um, walk up the mountain. It is good exercise.
Thank you! If you come, I can... um, show you around.
Youâ€™re welcome. Have a nice day!
Goodbye! See you later!
