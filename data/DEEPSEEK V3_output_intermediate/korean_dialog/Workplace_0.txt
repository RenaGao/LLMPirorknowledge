Ah, yes. Please, I am here. What is the problem?
Um, next Friday... I think maybe I can finish. But if possible, I need... uh, two more day?
The data analysis part take more time than I think. And also, the... how to say... graph-making? It is hard for me.
Really? Thank you, thank you! That will be... um, very helpful.
Yes, Wednesday is good. What time... um, what time is best for you?
3 p.m. is okay. I will prepare data until then.
I will. Thank you so much for understand my... um, my situation.
Yes, team is important. I feel better now.
Okay. See you on Wednesday, then. Thank you again!
You too! Goodbye, and see you soon.
