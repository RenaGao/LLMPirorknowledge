Ah, yes! I have... um, plan with my friend. We go to Han River.
We ride... um, ride bicycle? And eat chicken.
Yes, yes! Han River is very beautiful now. Weather is, um, very good.
Near Han River Park has... um, place for rent bicycle.
We meet at... um, 11 in morning.
Yes, I think so. My friend also like this time.
Um, maybe... I think we stay until afternoon. Then go home.
Yes, thank you! I hope too.
Thank you so much! I will tell you about it next week.
Yes, see you later! Have good day!
