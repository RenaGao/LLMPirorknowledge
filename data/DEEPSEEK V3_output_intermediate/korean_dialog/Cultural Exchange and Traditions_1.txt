Ah, yes! In Korea, eating is... um, very important culture. We have many rules. For example, we cannot... uh, how to say... hold rice bowl with hand.
Yes, yes! It is... um, not polite. Also, we must wait for oldest person to start eating first.
Yes, respect is very important. And... um, we should not... uh, make sound with chopsticks.
Yes, and also... um, we cannot stick chopsticks in rice. It look like... how to say... funeral ceremony.
Ah, yes! When someone give you food or drink, you must... uh, use both hands. It show respect.
Oh, really? In Korea, not saying thank you is... um, very rude. We always say “kamsahamnida.” And also, we must finish all food in bowl.
It mean... um, host is not good cook. Or you are... how to say... not thankful.
Ah, I see. Very different! In Korea, we always try to finish.
