Hi, um, I’m good, thank you. And you?
Ah, yes. I think I not sleep enough. Busy with work... and study.
Yes, I know. But it’s hard to finish work early. How to say... I have many deadline.
That is good idea. I will try. But also, um, I feel tired even if I sleep. How to say... like, not good sleep.
Bedtime routine? Ah, no. I just... um, go to bed when tired.
Reading book is good idea. I like it. I will try. But also, um, exercise is important, right?
No... I want to exercise, but I don’t have time. How to say... work is very busy.
Yes, small start is good. I will try walking. And also, um, eating is important too, right?
Sometimes... I skip meal. Especially breakfast. I’m too busy in morning.
Ah, yes. Preparing is good idea. I will try. Thank you for the advice!
Yes, thank you. I will try and tell you next time. Goodbye!
