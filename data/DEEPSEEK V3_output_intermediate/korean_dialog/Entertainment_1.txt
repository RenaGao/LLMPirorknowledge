Ah, I like many kind of movies. But most... um, I enjoy romantic movie. Also, sometimes action.
Yes! I like very much "The Notebook." It is... how to say... make me cry every time.
Hmm, action movies... I think "Mission Impossible" is exciting. Tom Cruise is... um, he is amazing actor.
Yes, I see it last month. The stunts... um, how to say... very, very dangerous. I think impossible to do it!
Yes! I like TV show more than movie sometimes. I watch... um, "Stranger Things" recently. It is very interesting.
Really? Me too! I hope it come soon. Also, I like Korean drama very much.
Yes, I think "Crash Landing on You" is very good. It has romance, comedy, and... uh, some sad part too.
You’re welcome! I think you will like it.
Yes, I enjoy it too. Let’s talk again soon. Thank you!
You too! Goodbye!
