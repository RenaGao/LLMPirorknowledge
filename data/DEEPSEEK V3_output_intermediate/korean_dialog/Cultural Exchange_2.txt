Oh, it was very nice! But, um... I feel some surprise about eating culture.
In Korea, we... how to say... always share food. But in New York, everyone eat alone. It feels... strange for me.
Yes, yes! We order many dish and put in middle. Then everyone eat together. Also, we wait for older person to start first. It is... uh, respect.
Ah, yes. In Korea, we don’t leave food behind. My American friend... he leave half of pizza. It was... um, feeling waste.
Yes, very polite. If you leave food, it means... not enjoy the meal. In Korea, we say “eat well” before start. It is... um, kind of greeting.
Ah, I see. And also, in Korea, we use... um, metal chopsticks. In America, I see only wood chopsticks. It was hard for me at first.
Yes, because I use since young. But in New York, I use fork and knife... um, not comfortable for me.
Ah, one more thing. In Korea, we don’t give tip. But in America, we must give tip. It was... um, small confusion for me.
Yes, I think so. But I like learning new culture. It is... good experience.
Thank you for listen! It was nice to talk about my trip.
Yes, see you next time. Goodbye!
