Ah, yes. I feel... um, sad? Because I think you don’t want me to join.
Ah, I see. I was busy, but I want to join if possible.
Yes, that sounds good. I like to travel with you.
Okay. I will check my schedule and tell you.
Yes, thank you. I feel better now. Let’s plan soon!
Okay. Goodbye, and see you next time!
