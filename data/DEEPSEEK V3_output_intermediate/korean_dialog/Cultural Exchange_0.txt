Ah, yes! In Korea, we have Chuseok. It is very important holiday. Family... um, gather together and eat food.
We eat songpyeon. It is rice cake, um... small and half-moon shape. Inside, there is sweet thing like sesame or honey.
We give... ah, how to say... gift to family. Like fruit or meat. And we also do... um, bowing to ancestor. It is called “charye.”
Yes. We prepare table with food and bow to show respect. We thank them for... um, making our life now.
Sometimes, we wear Hanbok. It is traditional Korean clothes. Very colorful and pretty.
Yes, similar! But Chuseok is more about family and ancestor. And, um, we don’t eat turkey (*laughs*).
Of course! Many people welcome to join. It is fun and... um, meaningful. You can try songpyeon too!
You are welcome! If you come to Korea during Chuseok, I will show you everything!
Okay! Thank you for listening. I hope you enjoy learning about Chuseok.
You too! See you next time!
