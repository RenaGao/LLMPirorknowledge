Ah, yes. I plan to go... um... picnic with my family.
We will go to park. Big park near Han River. Very beautiful.
Yes, Hangang Park! We bring food and... um... blanket for sitting?
We make gimbap, fried chicken, and... um... fruit. Also, we will buy drink like soda.
Yes, we play... how to say... flying paper?
Yes, kite! And maybe ride bicycle if we rent.
We will go morning... um, 10 o’clock. Not too hot.
Yes. And we can take photos. My wife like to take many photos.
Thank you. I think so too.
Almost. I need to buy some snacks... and check weather. Oh, you know... um... for if it rains?
Yes, backup plan. Maybe go café if raining.
Me too. Thank you for listen.
Thank you! I hope you also have good weekend.
Yes, I will. Goodbye!
