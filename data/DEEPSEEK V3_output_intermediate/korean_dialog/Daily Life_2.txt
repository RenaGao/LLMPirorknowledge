Ah, yes! My favorite is... um... Korean dish. It called 비빔밥. How to say in English... mix rice?
First, you need rice. It is... main thing. Then, many vegetables. Um... spinach, carrot, and... what is this? 오이?
Yes, cucumber! And also, meat. Beef is best. You cook meat with soy sauce... and sesame oil. It make very tasty.
Oh, yes! Red pepper paste... 고추장. It is spicy, but very good. And egg. You fry egg and put on top.
Yes, I make it... um, every week. It is easy and healthy.
Of course! We can cook together. I show you... step by step.
Maybe... this weekend? Saturday afternoon?
Ah, thank you! I write list for you... so you know what to buy.
Me too! It will be fun.
Yes, see you on Saturday. Thank you for asking about my cooking!
You too! Goodbye!
