Ah, yes, teacher. Thank you for time. I have, um... question about it.
The part... about the presentation. It says "5-minute talk," but I don’t know... um, how to, uh, make it properly.
Yes, it is... "climate change." But I worry... um, how to say... I don’t think my English is good for long talk.
Ah, practice... yes. But, um... how many points I should say?
Oh, I see. So, first... say what is climate change, then... um, problems, and... how to fix it?
Thank you, teacher. But... um, how long is 5 minutes?
Ah, like a song... that’s easier. I will try it.
Yes, thank you so much, teacher. I will, um... practice hard.
Goodbye, teacher. See you in class!
Thank you, teacher. I will do my best!
Take care too. Goodbye!
Yes, teacher. Thank you again. Goodbye!
