Oh, hello! Um... I am little nervous. I study hard, but... grammar is... how to say... difficult for me.
Ah, I have problem with... um... present perfect? Like, "I have went" or "I have gone."
Yes, that is good idea. I will try. Do you have any... um... tips for reading part?
Highlight key words... I see. That sounds helpful. I will do that.
Oh, yes, please! When is good time for you?
Wednesday 2 PM is okay. We meet at library?
Thank you so much! I feel... um... more confident now.
I hope so. Thank you for your help. See you Wednesday!
Goodbye!
