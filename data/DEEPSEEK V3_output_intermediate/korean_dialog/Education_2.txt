Ah, yes, thank you, teacher. I... um, don’t understand the question number three. What it mean, “analyze the structure”?
Oh, I see. So, I need to write about... um, how the essay is... built?
Ah, understand now. Thank you, teacher. But, um... can you check my sentence? I write, “The essay have three part.” Is correct?
Ah, yes! “The essay has three parts.” Thank you for correcting me.
Um, no, I think... that’s all. Thank you very much, teacher.
Yes, thank you. I will do my best. See you next class!
You too, teacher. Goodbye!
