Ah, yes. Thank you for talking with me. I think the deadlines... um, they are too... too fast. We need more time, I think.
Maybe... we can ask manager for... uh, how to say... more time? Or divide work between us?
Yes, prioritize is good. I think... um, first we finish important thing, then the other.
Yes, schedule is good. I can make... um, list with all task and time.
Ah, yes. Weekly meeting is good. We can talk about problem and... um, find solution together.
Yes, Monday morning is okay for me. Thank you for... um, making this plan with me.
Yes, I agree. Tomorrow we talk to manager.
Thank you, too. I feel more... um, confident now. Letâ€™s do our best!
You too! See you tomorrow.
