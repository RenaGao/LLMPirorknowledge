Wednesday 3 p.m.? Um... I think I can. What we need to decide?
Um... maybe talk about new project and, um... how to say... progress of current work.
Ah, yes. Budget is important. Also, maybe we can talk about... team schedule?
I think... um, manager should lead. But maybe someone else can help with... uh, details.
Yes, Tuesday is good. Everyone has time to... um, prepare.
Thank you. I will check and, um... give feedback.
