Oh, yes, thank you! I... uh, I don’t understand the... um, problem about statistics. It is very difficult.
Yes, probability. I think... uh, how to calculate? I forget the formula.
Ah, yes, I remember now. But... um, I don’t know how to find favorable outcome. The problem is about... uh, rolling dice.
Um... one, two... maybe... six?
Ah, I see. So, total outcome is... um, 36? Because 6 times 6?
Oh, I understand now! Thank you so much. You are very helpful.
Yes, I will. And... um, next time, maybe I can help you too.
Yes, let’s do it. Thank you again. Have a good day!
