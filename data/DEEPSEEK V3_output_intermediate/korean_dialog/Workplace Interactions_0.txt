Yes, of course. I am here. What we need to talk?
Um, I think it’s okay. But I have problem with... how to say... the report part. It is difficult for me.
The data analysis. I need to make... uh, graph, but I don’t know which program is best.
Excel, yes. But Tableau is new for me. Maybe you can... teach me a little?
Tomorrow morning is... um, okay. What time is good?
Yes, 10 a.m. is fine. I will prepare my data before.
Almost. I finished first, uh, draft. Maybe you can check after I learn Tableau?
Thank you so much for helping. I was little worried.
Yes, I feel much better now. I will see you tomorrow at 10.
Okay, I will. Thank you again. Have a good day!
