I am good, thank you. How about you?
Oh, yes! In Hong Kong, we have many... um, rules for eating. For example, we always use chopsticks, and it’s not polite to... how to say... stick them in the rice.
Yes, yes. It looks like... um, funeral thing. Very bad.
In Hong Kong, when we eat with others, we share dishes. Everyone take food from same plate. But in America, I notice everyone have their own plate.
Yes, and also, in America, it’s okay to eat with hand, like pizza or burger. But in Hong Kong, we always use utensils.
Hmm... I think I like both. But eating with hand is... um... more easy sometimes.
In Hong Kong, when we drink tea, we tap the table to say thank you. It’s like... um... small gesture.
Yes, it’s very polite. In America, I don’t see this. People just say “thank you.”
Yes, I think it’s interesting. Every culture have their own way.
You’re welcome! I also enjoy talking about it.
Thank you, you too. Bye-bye!
