Ah, yes, I know. I feel... um, a little nervous about it. The test is for biology, right?
Yes, but I feel... how to say... not enough? I read the book, but some part is hard to understand.
Really? That is good idea! When you want to study?
Ah, Saturday afternoon... um, I have... uh, lunch with my family. Maybe after 2 p.m.?
Maybe the... um, thing about cells? Like, how they work? I think it is important for the test.
Thank you! I also have... um, flashcards. Maybe we can use them to test each other?
Um, yes, the part about... um, DNA and RNA. It is so confusing for me.
Oh, recipe! That make sense. Thank you for helping me.
Yes, I will be there. Thank you so much, I feel more... um, confident now.
See you Saturday! Thank you, goodbye!
