Ah, yes, thank you. I want to learn… um… cooking.
Because I want to make healthy food. Now I eat… um, outside food too much. Not good for health.
Yes, I want to cook… Chinese food. My family always cook at home, but I never learn.
Um, I like stir-fry vegetables. But I don’t know how to use… the pan properly. The heat is always… too much or too little.
Yes, I watch YouTube. But sometimes… um, I don’t understand the English words.
That’s good idea. I will try. Also, I need to practice more. Now I just… um, boil noodles.
Yes, I think so. Cooking is important because… it can make me feel happy and healthy.
Yes, my sister. She also want to learn. We can practice together.
Yes, I think so too. Thank you for listening to my… um… plan.
Thank you! I will try my best. See you next time!
