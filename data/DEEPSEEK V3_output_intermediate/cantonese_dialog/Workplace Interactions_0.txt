Good morning, um... it’s okay. I finish some part, but still have some... uh, how to say... not done yet.
I need to do the... um... thing for checking the data. And also prepare the... uh... report?

Okay, thank you. I will try my best.
Um... yes. For the report, I need to use the... uh... software for making slides. Which one we use?
Yes, I have. But I not very good at it.
Okay, that’s good. Thank you so much.
No, I think that’s all. I will work hard.
