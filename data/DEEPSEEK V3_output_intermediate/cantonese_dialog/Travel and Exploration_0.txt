**[Scene: Two friends, Alex (NS) and Mei (L2, Cantonese), are planning a trip with friends to a new city.]**
Ah, yes! We want go to... um, how to say... San Francisco. That one, is it right?
We think maybe... see Golden Gate Bridge, and um, eat good food. Also, walk to the... uh, how to say... the sea place.
Yes, yes! Fishermanâ€™s Wharf. I hear it is very famous.
We are... um, five people. My friends from school.
Not yet. We think maybe stay in... what is it called... hotel? Or maybe rent house.
Ah, yes, Airbnb! My friend say it is good. But I worry... uh, how to say... it is too much money.
That is good idea. I will tell my friends. Thank you!
We think rent car, but... um, Alex, is it easy to drive there? I hear very busy.
Okay, maybe we use bus or... um, train. Is it safe?
I see. Thank you for help, Alex. You make me feel more relax.
Next month, um... 15th to 18th.
Yes, I think so! Thank you again, Alex. You are very helpful.
I will! Goodbye, Alex. See you later!
