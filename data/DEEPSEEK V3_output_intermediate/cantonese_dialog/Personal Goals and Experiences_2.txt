Ah, yes. Recently, I finish... um, finish my first 10-kilometre run. It was hard, but I do it!
I run every day, but not so much at first. Slowly, I run more... uh, longer. And I eat healthy food.
I feel very happy! And... um, proud. It is big thing for me because before, I never think I can do it.
It mean... um, how to say... I can do things if I try hard. Even if it look difficult at first.
Yes, yes! Now I think maybe I can try... um, half marathon next time. But I need more practice.
Thank you. I will try my best!
Hmm... I think it teach me to not give up. Even when body feel tired, I tell myself, ‘Keep going!’
Thank you for listening. I’m happy to share.
Thank you, you too! See you next time.
