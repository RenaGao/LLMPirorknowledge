Hi! I’m fine, thank you. How about you?
Ah, yes! I like to watch… um, how to say… “love story” movie. Like “Titanic.” Very touching.
Yes, I also like “The Notebook.” The story is… um, very sad but beautiful. You know it?
TV show… um, I like “Friends.” It is funny and make me happy.
I like Phoebe. She is… um, very funny and different.
Um, I try “The Big Bang Theory.” It is good but… sometimes the joke is too fast, I cannot understand.
Yes, I use subtitles. It helps a lot.
Action movie… I watch sometimes, like “Mission Impossible.” It is exciting but… I prefer love story.
Yes, I like Korean drama. The story is… um, very detailed and emotional.
Thank you! I enjoy talking with you. Let’s talk again soon!
You too! Goodbye!
