Ah, yes, thank you! I... um, I look for the big clock tower. Is it near here?
Ah, town hall clock. How to walk there?
Straight... then left at the... um, light for cars?
Ah, I see. Red building. Thank you very much!
Um... maybe... is there a good place to eat near the clock?
Oh, good! I like sandwiches. How to find the café?
So, café is on the right... near the clock. Thank you again!
Yes, I will enjoy it. Thank you so much for helping!
You too! Goodbye!
