Oh! My favorite holiday... um, is Lunar New Year. It is very special for us.
We, um, spend time with family. And we eat many food, like... dumplings and fish. Also, we give red envelope. It is... how to say... money gift.
Yes! We put up red things, like paper with lucky words. And we clean house before New Year. It means... um, make everything new.
I like... um, setting off fireworks. It is very fun and loud. Also, I enjoy... um, visiting temple to pray for good luck.
Yes, I visit my grandparents and, um, cousins. We eat together and talk. It is... very warm feeling.
Yes, it is. I always happy to celebrate it.
You are welcome! Do you have favorite holiday too?
Oh, I see. It sounds nice. Maybe one day I can celebrate Christmas too.
Thank you for listening! It was nice to talk.
Yes, letâ€™s talk again. Have a good day!
