Good morning! My morning is... um, okay. I wake up at 7, then I eat breakfast.
I eat... um, congee. And also toast. Sometimes fruit.
Yes, I drink tea. Green tea. But coffee... um, not so much. It makes me... how to say... too awake?
Yes, jittery! I donâ€™t like that feeling.
I... um, take shower. Then I go to work.
I take MTR. It is... um, faster than walking.
About... um, 30 minutes. Sometimes more if it is busy.
Yes, I listen to music. Um, Cantonese pop songs. They are very... relaxing.
Yes, I like... um, Eason Chan. His songs are... how to say... touching?
Yes, emotional! I like that.
Thank you for listening! I enjoy talking with you.
You too. See you later!
