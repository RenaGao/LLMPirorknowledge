**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, cake is important for birthday. Maybe chocolate cake? Elena favorite is chocolate.
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Games are fun! Maybe we can play... um... how to say... guessing game? Or cards?
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Elena finish work at 6. Maybe we start at 7? So we have time to prepare.
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, yes! Must keep secret. No one tell her, or... surprise is gone.
**Speaker B (L2, Cantonese)**: Yes, good idea. I can write the message. Then everyone know their... um... duty?
