Yes, I have time. But I have some question about the task.
Um, the part about... how to say... the last question. I don’t understand what it mean.
Yes, question 5. It say, "analyze the impact"... but I don’t know what "impact" mean here.
Ah, I see. So I need to say... how it change the situation?
Okay, I think I understand now. But also, the grammar... is it "cause" or "caused"?
Ah, "caused." Thank you, teacher.
No, I think it’s clear now. Thank you for your help.
I will. Thank you, teacher. Goodbye!
You too, teacher. See you next class.
