Ah, yes! Um, I think first we need to... uh, talk about the project progress. Is it correct?
Maybe we can, um, talk about the problem. Like, the... the thing that make the work slow.
Yes, yes! Challenges. Also, I think we need to... um, plan the next step. Like, future work.
Yes, but... um, maybe we can add one more? Like, team... team activity? For, uh, make everyone happy.
Yes, team-building. I think it is important for make team... um, work better together.
Yes, that sound good. But... um, how much time we have for each?
Okay, but maybe... um, challenges need more time? Sometimes it take long to explain.
Yes, that is better. Also, who will... uh, lead each part?
Um, yes, I can try. And maybe someone else can, uh, organize team activity?
I think so. If we forget something, we can add later, right?
Thank you too! I think the meeting will be, um, very useful.
You too, see you soon!
