Ah, yes. I think... we can have party at her home? Or maybe, um, restaurant?
I can cook... um, Chinese food? Like dumplings and fried rice. Or we can order pizza, it is easy.
Ah, decorations... I can buy balloons and, um, thing for making color... uh, how to say?
Yes, streamers! I will buy balloons and streamers.
Yes, Saturday is good. Jenny no work that day. Um, how we surprise her?
Oh, I like that idea! It will be very fun.
Okay, I understand. I will buy decorations tomorrow and cook on Saturday morning.
Yes, I think Jenny will be very happy. Thank you for organizing.
Okay, I will message you on Friday. See you then!
Yes, definitely. Bye!
