Hello, Sarah. My name is... um, Ming. Nice to meet you.
Yes, I just move here last month. Still... um, how to say... not so familiar?
I live in Hong Kong before. It is... um, very different here.
I work in... um, IT. I fix computer and, uh, make program.
Yes, I like it. Sometimes is... um, challenge? But I enjoy solve problem.
I like to cook. In Hong Kong, I often cook dim sum. Here, I try to learn... um, Western food?
Not so many. I am... um, a little shy. But I want to make more friend.
Thank you, Sarah. You are very kind.
Yes, nice meeting you too. I hope we can... um, talk again soon.
You too, Sarah. Bye!
