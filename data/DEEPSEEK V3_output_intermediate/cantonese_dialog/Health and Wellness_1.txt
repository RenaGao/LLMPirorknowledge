Ah, yes, I feel a little bit... um, not so good. I work many late night.
I know, but I need finish work. My boss... uh, give me many task.
Bedtime routine? What is... how to say... how to do it?
Oh, I see. I try but always... uh, my phone too exciting.
Yes, I think I try this. Also, I feel very... um, how to say... no energy?
Yes, tired all time. Maybe because I eat... uh, quick-food only.
I try, but I donâ€™t know... uh, how to cook.
Oh, that sound... um, not so hard. I try it. Thank you for advice.
Yes, I will start walk in the park. Maybe... uh, 20 minutes?
Thank you very much. I feel more... um, hopeful now.
Okay, I will. Goodbye and thank you again!
