Ah, yes! Last week, I go hiking. It was... um, very beautiful place.
It was in Tai Mo Shan. Um, highest mountain in Hong Kong.
The view was... how to say... very wow. I see many trees and clouds. And the air was... um, very fresh.
At first, I feel tired. But after some time, I feel... uh, happy and strong. Like, my mind is clear.
Yes, I go with my friend. We talk a lot and... um, laugh together. It was good time.
Yes! When we reach the top, the sun was setting. The sky is... um, orange and pink. Very beautiful.
I feel peaceful. Like, all my... um, problem is gone.
Yes, I want to go again. Maybe next month.
Thank you for listen to me. It was nice talking.
You too. Goodbye!
