Hello, Alex. I’m Lily. Nice to meet you too.
Um, I like... uh, how to say... watching movie. And sometimes I go to nature... uh, park? To relax.
I like... um, funny movies, and also... uh, how to say... drama? Movies with feelings.
Yes, my favorite is... uh, "In the Mood for Love." Very beautiful movie.
Yes, I like... uh, Kowloon Park. It is near my home. Very... uh, quiet and green.
Yes, I go there... um, every weekend. Sometimes I take book and sit... uh, how to say... under tree.
I like... uh, novels. And also... um, how to say... books about travel. I like to learn about new places.
Yes, I want to go to... uh, Iceland. I see pictures, very beautiful. But also... um, very cold!
Thank you! And you, Alex? What you like to do?
Oh, that’s nice! Maybe we can watch movie together someday.
Yes, nice talking to you too, Alex. Let’s... um, meet again soon!
You too, Alex. Goodbye!
