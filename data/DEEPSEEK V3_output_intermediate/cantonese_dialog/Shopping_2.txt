Hello! I have, um, problem with this thing. I buy it last week, but it is not working.
Yes, here it is. Receipt is... um, somewhere. Ah, here!
I want to... um, exchange it, please. If possible.
Ah, okay. Thank you. Do I need to... um, pay more money if they have new one?
That’s good. I hope they have it.
Oh, great! So, I just give you this one and take the new one?
Thank you so much. You are very helpful.
No, that’s all. Thank you again.
You too. Goodbye!
