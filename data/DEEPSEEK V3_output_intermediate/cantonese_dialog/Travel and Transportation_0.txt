I’m good, thank you! I just come back from trip.
I go to Kyoto. It is very beautiful city.
I visit many temple. And I see, um... how to say... very old house with garden.
Yes, yes! Machiya. Very quiet and nice place.
Yes, I eat sushi and... um... matcha dessert. Very delicious.
I like matcha ice cream. And also, um, soft cake with matcha.
It was sunny and cool. Good weather for walk around.
Yes, I take many photo. The scenery is very... um... how to say... nice for photography.
Yes, scenic! I send you some photo later.
You’re welcome! Next time, you also can visit Kyoto.
Okay, see you next time!
