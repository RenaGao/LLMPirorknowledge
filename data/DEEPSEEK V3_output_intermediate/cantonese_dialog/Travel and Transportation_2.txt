Ah, yes! I thinking... maybe beach? Many sun, very relaxing.
Um... how to say... Bora Bora? Or maybe Bali? I hear Bali is very beautiful.
I think Bali is better. More, um... budget-friendly. And it have many activities.
I want to... um... swim in the sea. And also see temple. And maybe try local food.
Yes, shopping also good! I like to buy... uh, souvenirs for family.
Maybe one week? Not too long, but enough to relax and see things.
Villa is better, I think. More private, and we can cook if we want.
Yes, split cost is fair. We can share everything.
Maybe September? Weather is good, and not too many people.
Yes, Iâ€™m very excited! Thank you for organizing this.
Okay, see you soon! Bye-bye!
