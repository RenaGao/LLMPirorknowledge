Yes, teacher. I have some question about the... um, assignment.
The part about... how to say... the presentation? I don’t understand what you mean by "visual aids."
Oh, I see! Like, um, PowerPoint with picture?
Okay, okay. But how many... um, how many slides I need?
Okay, 5 to 7 slides. And the time... um, how long I speak?
Okay, 5 minutes. I will practice.
Um... no, I think it’s clear now. Thank you, teacher.
Thank you, teacher. I will try my best. Goodbye!
