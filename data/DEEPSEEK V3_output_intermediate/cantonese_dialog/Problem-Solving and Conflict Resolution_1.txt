Ensure the L2 speaker has intermediate-level English proficiency and the NS speak simply for easy understanding..
**L2 (Cantonese)**: Ah, I’m okay, but I have problem with my internet. It’s not working for two days now.
**L2**: Yes, I call them yesterday, but they... um... how to say... they not help much. They say they check, but nothing change.
**L2**: No, they just say “we look into it.” But I need internet for work. It’s very... uh... important.
**L2**: Supervisor? Ah, yes, maybe I will try that. But I feel... um... nervous to speak more.
**L2**: Okay, I will try. Maybe I say, “Can I talk to someone... uh... higher position?”
**L2**: Yes, manager! I will say that. Thank you for helping me.
**L2**: I will. If they don’t fix it, maybe I... uh... change company.
**L2**: Yes, but first I try again with manager. Thank you so much for your advice!
**L2**: Me too. Bye for now!
