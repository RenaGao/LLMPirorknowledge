Ah, yes! My favorite is... um, how to say... egg with rice and meat.
Yes, yes! Fried rice! I make it often because it is... easy and tasty.
Okay. First, I cook rice before. Then, I fry egg in pan until... until it is soft. After, I add meat—usually pork—and cook until it is... um, no more pink.
Yes, yes. Then, I mix everything in pan and add... um, soy sauce and salt. Also, I like to put some green onion for... for smell.
Um... sometimes I add little bit... um, sesame oil? It makes more... more tasty.
Not long. Maybe... 20 minutes? If I prepare rice before, it is very fast.
Yes, very good for busy day. And you can... you can change meat or add vegetable if you want.
I can teach you if you want!
No problem! I like talking about food.
Yes, sounds good. See you later!
You too! Bye!
Me too! Let’s do it next week.
Goodbye! See you soon!
