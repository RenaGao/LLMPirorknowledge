Hello, um… I have problem with my recent buy.
I buy phone last week, but it not work… um, how to say… it cannot turn on.
Yes, I charge it many time, but still… no power. It is like… dead.
Yes, I have receipt. It is in my bag… wait, I find it. Here, the number is 123456.
Thank you. I worry because it is new phone, and I need it for work.
Thank you. You very kind.
Ah, I think… I want new phone. How long it take?
Yes, that is okay. But… how I return the old phone?
Okay, I understand. Thank you for help.
No, that is all. Thank you very much.
Thank you, you too. Goodbye!
