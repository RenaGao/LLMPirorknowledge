Yes, I think it’s... um, maybe good for me. But I not sure about some feature.
First, the... uh, storage? It says 512GB. Is it enough for many files?
Okay, I see. And the RAM... it’s 16GB. Is it enough for... um, multitask?
That’s good! Also, the battery life... it says 10 hours. Is it real?
Ah, I understand. And the... um, screen size? It’s 15 inches. Is it too big for carry around?
Hmm, I think 15 inches is okay. I like bigger screen for work.
No, I think... um, that’s all. Thank you for helping me.
Yes, I think I will buy it. Thank you so much!
You too! See you later!
