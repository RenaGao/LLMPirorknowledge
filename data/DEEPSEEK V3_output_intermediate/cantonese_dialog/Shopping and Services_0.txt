Hello! Yes, I need... um, thing for cooking. But I not sure which one is good.
Ah, pan! I need pan for fry... fried rice. My old pan is, uh, broken now.
Non-stick... yes, I think that is good. But, um, how to know which one is better?
Oh, I see. And the price... is it expensive?
Warranty? Ah, like... if it broken, you fix it?
That sounds good. Um, I think I will take this one.
Yes, please. And um... thank you for help me.
I hope so! Thank you again. Have a good day!
Goodbye! See you next time.
