Ah, hello! This necklace is... um, 50 dollar. It is made from silver.
$35? Um... I think, maybe... $40? Is better for me.
It is... um, handmake by local artist. Very unique! And the design is... inspired by the mountain.
Yes, $40 is lowest. For you, I give good price because you like it so much.
Ah, sorry, only cash. But there is ATM near here.
Of course! I keep it for you. Come back anytime.
Okay, see you soon! Take your time.
Thank you! I hope you enjoy the necklace. Have a nice day!
Bye! See you next time.
