Um, yes. My favorite place is… uh, beach. I like the beach very much.
It is… Repulse Bay. In Hong Kong. Near my home.
I like… um, the sea is very clear. And the sand is soft. Also, there are many trees. It is… um, relaxing.
Yes, I swim. And sometimes I… how to say… lie on the sand and… um, listen to music.
Yes, yes! Sunbathing. And I also like to eat… um, snacks. There are… small shops selling food.
Hmm, yes, sometimes. But I go early morning. Then not many people. And it’s… um, cooler.
Yes, almost… every week. It’s my… um, happy place.
Yes, I feel… very calm there. I forget all… um, problems.
Yes, you also should visit. It is… um, very beautiful.
You are welcome! Thank you for listening.
Yes, I am happy to talk about it. Um, have a nice day!
Thank you! I will. Goodbye!
