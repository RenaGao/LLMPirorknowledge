Ah, hello. I have problem with my computer. It... um... not turn on.
Yes, yes. I press button, but nothing happen.
Plugged in? Ah, yes. I check already. The... um... wire is connected.
No, no light. No sound, nothing.
Um... hold button for 10 seconds? Okay, I try. *[Pauses]* No, still not work.
Another cable? I think I have one. Let me check... *[Pauses]* Yes, I try now. *[Pauses]* Still same problem.
Power supply? Is it... um... big problem?
Warranty? Yes, I think so. I buy it one year ago.
Ah, okay. Thank you.
My name is Wing. The computer is... um... HP Notebook.
Okay, thank you. You help me a lot.
No, thatâ€™s all. Thank you again.
You too. Goodbye!
