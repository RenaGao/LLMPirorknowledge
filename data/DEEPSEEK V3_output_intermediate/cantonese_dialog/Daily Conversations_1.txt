Oh, hi! Yes, I have plan. I think to go shopping with my friend Wing.
Um, maybe some clothes and... how to say... things for home? Like, for kitchen.
Yes, yes, household items. And also maybe... um, we eat lunch together.
There is a restaurant near mall. We go there before. Food is good, and not too expensive.
Maybe... um, if time is enough, we go to park. Wing like to walk and take photos.
We meet at ten oâ€™clock. Early is better, because later too many people.
No, thank you. We take bus together. It is easy.
Sunday... um, I think I stay home. Maybe watch movie or... um, do some cleaning.
I like comedy. Maybe I watch new one from... um, America.
Yes, thank you! And I hope your weekend is good too.
Yes, we talk next week. Have a good weekend!
Bye!
