Ah, yes, thank you. I want to... um, get more strong and healthy. I feel tired, so I need more exercise.
Yes, but not... um, how to say, not regular. Sometimes I run, but not every day. Maybe two time a week.
Yes, I hear weight training is good. But I don’t know how to start. It looks... um, difficult.
Maybe three or four time a week. But not too hard. I don’t want to feel... um, very tired.
Yes, I try to eat less... um, unhealthy food. I like vegetables and fish, but sometimes I eat too much rice.
I think focus on exercise first. Then later, maybe we can talk about food.
Yes, that sound good. Thank you for... um, helping me.
Um... how long should I do each exercise?
Okay, 30 minutes is... um, not too long. I can do that.
Yes, next week is okay. Thank you!
You too. See you then!
