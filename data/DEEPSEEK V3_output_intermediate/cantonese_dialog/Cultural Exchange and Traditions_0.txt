Ah, yes! I talk about Mid-Autumn Festival. It very important in Hong Kong.
We eat mooncake, um, round cake with sweet thing inside. And also... we light lantern, like colorful light.
It is about family together. We sit and watch moon, very big and round. Also, old story about... um... lady fly to moon.
Yes! Family is very important in our culture. Also, we give mooncake to friends, like gift.
I like lotus seed one, with egg yolk inside. It is salty and sweet, very delicious.
Yes, we meet at my grandma house. We eat together, talk, and children play with lantern.
Yes, it make me happy. Many good memory from this festival.
You are welcome! Maybe one day you can come and see it.
Okay, you too! See you next time!
