Ah, hello Sarah! My name is Alex. First day is... um, good but a bit nervous.
Yes, please. I not familiar with this system. Is it... um, difficult to learn?
Okay, I understand. Log in with email and password. After that, what should I do?
Ah, I see. So I click project, then see task. How to... um... how to mark task as finish?
Oh, very simple. And if I have question about task, who I... um... who I ask for help?
That is very kind. Thank you, Sarah. I think I can... um... do it now.
It looks... um, clear. I will try it later.
Thank you, Sarah. I am glad to be here too. See you later!
You too, Sarah. Goodbye!
