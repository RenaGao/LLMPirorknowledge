Yes, thank you. The timeline is... um, too short. I think we need more time, but I don’t know how to say to team.
Yes, yes. It’s... how to say... stressful. And the task is very big.
Yes, good idea. Smaller steps... easier to do. But how to tell team? I worry they not agree.
Ah, okay. Complex project... smaller tasks. I will try to say like this.
Um, yes. The team... sometimes they not listen to me. Maybe because my English not good.
Okay, I will try. Thank you for help.
Yes, sounds good. I will try this way.
Okay, thank you so much. I feel better now.
You too. Bye-bye!
