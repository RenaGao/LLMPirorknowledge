Hi! No plan yet. Maybe we can... um, go out?
Yes, dinner is good. I want eat... um, Chinese food?
There is one in Central. It is... um, how to say... very delicious.
How about... um, seven o’clock? Not too early, not too late.
Yes! Maybe we can... um, walk by the harbor? The view is very nice.
Yes! And we can... um, take some photo.
Good idea! I am... um, excited.
Yes, seven o’clock. I will... uh, see you there.
See you!
Hmm... maybe, um, Mei? She also like Chinese food.
Okay! If she can come, it will be... um, more fun.
Thank you! Then... until seven, we see each other.
Me too! See you later, okay?
