Ah, yes. I feel... um, not happy because you no come to dinner with me.
Ah, yes, I say 7 p.m., but maybe my English not clear. I think you forget me.
It’s okay... I just feel... um, lonely when you no come.
Thank you. Next time, I will also... um, say time more clear.
Yes, I feel better. I happy we talk about it.
Yes, very important. I... um, don’t want to lose friend because of small thing.
That sound good! What time will we meet?
Okay, 7 p.m. I will wait for you.
Yes, I think we will. Thank you for talking with me.
See you then!
