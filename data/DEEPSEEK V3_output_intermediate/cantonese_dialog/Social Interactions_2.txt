Oh, hello! I am good, good. How about you? It’s really been long time!
Uncle John is... um, he is good too. Sometimes his back pain, but now better.
Yes, yes, he still teaching math. But he say maybe retire next year.
Um, he say he want to travel. Maybe go Japan or Korea. He like food there!
Ah, yes! I plan to visit my sister in Toronto. Maybe stay two week. I very miss her!
I think... um, next month. After Christmas. How about you?
Oh, that is nice too. Family time is very important.
Yes, yes. I agree.
Yes, thank you for call. It’s good to talk to you. Take care, okay?
I will, I will. Goodbye!
