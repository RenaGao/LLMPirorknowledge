Oh, yes, thank you! I... um, want to go to hotel. Do you know where is it?
Ah, yes, it is... um, Sunshine Hotel.
Really? Can you tell me how to go there?
Straight... then right. And it is on... left side?
Okay, okay. Thank you so much!
Um, I think no. I go to hotel now.
Thank you! You are very kind. Goodbye!
