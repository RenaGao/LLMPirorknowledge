Ah, yes, of course. What is the matter?
Oh… um, actually, I feel a bit sad about it. I thought you don’t want me to come.
Really? I was not busy. But I think… maybe we have misunderstanding.
It’s okay. I also sorry if I think wrong. Maybe next time we can… um, how to say… talk more clearly?
Yes, that is good idea. I feel better now. Thank you for explain.
Yes, friends! And next time, I will also… um, ask you if I have question.
Thank you too. I feel happy we talk today.
Okay! See you later, then.
Bye!
