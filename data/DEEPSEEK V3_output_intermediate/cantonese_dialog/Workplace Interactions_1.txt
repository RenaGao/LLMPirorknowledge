Okay. I try... um, it’s working. Now, what I should do next?
Dashboard... is it like main page?
I see. I click... ah, now I see the tasks inside. How to add new task?
Oh, I try... um, how to say... it’s easy?
Okay, I save it. What next?
Assign... yes, I try. I choose my colleague, John. Is it correct?
Um... yes. How to check if task is done?

Okay, I will. Thank you again, Sara. See you later!
You too! Goodbye!
