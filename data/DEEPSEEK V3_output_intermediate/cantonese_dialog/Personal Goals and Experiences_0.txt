Ah, yes, thank you. My goal is to... um, improve my English. I want speak more... how to say... fluently.
I think I will... um, practice every day. Maybe I join English class, and also... um, watch English movie.
Yes, I like action movie. But sometimes, it is hard to understand. They speak too fast.
Oh, good idea! I will try that. Also, I plan to read English book. Maybe... um, children book first?
Yes, I think so. And I want to... um, find English friend to practice talking.
I hope so. But sometimes I feel shy because of my... uh, grammar mistake.
Thank you, that make me feel better. I will try not to be shy.
Yes, I understand. Progress is important.
Yes, thatâ€™s right. And I will practice every day.
Thank you for your advice. It is very helpful.
Yes, thank you! See you next time.
Goodbye!
