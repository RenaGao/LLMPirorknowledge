Ah, yes, thank you! We plan to go to… um, the park. But I need some help to decide what to bring.
Yes, but not sure. Maybe sandwiches? And some fruit… like apple or banana.
Um, chicken sandwich? Or maybe egg sandwich. My family like both.
Oh, yes! We will bring… how to say… uh, water and juice. And maybe tea in bottle.
Snacks? Ah, maybe… how to say… chips? And some cake for dessert.
Oh, yes! Thank you for remind me. We have blanket at home. I will bring it.
Maybe… um, how about game? What game we can play in park?
Oh, frisbee is good idea. My family like to play frisbee. I think they will enjoy.
Yes, thank you so much for your help! I feel more ready now.
Thank you! We will enjoy it. See you next time!
