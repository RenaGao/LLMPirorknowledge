Ah, hello! I am... um, not so ready yet. I feel a little... how to say... nervous?
I think math part is most difficult. I understand some, but the... uh, equation? Very hard for me.
Yes, I practice every day, but sometimes I forget the... um, steps? Like, how to solve it step by step.
Really? That will be very helpful! Thank you, thank you. When we can... um, meet?
Tomorrow after class is good for me! Yes, I will come.
Okay, I will bring... um, all my papers. And also, I have some question about the... uh, geometry part.
I hope so! Thank you for helping me. I feel better now.
Yes, tomorrow after class. I will see you there!
See you, and thank you again! I will be ready.
