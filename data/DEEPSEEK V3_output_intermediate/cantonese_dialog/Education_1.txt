Oh, yes, thank you! I... um, I don’t understand the differentiation part. It’s very confusing.
Yes, I think it is... um, find the slope of a curve? But the formula is very hard for me.
Um... I think it is 2x? But I don’t know why.
Ah, I think so. So, it’s like... um, the speed of the function?
Wait, I’m not sure... is it... um, 9x²?
I think... you multiply the 3 by the power, then minus one from the power?
Um, it’s... 16x³?
Thank you! Now I feel more... um, confident. But I still need more practice.
Yes, that would be very helpful! Thank you so much.
Okay, thank you! I will practice and let you know if I get stuck.
Thank you! See you later!
