Ah, yes! In Hong Kong, we have... um... Mid-Autumn Festival. It is very important.
We eat mooncake. It is... uh, round cake, very sweet. And we use lanterns, like... um, light up in the night.
Both! Children carry lanterns, and some people hang them. Also, we... um... how to say... gather with family. It is time for togetherness.
Yes! There is... um... Chang'e. She is moon goddess. The festival is for... um... celebrating the moon, and also for... uh, harvest time.
Yes! Children play with... um... fire dragon dance. It is... uh, dragon made with fire and people dance with it. Very exciting!
Yes, every year. It is... um... important for family and friends. We eat mooncake, watch moon, and enjoy time together.
