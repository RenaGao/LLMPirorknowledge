Okay.  Hello?   
Yeah, uh, I am - I am one of your customer.
So I - my friend and I went to - to your restaurant.  And I know actually that uh your restaurant did not prohibit smoking.  But  
Yeah.
But my friend and I felt you know not - not comfy with - with the smoke, with the cigarettes there.
So I, me - uh, my friend and I didn't finish our meals.  So I think it is uh - I think I need you to - you know just to refund our money because we didn't finish the meals because of the smoke.
Yeah.
Yes I do but I think it just have to be cleaner than that.  You know maybe you should make a - a room for the smoking one - for the smoking area.
Yeah, but we didn't finish our food because of the smoke.
Yes, it is, but we didn't finish our meals because - because of the smoke.
So I think that your restaurant has to make a - like a smoking area so other people also can finish their foods, like my friend and I.
Yeah, but they just say that, yeah, call our manager, call our manager.
Oh, yeah, they didn't want to because that is not their job.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah it's okay.
The refund is not really important, actually it's just for the comfortable.
Yeah, thank you so much.  I'm sorry for disturbing you  
Yeah, bye.
