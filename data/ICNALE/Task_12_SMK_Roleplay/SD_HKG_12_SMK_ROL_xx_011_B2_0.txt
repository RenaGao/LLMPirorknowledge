Okay.  Oh I am - I am just explain the---
So, can I, um - can I get the money back and - and - and up - and will you apologize for - for me and my friends in - in - in this, um, situation?
Um, so, um, and is there any other alternative, uh, then refund maybe, um, your, uh, restaurant's coupons or - or discount next time.
Um, so, um, as the restaurant is - uh, is - is - did not prohibit smoking so, um, I may, uh, friend do not, uh, come to this restaurant next time, so um - so I now do not need any refund, I am sorry.
Um, um, I think, um, prohibit smoke - smoking is, uh, is a, um, important, um, boost to or loss, uh, to - to the restaurant because, um, restaurant is a perfect - uh, perfect area.  And you cannot just focus - uh, you cannot just protect the benefits to those smoker, but you also need to, um, take care of those non-smoker and when they are, uh - when they are dining with those smoker.  So, uh, the smoke really will - will really, uh, make the diner do not have, uh, any appetite, uh, they may feel very uncomfortable during they were dining.
