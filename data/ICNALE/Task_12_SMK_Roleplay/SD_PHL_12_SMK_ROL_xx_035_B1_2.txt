Ah hello is this the owner of the restaurant?
Umm umm ah earlier, we had we had lunch at your restaurant and I really didn't like the ambience that that that your rest I-I didn't like the ambience and the service that your restaurant gave me.  Umm I know that you did not prohibit smoking, but it was not right that you let people ah smoke in inside of your restaurant.  It's not good for people as they were eating as we were eating.  Can I ask for a refund?
Why not?
But isn't all isn't customer always right?
