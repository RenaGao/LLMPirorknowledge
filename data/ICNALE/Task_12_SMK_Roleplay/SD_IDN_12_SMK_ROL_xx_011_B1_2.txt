Okay.  Hello.
Okay.  I am Nadya.  Can I speak to the marketing?
Oh okay.
Oh yeah.  I am so sorry because I had to make some complaint because recently I went to a restaurant with my friends to have a meal, and I know this is - yeah, I mean like your restaurant not prohibit anyone to smoking.  But there are too many people smoke there and me and my friend couldn't endure the smell of the cigarettes, so uh, unfortunately we had to leave the restaurant and both of us had not finished meals yet.  And could I ask you to refund the money for us because I feel so uncomfortable there because so many smoke.
Yeah, I know it.  But then still, you know if it's dangerous for someone to have a meal near the smoke, maybe - I mean this is just a suggestion, could you make kind of two place, one is the smoking area and the other one is no smoking area because not everybody can endure the smoke, so could you consider about that.
I see.
Uh-huh.
I didn't.
Yeah, we just left  
Okay.  I see.  Thank you so much.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can understand that.  Thank you so much but can you for next time - I mean like make my suggestion - like can you please  
Yeah, sure.
Okay, but then still a lot of people cannot endure smoke even though the consumers of yours mostly smokers, but then I think my suggestion is better, I mean is a good suggestion to consider  .
Okay.  It's okay.
Okay.
