Um, recently I, um, went to your restaurant with my friend to have a meal and I think your meal, um, was perfectly fine for me and my friend.  However, um, we felled sick, uh, when we have a meal because, um, there were lots of smokers in your restaurant.  And I also noticed that your restaurant doesn't, um, label, um, there is some non-smoking area so which cause lots of people smoke in your restaurant.  And then, that smell of cigarette, uh, we cannot bear so we decide to, um, leave - left your restaurant.  And, now I want you have a refund because of that.
Why?
Um, even those smokers smoke, uh, near windows because the number of smokers quite big so windows are not enough for the smokers to like, um, to keep the smell of cigarette away from the windows and the smells of cigarettes still keep in your restaurant so that which make us feel sick or unwell.  So, I think we still want to have a refund from restaurant.
But, because, um - because of your situa - your restaurant situation you didn't put any label in your restaurant and then caused a lot of, um, smokers smoke in your restaurant and which make lots of consumers, uh, feel uncomfortable, especially, um, when we have a meal and then I saw some of the consumers also feel unwell but they - but they chose to endure the smell of the cigarette.  And they - they kept - they kept complaining but they don't, um - they didn't speak in front of you because, um, they afraid that you may not accept - accept them request or their complaint so they not willing to, um, say, uh, anything to you before me because me and my friend cannot like to bear this kind of disgusting smell so we decided to go.  So I think, uh, we have to refund.
