Okay.  So hi, um, me and my friend went to the - went to your restaurant last time, but, um, there is too many smoke in the restaurant and after - after we - uh, we ordered we find out that there is too much smoke in the restaurant that we cannot eat properly.  So, I am calling to have a refund for me and my friend since we didn't enjoy our meal.
Um, why?
Yeah.
We didn't enjoy the meal because it was - everyone was smoking and the smoke started affecting the taste of the meal and there's dust everywhere due to the smoking.
Okay, but smoking in a restaurant is not a good practice.  So like don't you think there's a problem with like all the smoke in the restaurant?
Yeah but it was not - because when we walk in it was, uh, pretty early in the day so non - not much - really much people but when we - when we started eating there is more and more people and they all started smoking.  So that become a problem.
Such as?
But there is going to be a lot of people smoking also.
Okay.  Is there a time that you can set with like no people smoke?
Okay.  We'll think about coming again if there is like - if this can or like but one more important part is my friend cannot stand a smoke so my friend might not come back again.
