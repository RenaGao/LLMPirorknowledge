Have some, uh - first of all, give me the main menu and now I have decided to eat, uh, two---
Yeah.
Okay.
Uh, today I, uh, come there in your restaurants--- 
---and, uh, there was a guy who was smoking and I didn't eat the food, uh, comfortably so I want my - uh, refund my money back.  So kindly give me.
It is because I didn't eat the food because I am allergic to smoking and I stop the boy not to spoke but he continuously, uh, doing it.
But why?
So---
---what can I do.
---now.
That is your mistake.  You have to, uh---
Why?  You have to, uh, pay attention on this and you have to stop the smoking in the restaurant.
Because there are many different people come here who have allergy.  If you like it doesn't mean everyone like the smoking and smell of that.
So - but I didn't eat the food.
In our country everyone said that smoking is not in - smoking is injurious to health but you said that you permit everyone like how.
You can.
But I want.
XXX  I didn't eat the food due to the smoker, so I want back because I'm allergic from the smoking so kindly give me my money. 
Uh, the way of menu and the way of present - presenting the food, uh, all matters first of all.  Then the taste and other things are come in---
Uh, yeah.
Uh, one time I go to the XXX  and the way of presenting their food, it's much impressing and, uh - first of all thing is affect us the way of presenters like how they dress up, how they present their menu, their things, whatever.  So, when - after that when we eat the meal it was much good.
