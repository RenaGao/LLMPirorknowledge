Hello there.  I was just - I just left the restaurant because my - my friend couldn't stand the smoking in the restaurant even though it was a smoking restaurant - smoking allowed space.  Um, we didn't have a chance to finish our meals and I would like to have my refund from our meals back please. 
Well, we had to leave because of my friend but we hadn't finish our meals yet and I would like to have some sort of a compensation for that.
No, I was smoking and my friend wasn't happy with the smoke.  So unfortunately you know we had to leave the restaurant.
That's correct.
Well, it is a smoking allowed space, however the smoke was invading everyone's space in the entire restaurant.  There is no way to sort of cordon off certain area of the restaurant for the non-smoking people.
Well  
Well, I think it's really very sort of unacceptable that - that we all have to be subject to smoke because of this one small group  
Well I think this - I am very unhappy. I am not going to recommend this restaurant.  If we can get some sort of a compensation for maybe a half priced coupon for a meal  
Well, I don't know what to say.  I mean this is very unacceptable.  I don't think I'm ever going to return here.  I am definitely going to give this restaurant a bad review.
Well, I am definitely not coming back and I'm very-very disappointed with this restaurant.
That one is tricky because that specifically states it's a smoking space.
Yeah.
