Hi.  My friend and I was recently there and  .
Um-hmm.  And we were enjoying our meal, but we asked to be placed at - at the nonsmoking booth, but it was very close to the smoking booth.
Oh, okay, I see.
I see.  I misunderstood.  I thought it was like a steak joint or a barbeque grill.
Oh, I see.  It's just that, umm, we were not aware of that.  We came there for  .
We were just walking around Yelp reviews and your place was the - the one that was  .
Closest?
Yeah, we - we didn't really finish our meal.  We - we wanted to but because my friend had a really, you know, sensitive nose, she couldn't stand the smell of - of cigarette smoke, and we had to leave.
I know but, umm, we were just wondering if you can maybe like refund us.
Okay, well, I mean, we can meet half way.  If I see that you might not want to refund us, but maybe comp our meal it in.
Yeah, but I think you should always first protect your customers.
Well, I mean nonsmokers have rights too.
But yes, but we chose to come to yours.
No, I'm not.
Yes.
Yeah, because I mean I, you know - I want to try something different.
Well, if it was just for me, it would be okay, but as you can see it - it did a lot of damage to my friend.  She now can't eat because she has remnants of - of that smoke smell in her brain now.
I would be.
Probably not.
Okay, well, what about my refund?
Can you at least give me a coupon for the next time I do come because I really did enjoy the meal?
Alright.  Well, I'll be looking forward to that and I'll see you soon.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.
