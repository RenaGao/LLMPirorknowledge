Uh, okay, uh, hello?
Uh, I - I was - I went your restaurant few days ago---
---with my friends.
And I actually have, uh, something to, uh, uh, complain about your services.
Uh, me and my friends ordered a food - food and we start to eat it.
But, uh, there are lot of people who smoke in the restaurant while they are eating.
Which is quite, uh, bad for non-smokers.
And I couldn't find any, uh, smoke prohibited or smoke, uh, area sign in your restaurant.
So, uh, we - me and my friend couldn't bear it's - all the, uh, atmosphere and, uh, the smell of the smoke all around the restaurant inside.
So, we just decided to, uh, get out of there---
---without finishing our meal.
So, I want you to - is there any chance for us to refund it?
Okay.
Right.
Well, we couldn't actually finish our meal perfectly even though it was our favorite and I - with me and my friend are actually very disappointed.  We were, uh, regular customer in your restaurant but I'm worried that you may lose your - your potential customer in future because of this problem that happened to us.
Uh, yeah, the - it's true that we already start our meal but as I said we haven't finished yet and also, uh, in the money that we paid for all the foods includes the, uh, services that you have to, uh, give us, which means all the clients have a right to enjoy their meal in your restaurant but we couldn't enjoy it eventually so I - yeah.
No meal was actually---
Right.
Right.
Uh, yeah it's - you're right that you can't control all the customers but at least if you put a sign or, uh, if you set the smoking area, it - the situation may flows better than now I think.
Well, uh, but the result that we faced is, uh, we couldn't enjoy our service even though we paid, uh, proper, uh, price that you, uh, noted in the menu but we couldn't enjoy the service all, so yeah.
Okay.
