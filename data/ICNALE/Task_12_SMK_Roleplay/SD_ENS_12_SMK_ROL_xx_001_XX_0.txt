Okay, hello sir.
Yeah, I have just left your restaurant because of some situation of smoking there.  And there were so many people smoking and harassing me with cigarettes, so I had to leave and I believe so many customers wouldn't like that idea of people smoking around your restaurant.  I think it's better for you to have a smoking area in your restaurant or you just - don't just allow people to smoke in your restaurant.  So it's up to you to decide on what to do about that.
I understand that you welcome everybody there but I am still telling you that even in the whole worldwide, the nonsmoking people are more than the number of people that smokes, so you have to consider that and understand that not everybody likes smoking or the smoke itself.  So I think it's better for you if you want to keep your restaurant because I might not advise my friends to come and dine in your restaurant, that might even affect your business.  So you have to create a smoking space for people who smokes, and non-smokes - nonsmokers should go to a different place to eat there.
All right sir, if you insist that your restaurant - your restaurant is a smoking place, all is a smoking place, and I would like to inform you that I might not be able to come back to your restaurant to eat anymore.  I might not even advise my friends to come there anymore.
They are not smokers, most of my friends are nonsmokers.
Okay sir, one more thing.
Would you like me to put this on the internet?
All right, thank you very much sir.
