Okay, so hello, I want - I want you to know that, uh, I went - I went to your restaurant a few days ago and I'm not - I am not - I was not happy because - uh, because - uh someone was smoking there, and I get very bad experience.
So, I, uh, really want you to pay back my money.
So, it, uh - as you say, you want to welcome the - the customers who do not smoke, but actually we are, uh, very - uh, we get very bad, uh, uh, experience in your restaurant because we have - uh, we have, uh, got many smoke we do not want - do not want.  So, if, uh - if you do not refund me, I will ask with all the friends I know who do not smoke - never go to your restaurant.
So, next time, I will choose the, uh, no-smoking restaurant, but this time I want you to pay back me.
Okay, but after using the - after use - after using your restaurant, I actually get - I feel like get some illness.
I - I have got, uh, headache, so if you do not pay back me, I will write some bad comments on the blog.  So, I, uh, really want you to think over and over again about the consequence and I do not want you to do the - uh, make the decision we - we both regret.
Okay.
