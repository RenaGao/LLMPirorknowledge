Hi there, this is Mark calling.  I dined at your restaurant on  
You are more than welcome, on Wednesday of this week in table E-4.  And we went as far as ordering and receiving the food, but unfortunately we had to leave half way through the meal because the cigarette smoke was overpowering for my friend and he couldn't continue with his - with his meal.
And based on the fact that we weren't able to consume what we ordered I - I'd like to talk about getting a refund if possible.
Ha, ha, ha, based on having had an unsatisfactory experience I'd like to discuss with you the possibility of getting a refund.
Well, particularly not being able to actually consume the - the food that we ordered i.e. the products that we ordered from - from your establishment.
Yes.
Because in a - in an establishment that sells food, one assumes that you're going to be able to en - en - enjoy it.
He - he wasn't sick but he did feel queasy as a result of so much cigarette smoke.
Yes.
Well, specifically the excessive amount of smoke that stopped him from eating his - his - the dishes he had ordered.
Uh-huh.
Well, were it merely a smoking shop, i.e. where all you did was provide spaces to smoke, I - I might agree.  But in an establishment where you are also selling food as supposedly the primary aim of your business, I would expect at the very least adequate ventilation so that my friend could enjoy his food without being overly put off by - by the smoke.
But surely if was unable to consume the product that I bought for you, then it was not fir for purpose and therefore I would be entitled to at least a partial refund.
I am afraid you are comparing apples to oranges, but I am talking specifically about my - my dish in your - in your restaurant.
Well, all I can say is I'll be making sure all my friends and associates know of your - of your policy and you can expect to hear from me on TripAdvisor in the near future.
Okay.
