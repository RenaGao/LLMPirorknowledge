Good evening.
Yes, I kind of concerned about your - about your restaurant because last time I - last time I entered your restaurant, I did book for a seat there, and the restaurant said that it is - uh, it's not - uh, the restaurant didn't say that, uh, you did not prohibit smoking, which is very trouble me.
Yes, but other restaurant did not - uh, normal restaurant didn't allow for this and you didn't say on your website clearly.  So, that's why I was, uh, calling for you today to ask for a refund.
Yes, but I was booking on the website.  I was asked for you in the web - uh, I was also ask - ask your - one of your staff too if there are any - if there are any smoker around your restaurant, and you - and they didn't say anything about it.
Oh, okay.  So - so, I am not going to ask for the refund, but please next time, put a - put the text on your website so that this place did not - they allow people to smoke in them because there are lot of people in nowaday   that's very trouble with this kind of actions.
Yes, thank you for that.  And that - when the time - I wish that you have an area for non-smoking people too.
Bye.
