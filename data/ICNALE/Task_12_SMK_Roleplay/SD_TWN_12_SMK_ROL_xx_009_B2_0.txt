Yeah.  Me and my friend had a meal in the restaurant and I don't think that's a good experience.  So, I request - I request you to refund.
In your restaurant you did - you did not prohibit smoking.
Yeah.
Yeah.  So because of that me and my friend - my friend and I tended toward the smoke and we have to leave the restaurant before we finished the meal.
I didn't expect that to be that severe - severest.
Yeah and I don't think in the restaurant you did not prohis   smoke - prohibit smoking and there will be - only a few people smoking.  I didn't expect that much people.
So I don't - so I don't have, okay.  I can't persuade myself to persuade you.
It's so hard.
Um, my friend was coughing and he went to the hospital.  
And he went to the hospital because of that and I didn't expect - expect that.
His lung is infected.
Yeah.
I should take something out of my pocket and open it, now read it, yeah.
We have never went to restaurant - I have never gone to restaurant and - in the restaurant where smoking.
Right after, yeah.
