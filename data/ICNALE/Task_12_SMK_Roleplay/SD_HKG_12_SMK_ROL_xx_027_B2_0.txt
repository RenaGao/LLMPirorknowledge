Um, recently we - we have come to - we have - we have went to your - your restaurant, and had dinner there.  But we - we found out that, uh, and at that time when somebody was - was smoking in - in the restaurant and then - then that was - the smoke was so pungent and make - make us feel so uncomfortable, and we - we couldn't accept that and we just left, um, but we haven't like finished all the dishes and then we left.  And I - I think - I think that it's - it's not okay to - to have people like smoking in a indoors area and it will actually affect like the other customers on - when they are having a meal.  So I - I think that, um, and your restaurant should give us an apology and then also we - we want to get the refun - refund.
Uh-hmm.  So are there any other kinds of compensations you can do for us because that was really, uh, uh, that that was really a bad experience and I think if this - if you - you can't change this or you can't give us like compensations, um, I - I will - I will never like go to your restaurant again.
Um, yeah that - that will be fine.  But I - I hope that you can change the policy, um, by have - like separating the smokers and - and the - and the customers that - that do not smoke because I think it will like balance the benefits of the both.
Okay.
Uh, no, thank you.
