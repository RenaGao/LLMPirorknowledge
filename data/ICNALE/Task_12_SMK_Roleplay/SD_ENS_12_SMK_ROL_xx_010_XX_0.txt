Hi there, I recently went to your restaurant and a---  
Me my friend uh, came there - we - we know that smoking is allowed in your restaurant, but after we ordered our food - food we found it really quite unacceptable how bad the smoke really was, uh, and in the end we had to leave the restaurant and before even finishing our food, before even really starting to eat - to eat our food, umm, and I'd like to ask for my money back please.
Uh, umm no actually I smoke fairly regularly, but it was just in that - in your - in your restaurant I literally couldn't even breathe.
Ah, well if I had that condition I'd have it when I was smoking by myself, wouldn't I?
So, I'd like to ask for my - my money back please.
I understand that but I think it would be in your best interest as a business owner to give me a journalist back my money.
Umm, I wouldn't say so far.
Hmm, that's right.  I am a smoker and I felt that way, which is why I am making the effort to call your restaurant and - and appeal.
Okay.
