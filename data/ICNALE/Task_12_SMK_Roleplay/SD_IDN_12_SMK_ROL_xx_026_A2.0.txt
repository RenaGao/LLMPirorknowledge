Hello?
Okay, so I visited  .
Okay.  So, I visited your restaurant recently with my friend and I would like to ask a refund.
Because I and my friend don't feel comfortable there because many people were smoking and - and we really don't like that.  So, we leave - we left the restaurant early and didn't finish our eating.
I didn't.
Yeah.
Because it's my first time to go there.
Oh.
So at that time, many people are smoking.
And the smoke is everywhere.
So, I don't - so we don't feel comfortable with the smell and smoke.
Sorry?
It's - it's before they smoke.   
Yeah.
Yeah.
I actually tried to call one of them but they didn't respond because they are too busy.
Me and my friend left the restaurant.
Oh, so uh, maybe if I can give you a suggestion to - to - to provide a special, like special room for smokers, maybe I think that's better.
Okay, thank you.
Probably.
Sure.
