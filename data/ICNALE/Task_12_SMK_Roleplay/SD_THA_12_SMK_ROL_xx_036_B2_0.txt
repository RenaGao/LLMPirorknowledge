Hello!
Oh, I would like to get the refund.
I book a table with your restaurant, but I did not know that your restaurant, uh, allow people to smoke there, and my friend, she couldn't stand with the smell of cigarette there.  She - I am afraid, she would be sick.  And still, I - we - we haven't finished the meal.
Yes.
Oh, but I wasn't informed that you restaurant allow people to smoke.
Oh!
I thought you might provide us some space or some area that people do not - people didn't smoke, but I was wrong.  I did not know that all people there would, um, continue smoking and smoking.
Okay, uh, I think that's reasonable.  Um, okay, next time before - I mean, whenever I go or I eat out at the restaurant, I will check first if they provide nonsmoking and smoking area.
Okay.
Okay, fine.  Thank you.
