Uh, sir I am under customer of your restaurants.  So, uh, since I found your restaurant, uh, very good and a very - in a very good environment, but yesterday when I was there with my friends, I saw some people smoking, so I think that's very bad habit and I just left my meal in the middle and I came back, so I - I request you to please give me my money back.
Uh, I think I was there because the - I liked the environment of your restaurant.  So, I had meal at home, but I was there with my friends - with my female friend, so I think our society don't allow to - uh, don't allow smoking at public places like hotel, so I think...
Uh, I think since you are living in a very civilized society, so you must follow and, uh, that's why you - I think you have to, uh, give my money back.
As I mentioned earlier that I was there only to, uh, for the sake of enjoyment.  Actually, I was having my kids there and I think I don't want that - uh, to see my kids, uh, in such a places where the people smoke...
...and openly...
...so I think you must give me my money back.
Okay.
Okay, uh, I think your reason is justified, but my reason is that that, okay smoking should be allowed but not openly, like in the - in front of families.  These people were smoking cigarettes - these people are smoking in front of families where there were a lot of childrens and a lot of ladies there, so I think in our society, it is not allowed.
Yes.
