Hi, this is Michael.  Actually, I - I ate lunch at your restaurant.
Yeah, but when I actually say I ate lunch, umm, I ate about a third of my lunch.
Me and my friend went there for lunch because we thought it looked okay and we thought that a - a smoking restaurant would be acceptable because we felt not - not that many people smoke in this day and age.  So we entered the restaurant, we ordered our food, and there was   not so many people smoking at that time, and then just after our food arrived at our table, about a group of about eight or nine 20 to 30 year-old men came in and sat at the table next to us and they all started smoking very heavily, and the smoke just completely covered our clothes, our meal, and my friend who has but - not asthma but difficulty breathing sometimes around the smoke, she just couldn't deal with it, and we basically immediately had - had to leave.  I ordered the sausage and eggs, and there were three sausages, I only ate one of them, and my friend had the hamburger with fries, and she only ate 3 - 3 or 4 fries and we - -we had to leave.  So I'm really calling you to wonder if - to ask if I could in fact get a refund for the meal  .
Right.  Have you had this type of complaint often?
Right.
But you know the way the vote is going, smoking is seen in a very bad light and  .
We are trying to discourage smoking because it has been proven to be bad for the body, so  .
I don't quite understand why you are trying to encourage everyone to be sitting in the same place  .
I just - I understand but I completely don't agree, and if I'm not going to get my refund, then let's just end the call here, and I will not be visiting your restaurant again.
Thank you.
