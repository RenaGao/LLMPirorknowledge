Hello.  This is the owner of the - this restaurant?
Um,  ...
Anything.  The sea food restaurant.
Um, actually I wanted a refund since you didn't have a sign or a sign that prohibit smoking.  So people smoke everywhere, um - everywhere they like and it makes me and my friend uncomfortable to eat there.
You have to put the sign so that people can eat comfortable and---
I want a refund.  So um, yeah, I don't want to go to other restaurant.  I want to go to this restaurant.  So I really think that, um, you have - you must put the sign since the government says that, um, the smoking is harm.
Then I will call to the government.
Okay, sure.
