Okay so.  Excuse me, can we have a refund?
Well, I'm a - I'm a customer on your restaurant and it's real - it's not please seeing that you don't have any rules that prohibit umm, the smoking of cigarette.  And I want to have my refund because it's disres - how - it's disrespectful that you don't - you're not considering with some of your customers have.
Well, I think it's not my fault that you don't have any rules or regulations that prohibit smoking.  And I just hope that you should respect your customers' health or just have a little umm audacity to have a concern for your customer.
