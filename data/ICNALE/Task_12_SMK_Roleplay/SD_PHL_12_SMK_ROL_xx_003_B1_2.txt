Hi good morning, uh...   
I am the customer at your restaurant.  May I just request if you please give us back the money that we paid in this restaurant since---  
Well, my friend doesn't really like the - your area because there are lot of people who are smoking in it.  And we haven't finished our food because of it.
Uh, the problem is that uh, the smoking in your area really is really uhm, disturbing to other people who are eating.  Do you have anything to do about it?
If you say so, maybe next time you can warn other customers to just be aware of the other customers who doesn't really like smokers.
Thank you.
