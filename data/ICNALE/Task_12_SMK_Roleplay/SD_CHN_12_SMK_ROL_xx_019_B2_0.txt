Uh hello, this is, uh, Magela and I've been - uh, I went to your restaurant a couple of days before.
And I'm calling now because I enjoy the food there and I'm calling to complain something.
Uh, as a matter of fact, I've been - I ordered food and I - they - they seem really delicious---
--- but I couldn't - I couldn't enjoy and I couldn't eat it because there were table of people who just smoking next to me, next to me and my friend and we - we just cannot put up with the - the smoking and we didn't even finish our food and we just left. I - I really think that, uh, smoking in the restaurant is really bad idea, and - and not all the people smoking - and not all people are smoking, so, uh, as for, uh, a lot of people who does not smoke, I think it's better that the restaurant, uh, should, uh, prohibit smoking from now, I think.
Oh, and also, uh, I - I just told you that we didn't even finish our food, and we just grab our bag and - and leave a lot of food over there, and we just left.  So, if you can return our, uh, return my money, I would be feeling much more better.
But a restaurant is where you eat and you pay what you eat, but I didn't even eaten, so how can I pay it.
But with the environment there, we cannot even eat, or we cannot - you - you said, yeah - yes, you prepared the bowl, you prepared the plate, but we cannot bring the bowl and the plate outside the - outside the restaurant and eat it, right?  So, uh, you prepared for us but we cannot - we cannot eat it, we cannot enjoy it, so how can we pay - pay for it?
Oh, okay, but, uh, I did have a really, uh, awful, uh, experience at your restaurant, so maybe, uh, you won't return my money but maybe if you, uh, can, um, pack, uh - you can pack some food and send to my home, as an apology, I can accept, I can---.
