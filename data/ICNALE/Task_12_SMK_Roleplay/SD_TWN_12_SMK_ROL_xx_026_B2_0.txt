I will accuse you of - because the law says that, uh, even if you allow the - your restaurant to be a smoke - smoking area, but the law says that even at public space it is not allowed to smoke.  So I think I need to - I - I need refund.
Uh, yesterday. 
With my friends.
My friends cannot tolerate - could tolerate the smoke, so I think - um, and we did not know that - we didn't know that this is a smoking restaurant and half - uh, during the half way of our meals, we cannot continue - we could not continue because of the smoke.
Sometimes, uh, because my - my friends and I just a random passerby and I found this restaurant looks really delicious and like, uh, the - uh, the type of your restaurant is an Italian food we like Italian food so we - we would came in to dine here.  But we didn't find that this is smoking restaurant.  We didn't do any previous investigation like to check Google comments for to search online before.
That's your problem.  You have to know - you have to inform the customers like on the door or on the door glasses that this is a smoking restaurant.  If you cannot tolerate you have - you - you just find another restaurant to dine.
Usually, the law now that it legitimate - it's - it is illegitimate to be in the public space without smoking because it is common sense that public space is non-smoking area.  I think you also know that. 
Yes.
You did - you - your - obviously did not know anything about the laws or regulations about smoking.  You have to have special areas for smokers.
Sure but - but I think, um, apart from that you have to also, um, tell other customers about this is a smoking restaurant.  I think there are lots of lots of people who cannot tolerate the smoke.
