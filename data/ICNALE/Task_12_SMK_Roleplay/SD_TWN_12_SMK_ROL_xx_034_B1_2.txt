Hello.
Are you - are you the restaurant owner?
Umm, it's really a pity to say that I think I need to - you to refund me - refund me, yes.
Because I just sit in the smoking area and you don't tell - tell me so everyone around here just smoking and me and my friends just feel very uncomfortable.  Even we don't - even we didn't finish our meal, we leave.
But I think it - this is your responsibility to set a smoking area and non-smoking area. 
Because it's---
It is very unhealthy for non-smoking person and it is - it will have the unhappy experience that for eating in your restaurants.
Yes, I have eat.
But I have not finished.
Of course not.  We just passed by and just get in. 
So, we don't have the time to check it.
But I think it's - this is your responsibility to tell us before, uh, we---
We don't know.
But how could I know you can smoke and you don't have a---?
But that's your responsibility to tell us.
Okay, alright, fine, that's it.
