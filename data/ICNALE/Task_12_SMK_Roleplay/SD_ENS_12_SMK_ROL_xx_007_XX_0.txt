Hello.
Yeah, excuse me, yesterday we - I went with my friend and I - I was eating my meal but there was too much smoke and we decided to leave the restaurant because we are uncomfortable with all the smoke but we only ate half of our food and I was wondering if we could get at least some kind of refund?
A refund because you couldn't handle the smoke?
Right.
Okay, uhm, yeah but it was not a very comfortable experience and so  
Yeah, I am not a smoker, my friend is not a smoker either. I understand  
Yeah, we understood that it's a smoking restaurant but not that amount of smoke.  It was quite heavy.
Yeah, no, yeah, I guess so it was busy day, so it was my -  I guess it was my first time in the restaurant, and so we were not quite happy with our experience.
Okay.
Okay, I guess I will be taking my business somewhere else.
Bye.
