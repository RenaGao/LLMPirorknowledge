Hello, hello, ma'am.
Umm, I was at your restaurant a while ago with my friend.  But we had to leave, I'm sorry, excuse me.  But we had to leave because hmm, I'm very sorry, because there was a lot of smoke in the area.
Okay, yes, I do understand that.  But may I ask to have a refund on the food?  
Yeah, because my friend and I didn't have the chance to eat the food and enjoy the food because of the too much smoke in the area.  I, I am not forcing or asking you to stop allowing people to smoke there.  I'm just kind of asking if I can get my refund, because my food was full of, it had smoke in it.
Ah, I think it's not possible.  I'm sorry.  But is there any other way we could, we can make things like equal for both you and me as a customer and as a boss so that I may see your restaurant as you know I can go back here, I could tell my friends, you go here, in return.
No, I can, yes, actually, I really need something in return, because I didn't get the service that I wanted.
Anything for the customer, you then have, because you know  
Yeah, but my friend really can't handle the smoking.
Oh, I see.
Okay.
No, I don't think so.
Thank you.
