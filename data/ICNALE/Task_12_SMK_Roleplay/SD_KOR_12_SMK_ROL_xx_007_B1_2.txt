Uh, hello, this is Gabby, a - I am a customer of your restaurant.
Yesterday I went there.
Uh, but I had to leave because of the smell of smoke. 
Yes.  Smell of smoke.
Smoking, so, um - uh, this is not a happy experience this.
Uh, and - uh, uh, I know there is a non-smoking policy in our country and smoking is - should be banned in your restaurant but you did not.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Yes.
You sure?
But I got the video.
I recorded it.
Someone smoking there.
Yes inside.
Inside.
For sure.  I need refund.
That's because I was shocked yesterday.
Uh---
I just leave there.  I - I left there.
Leftover?  No, I just let them be there.
Refund.
No, you call me a liar?
I got clear evidence.
Okay, I'm going to call the cop.
We will see.
Oh, how do you know that?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Good.  Fantastic.
Yeah, tonight is okay.
Yes.
Thank you.
