Ah, I am one of your customers.
Ah, your restaurant is filled with ah, people smoking.   
And my friend is really sick about a, a lot of people smoking.  And I want to request a refund of what we were billed on the restaurant.
Yes, but I, I understand.  But is there any place that ah, people can eat without smoking in the restaurant?
Ah so, we can, and so, can we please have a refund of our meal?
Ah, I personally suggest that ah, you should, the restaurant you have this should have a place where people freely smoke and it's like ah, you are separating people from non-smoking to smokers so that people who prefer to that smoke can have their meal while, while not, while not having, while not inhaling secondhand smoke and people from smoking so that they can have the freedom of ah, smoking while eating.
Thank you.
