Persuade, okay.

Okay.  Uh, um.
...  Okay.  Hello.
Uh, I am a - a customer that recently paid a visit to your restaurant.
And I am calling to complain that your - about - about our dining experience to describe what our dining experience was. 
Uh, when - when I - when my friend and I were having a birthday celebration in a restaurant, uh, we noticed that some - some - there is a guy - there was a guy smoking near - near us and that has, uh - that's mentally effect our appetite.
Um.
So, I - can I give you some suggestions?
Uh, I think you can divide the restaurant like regulate that there is a certain area for smoking and - and - I don't think IND the division case of - of - of this - of this, uh, this XXX .  And I think by doing so we can have a separate dining area and they can smoke and stay along and we can have our great meal without smoke as we want.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I think you should.
