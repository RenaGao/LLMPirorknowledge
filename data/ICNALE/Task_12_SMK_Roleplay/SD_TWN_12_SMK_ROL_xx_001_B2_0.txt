Okay, hi, restaurant owners.  Um, I am the customer and I just came by yesterday.  And then, however, I saw the - I saw the - the ads that says your restaurant is not - is - is prohibits smoking.  However, many people smoke.
But it's not - but uh, how - however, uh, you say you prohibit something and then you should, uh, strongly mistreated all the people for smoking.  That's why the restaurant should do.  You should not, uh, you should not violate all the people's right like me and my friends.  We dislike the smell.
However, I think, um, it's not the point that I knew something.  It's the point that I knew something was wrong.  I know smoking in the indoor is wrong.  So, I think maybe you should improve sometimes and - and you should pay back my refund.
However, uh, I think you are the restaurant owner and you should be responsible for the food that you serve.  However, the smoke like, the smell of the smoke is totally all over my food.  So, when I eat my food, all I can taste is the taste of smell.  So, I think it's - it's not the responsible, uh, for - it's not the responsibility of a restaurant should do.
