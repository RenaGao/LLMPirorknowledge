Hello ... Okay, hello.
You know, I want to get my money back.  The reason why because your restaurant is not smoke - is not - not - no-smoking area and I don't like smoking.  The reason I don't like smoking because something - something wrong with my - with my lung and my friend say, he couldn't stay with - with the - stand with the smoking.  Even we - we didn't finished our dinner here.
Okay, have you seen a law recently that was saying here something that was everywhere with the XXX  where cannot be smoking.
There are some issue - issues to - to state with the smoking area and no-smoking area here. 
But you know - but - but you know here, the people who decided, if they have the right to decide if there is smoking or non-smoking.
You never said - you never said that you - you have - you are not a no-smoking restaurant but at least you have put some poster to say we can smoke here, and that - that moment when I see this post, I won't go to your restaurant anymore. 
I don't have the time to - to - to - to visit your website here and when I - when I passed your restaurant, I decided to go to in here but I don't see any poster in your restaurant here.  That was your problem.
Okay.  I'll say when I ..., okay when I decide to go to Japan last week, I was with my parents and my family to - went to Shanghai and we visited a lot of something very famous place here and as the night - I don't know exactly where we left at the restaurant, I felt very good, because with my whole family here and decide to send me to Japan, we - we say goodbye at Shanghai.  And - and then I feel, how you say, I feel - it's not the first time I was to live in - leave Japan - leave China, my hometown and to another country and then I feel my parents, how to say, they feel a lot of something, they don't want me - don't want me go, but they decided to let me go, you know, that was very complicate - complicate the - the most thing.
