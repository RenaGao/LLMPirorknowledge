Okay, uh, first of all, I would like to say that I am not quite understand about this kind of, you know, uh, request for refund, uh, but I would like to give a try, and I will start.  Mm, uh, I have like some reasons and I will just start it.
Uh, first reason is I do think - even though you are restaurant which is not forbidden cigarette smoking, you have to give a different area for customers to choose if they are not smoke - like not smoker or who smoke - who smoke.  And the second reason is I do feel uncomfortable and I do have the, um, great experience in your restaurant, you know, eating because, uh, the, you know, apparently it's because your - uh, like your - your - your - your - your part - your restaurant's mistake, so I would like to give you a refund request.
And the third reason is, mm---
Okay.
Yeah.
I - I - it's unbelievable because I do feel uncomfortable and I tried to give a little breath and come in, have my dishes complete.  Uh, for normal people, I think it's unacceptable.
No, because I am not quite understand, yeah.
