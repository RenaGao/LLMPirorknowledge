Uh, hi, I am your customer.
Uh - and at the last week I just eating at your restaurant - I ate at your restaurant and they have smoker - they have so many smoker here so my friend and I cannot stan - can't sta - couldn't stand anymore and so can we get our money back?
No.
But I think - no, I didn't see the sign.
But sometime you need to respect another customer, you need to provide smoking area for the smoker, not in---
In the restaurant, yeah.
So maybe - maybe you should separate zone and for the - for smoking customer and non-smoking customer.
Because we cannot find another restaurant, uh, here.
