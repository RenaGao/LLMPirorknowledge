Hello.
Is this, uh, Ms. Chen.
Um, last week I went to your restaurant and there are many - there were many people smoking.  And me and my friends didn't finish our meal because of that cigarette - cigarette smell.  I don't think it's - it's, um - it's reasonable to smoke in the restaurant.  Why don't you - why don't you stop them and - them smoke in that restaurant.
Stop them - stop them.
So, you - you think that others - others customers who don't like - who don't like that cigarette smell they leave
Yeah, I checked. 
Last week.
And me - me and my friends.
I checked, but I don't think that - I don't think that it's really big problem.  But when I went to the restaurant, wow, that cigarette smell is really bad and I - me and my friends didn't finish that meal.
We just went into the restaurant, yeah, and we felt that if we just leave then we will, um, do some chance to have a good meal.  But you know that men - those - those men who smoking, uh, really interrelate - in - interrupt our meal.  So, I don't - I think you need to give us some, uh, make-up deal to---
Yeah.
Why?  They are smoking and--- 
No, it's not good food, you know, with smoke, why it's the good food?
Yeah, for others you - you cannot let them smoke in that restaurant.
It's a restaurant.  Why can they smoke in a restaurant?
Yeah.
But then you eat my meal with them. 
But I didn't finish my meal.
So, how can you, um, say, can just post or post some warning on the wall that they then stop smoking.
Yeah, I think I need to you know give you some sugge - suggestion that your restaurant cannot - cannot smoking - can really - it's not good situation.  It's not good - good environment for those who cannot bear - who cannot bear the smoke.
Yeah.
