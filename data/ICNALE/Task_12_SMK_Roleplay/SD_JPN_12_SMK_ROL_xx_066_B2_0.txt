 Uh. Umm. I want a money m --- I want a money --- umm my money back, because  
 Umm. Uh. Restaurant is a place we have special dinner and wonderful dinner. So, restaurant should be clean and should be comfortable.
 But your restaurant uh allows customers to smoke. So, it is not comfortable for us and it is not uh clean.
 So, your restaurant should stop allowing its customers to smoking   and uh you should uh pay back the money to the customers who suffered from the smoke.
 I think you should have uh informed customers that your restaurant huh allows customers smoking. So, we never knew that information before I --- before we go there and --- and then uh last week got suffered. So  
 Uh. First --- uh I have two reasons and first, uh, I never --- we never knew the restaurant is a --- and we are --- we knew that your restaurant has allowed customer smoking, but we never imagined that --- uh we never imagined that much customers smoke and almost we ate dinner in the smoke. And umm second, we heard that your restaurant has a good dinner.
 Uh. But umm --- so the --- according to the two reasons, especially the first one, uh, I want you to refund us.
 Uh. Then, but you should have uh informed more --- uh more bigly, umm, more largely to the customers uh umm uh, uh. Yeah, I think your policy is good. But I think you should do more uh --- uh, you should do more --- uh you should do something that uh non-smoker people can enjoy in the dinner without the --- without suffering the smell or the smoke --- the smoke.
