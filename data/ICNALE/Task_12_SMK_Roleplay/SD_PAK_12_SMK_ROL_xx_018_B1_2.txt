Uh, but sir you have to pay it because we didn't have our lunch completely.
Yes, meal.  Uh, because - because of the smoking.  Everyone in your restaurant is going to smoke here and that is too much humidity.
Yeah.  In mostly the restaurants have written there that it's not a smoking area.  Smoking is allowed here.  Mostly restaurants give the permission you to smoke.  But, uh, most - uh, in most of the restaurants I have seen that there are separate places for that purpose that is external and exceptional to the eating place.
Sir, it's not a legal thing that you are doing that.  You are allow - allowing the people to sit there in the lunch or eating place and they are going to be taking - having smoking.  That's not a legal thing actually when you think about?
Sir, it would be---
Yes.  Uh, let's make an deal.  I'll give you an option that if I complain against you to the food authorities, that could be more harmful to you.  And at - and at this position I also need money because we have to take meal at some other place and my friend is getting more serious about that situation and you can return my...
Yes, it's not unlawful thing but lawful thing - anyhow lawful thing is that you are allowing - allowing them to sit in the people place where they are having their meal.
Okay.  I'm going to - uh, I am going to complain against you to lawful authority.
So, uh, that would be fine.  They could do you more fine than the expenditures we have.
Yeah, I'm leaving but we can't sit here.  It's not our ability to sit here anymore because I mean, where there is smoke, how can we eat in smoke.  This is the situation that you can sitting in a road in between the road and try to eat.  How can you eat?  If you are given to any meal and say you can ask to sit in the, uh, between the road and ask you to eat, how can you eat.
Thank you.
