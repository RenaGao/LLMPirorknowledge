Uh, hello, um, today I went to, um, eat, uh, in your restaurant---
Uh, and, um, but, um, when I, uh, eating and a customer, uh, smoked in your restaurant and my friend can - uh, cannot endure the smell and we leave your restaurant.  Um, uh, so I - in - in that time I haven't enjoying the food and now I want you to, um, pay bank  the, um, money for me.
But in China, the law is, uh, uh, they have law to, uh, prohibit people, um, smoking in the restaurant and then you not, uh, follow this law. So if you don't, uh, pay bank  the money to me, I will, um, may come forward to the, uh, involved - um, involved XXX  uh, involved, um, uh, department to say about this.
Okay.  But law is law.  If I, uh, make the phone to the department perhaps they will - they will not let your restaurant continue XXX  - uh, continue having the business.
Okay.
