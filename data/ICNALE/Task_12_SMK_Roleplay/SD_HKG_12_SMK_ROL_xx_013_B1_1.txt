Okay.  So, um, excuse me, are you the owner of the restaurant?
So, I would - I would like to complain about that yesterday I have came to your restaurant to have a dinner, however, because of lots of people are smoking, it makes me really uncomfortable and feel sick of it.  And now I didn't finish my dinner, but I have already left.  So, could I have the refund of that dinner?
Um, I know that it might be difficult for you to refund the whole meal but I would like to have some compensation of it, because it wasn't my - wants to leave the restaurant before the - the meal have came to my table but because of the smokes in the restaurant I could not - evens - I could not even see my friend's face clearly, so I think this was a problem of your restaurant and your restaurant could not provide me another better place of like having less smokes there or some like outdoor sit, so I - I would like to have some of the compensation of it.
Because for my friends that it has the nasal allergy so because of the smoke in your restaurant yesterday when - when we left your restaurant we directly went to the hospital because of her sickness.  So, eh, I think this was one of the case that I would like - that I could let you to do some compensation for - for us also.
Eh, I am not asking for a refund for now but I just some compensation or some action you could done to make us to have a better dinner for next time in your restaurant only.
