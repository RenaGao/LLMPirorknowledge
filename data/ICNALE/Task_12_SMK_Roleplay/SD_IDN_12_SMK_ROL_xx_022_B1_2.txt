Okay. Good day sir.  I am sorry to  .
I am very - I am very sorry but I think you should refund my money now?
Yes.
Actually I - I - me and my friend was   there and we know that that your restaurant is uh
Yes, is a free restaurant and you did not prohibit smoking there.  But you know that this smoke.
Has disturbed me and my friend meal time and I would like to ask you to refund my money because we don't get the best service you can offer.
Yes.
No.
No.
Okay, so - but you didn't exactly put a, how do you say, notice---
---on your wall that stated that if any of the customers find it disturbing having a meal with smokes around them, that you should tell the employee to move your table somewhere else.  We don't know that you have that kind of policy in your restaurant.
Okay.  I understand your point of view.  But please consider this, I am going to file - I am going to post it online about my experience there and how you and how the restaurant is not actually uh persuading the customer to talk to the employee if they ever find any comfort - any discomfort there.
Okay.  Alright.
