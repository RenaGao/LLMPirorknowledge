I am a customer who ate dinner with my friends at your restaurant.  Okay, can I help you something?
Yes, today, uh, someone smoked in the restaurant and me and my friends just went out to, uh, because we don't like the smoking person.
So, I want you to refund my - my fee.
Yes.
Um, then you mean it is okay to, uh, that I may your report your restaurant to the city hall, you may pay the penalty.
No.
I just left the food and went out your restaurant.
But, um, the smoking went out to the very area and I smelled it and I really don't like the smoking.
Maybe...
Mmm, okay.
Yes.
Uh, what?
Okay.
You should inform your XXX .
Okay.
Bye.
