Hello.
I want to tell you something.
I didn't like the - actually normally every restaurant will have a - will have a prohibit - will have a smoking prohibiting - prohibition, but at your restaurant, you don't have any - any signs to - to tell customers and I didn't like the way you - you - you run your business, you run your restaurant.
I see - I see many, many customers smoke in your - in your restaurant and is influenced to other people that don't like that smells of smoking.  You see?  Do you see that?  It's very - it's very bad for their health and their - their emotions, their - their feeling for your restaurant will be down and they won't - and they don't want to go here again.
Yes, you mean you are happy, but you are happy with the only group, the only one group of people that like smoke - smoking, but you never think of other that don't like smoking.  You should, uh, divided some area for smoking.
Oh, so next time, I - I - I won't go to your restaurant again.  And I will - I will criticize you other page on Facebook that you didn't - you didn't pay attention to others customer feelings.
So, for okay, I - okay and so do you think that you should refund for me as for, uh, because I don't like it and you can say for customer---
Okay.  But I won't go to your restaurant again.  It's very bad restaurant I ever had.
No, I won't come again.
Okay, bye-bye.
