Um   um, hello?
Yeah, I recently ate in your restaurant and - and I have pretty bad experiences, uh, people smoke around me and I had a pretty bad time with my friend back then.  So, uh, I want a refund.
Um, uh, well, I think that like, uh, the - the entire Hong Kong right now prohibits smoking indoors, so, uh, I don't know why your restaurant didn't prohibit smoking for some reason.  So, uh, I really think that before me making, uh, an - another move, you should give me a refund right now - or - or maybe like, oh, I would just say, make a bad review on you.
Well, I, uh, maybe - I mean other than a refund I think you really should prohibit smoking because like, uh, it is a really bad habit and, uh, and as I said entire Hong Kong, uh, uh, all the indoor area shouldn't smoke so, I - I mean you should prohibit that and it - it is really bad for people so, yeah, we should ban that.
Uh-hmm, yeah, all right, then but uh, uh I appreciate that that you think about reviewing your policy then.  Thank you.
