So, I have a - I have a - I have a problem here.
Uh, your restaurant is not prohibit smoking, right?
Uh, I will say it's - it is really bad because all of the customer in your restaurant is smoking but - and I can't even breathe in your restaurant.
But if you say freedom, in democracy, freedom is - yeah, you can do everything but you cannot make other people get in trouble like this.
Maybe, you just divide - divide to - to the section on - divide into two room.
I will say they - they have to commit---
Most - most, uh, nonsmoker, they don't like smoke.
If they come together, they have to make a deal if - I think they cannot - they cannot - they cannot sit in the same table.
Uh, in my - in my opinion, let's - let's move the smoking area to the outdoor.
Or - or you just have to - to install the - the -   the air management - air managing system like, uh, some pipe or some fan to - to try to reduce the smoke from the - from the smoker.
Uh, I - I don't want that now, but I just suggest to - you should do it, not - not in short-term, maybe the long term, it's good for your restaurant.
It's okay.  It's - it's not all your fault.
Okay, you're welcome.
Thank you.
