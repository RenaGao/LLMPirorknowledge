Uh, it just happened recently that I along with my friend went to your restaurant, and a lot of people were smoking over there and so it became unbearable for my friend to eat in such environment.  So, I would like to have the money back that we spent on the food there.
Two days ago.
Oh, I - I wanted to do that, uh, that very day, but, uh, I just got, uh, you know busy you know.
But we did not eat that food.  We just have left immediately.
Because my friend was feeling uncomfortable in that environment.
People were smoking...
...uh, while sitting there and he just happens to have a very allergic reaction towards the smoke.
I understand that, I am not asking you to change your policy.  I am just asking that you should give our money back as we did not eat the food.
Because we ordered the food, but we did not eat it.
We did not touch it even. 
But we returned it as it is.
But he got so nauseous that we had to leave immediately, so we did not have any time. 
Well, uh-huh, I think that we would not be visiting your restaurant again.
Uh, because first the environment isn't healthy and second, you're not returning our money.
Smoking is - uh, it's - I - I won't say that it's bad, but you have to agree that it's unhygienic.
Yes.
Uh, well, it's okay.
Yeah.
