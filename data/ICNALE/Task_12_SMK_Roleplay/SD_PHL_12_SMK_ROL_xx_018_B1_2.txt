So, hello, ah?
I have a complaint about  
It's about ah, heavy smokers inside your restaurant.
Ah, I think you should ah, make a proper place for the heavy smokers, because it, it really affects the health of the other people as well as the smoke also comes ah, to the food.
So, I think it's not that healthy and good.
Ah yeah, but I think ah, it will ah, affect the other people's health.  Ah some, someday I think more complaints will, will be given to the restaurant.  So, I suggest that ah, just make a different place for the heavy smokers.
Ah, I think ah, we should get a refund  .
Because ah, we were not really satisfied with the ambience of the restaurant.
Ah, is that so?  I ah, I just, I just suggest that maybe someday if we went back at least there is already a separate room for the non-smokers and smokers.
Thank you very much.
