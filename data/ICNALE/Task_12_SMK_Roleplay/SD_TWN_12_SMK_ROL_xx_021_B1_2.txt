Okay.  So, um, I am the customer from your restaurant and we just leave the restaurant because so many people were smoking and we just can't continue our meals.  So, I think you have to refund - refund us.
Because you don't - you don't post, uh, like poster that your restaurant is not prohibit smoking.  So, we don't know this and we just walk into it.  So, I think you still need to refund us.
Um, I came here because I want accommodation and I just want to try your meals but your - your environment is really bad.
Because the customer - the smoking customer came after us.  Yes, it's - it's not your - your say that when I was entered the restaurant and then many people smoking.  Some customers - smoking customer is came after us.  So and I - I tried to avoid the smoke so I sit in the corner but still the customer came after us just sit around us.  So, we can't avoid the smoke anymore and we can't stand for it.
