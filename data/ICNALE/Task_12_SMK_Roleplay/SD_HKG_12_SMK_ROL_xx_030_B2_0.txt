Um, hello, um, I am the customer.  Yesterday, uh - yeah, last night, um, we went to your restaurant for dinner but then, um, I had a really bad experience because, um, all the customers are smoking in the restaurant which, uh, makes us very sick when we are enjoying our dinner.  So, I think it is not good for us, it is a really - really bad experience so could you please, um, refund to us?
Um, okay.  But I think I should suggest you that it is really bad to have customers who smoke in the restaurant because the second-hand smoking can really affect, um, people's health so I think that even you - uh, it is okay that you don't refund to me but I think you need to change your policy that, um, you should stop people move - uh, smoking in your restaurant.
So, how about you can divide your restaurant into two parts; a smoking part and a non-smoking area.  So, like you can make the - customer who smoke - who like to smoke outside the restaurant or like so near to the window so that, um, the second-hand smoke may go away.
Oh, thank you.
