Okay.  Um, hello?  This is, uh, Stephanie and my friend and me went to your restaurant to have a - have a meal and we don't really - really don't - we can't enjoy the, uh, uh, your restaurant service as my friends didn't, uh, uh - can - uh, cannot, uh - uh, no, no, no.  My friends, uh, can't, uh, it's fell - her felt uncomfortable about the smoking.  So, uh, I am going to request for a - you - eh, give me some refund, uh, maybe refund or some pay - pay me back the money, so because, uh, the - suppose restaurants to have a - a - have the right - uh, have the - not right - have the responsibility to make us, uh, uh, enjoy your service and your meal, but we cannot enjoy it as, uh, you didn't forbid the other peo - uh, other customer to, uh, smoke and we really cannot, uh, enjoy your meal and other, uh - because of your poor en - environment.  So, uh, I think it is really reasonable and - uh, to - uh, ask you to pay back our money, uh, after your full service.
Um, can you, uh, give us, uh, some reasons why as I really need to know?
Um, I have no choice at that - at that time because my friend really can't, uh - really uncomfortable about the - the smoking smell, so, uh, I have no choice but to, eh, gone, eh, to leave - left at the time being.  So I am calling you about that and I am asking to repay the fund because, uh, this is, uh - I - I cannot choose at that time, so I think it's reasonable to pay me back the money.
Uh, I can accept this, uh, thank you at first.
