 Uh. Excuse me; I went to your restaurant today.
 Yeah. And I --- I was just disappointed that many uh customers was --- were smoking and that's very --- that smells bad and I --- I would like you to uh stop smoke in --- in your restaurant and I uh I went   your restaurant uh together with my friend.
 And uh he --- and she said uh she can't --- uh she can't stand the smoke anymore. So, we uh, uh, go out uh your   your restaurant uh and we --- uh before we finished the uh lunch. So, uh, please uh give me back the uh cash or cash back --- cash   today's food, yes.
 Yes.
 Yes, umm, I see but --- uh, uh, but uh you have --- restaurants should uh --- restaurants should uh, umm, uh take uh --- take a responsibility for customers to uh spend a good time in your restaurant. Is --- is it not --- is it --- uh I think it's duty for you to make   environment for customers to spend a good time.
 Uh. But uh in your --- but --- and when I --- when we went uh in your restaurant uh most of the people --- most of the customers smoked and too much smoke here and uh if uh, uh non-smoker customers entered, uh, they all --- and they all say uh they can't stand uh to stay there. So, uh, you should care about non-smoker customers more and more.
 Umm. I agree uh, uh, I see. Uh. Uh. So uh but today, it's uh, uh --- I --- uh we couldn't uh enjoy your restaurant uh. It --- uh is it --- uh I think it's uh your responsibility to uh ref --- uh give --- give uh back money uh, uh, if customers can't uh enjoy your restaurant.
 Okay.
 Yes.
