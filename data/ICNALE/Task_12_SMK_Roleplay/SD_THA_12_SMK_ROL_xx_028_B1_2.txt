I need just---
Yes.
  okay, uh, hi, is this, uh, Chef's Corner restaurant?
Yes, uh, well, I went to have a meal last night and what if I said I was not quite satisfied with the service.
Well, it's not something more with your service actually, but the atmosphere in this restaurant last night was not quite pleasant because I saw many people smoking and it is - I am signing it also it make - uh, the mood to eating dinner, having a wonderful dinner dropped down and I was not quite satisfied with that.
Okay.  Uh, uh - well, so I cannot ask for the refund, right?
Yes, I understand that, but, uh, I suggest that, uh, what you are doing right now is - will affect negatively in your business in the future, so I want you to try thinking it again and make a new policy.
Right, so, uh, you are okay with your business right now?
So, well, I guess I am not your type of things, so I just leave and tell others not to come.  Thank you.
Bye.
