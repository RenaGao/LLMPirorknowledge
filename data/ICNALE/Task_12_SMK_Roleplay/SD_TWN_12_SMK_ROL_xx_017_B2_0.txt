Okay.  Thank you.  You are the - uh, okay.  Excuse me.  Are you the restaurant owner?
Yes.  I have to - I have some - I have some question to - to - to, uh, inform you.
Okay, since, uh, uh, last week I - I - I went to the restaurant to dine - to do - to dine with my friend - to dine with my friends.  But the smoker   inside the restaurant was really strong, and I can't XXX   with this.  So, we don't finish our diets and we go out the restaurant.
Yes.  But it's - it's so overwhelming for me.  So, I can't stay anymore.  But I think if you are the restaurant owner, you must took   care about your customers' health, about their lungs.  So, I see it's not really a good idea to allow people or customer in your restaurant continue to smoke.
But as you know, it's - it's not - it's - if you go in a public - public - public venue to smoke since the regulation has not allowed people to smoke in a public.  So, maybe you need to - to change your rules in your restaurant.
Or am I - am I to suggest some friend not to go into your restaurant to - to - to dine - to dine anymore.
Experience?  Uh, there's - I went to a restaurant with my friend.  It was really, uh - a really nice experience since atmosphere there was really - it was really - really, really, really, really relieving.  Yes.  And the meals there was really delicious.
And scrumptious.
Yes.  So, uh, maybe - maybe in a restaurant, I - I will - I will - I can chat with my - I can chat with my friends, uh, and spend some times to interact with each others for fun.
So, the experience to a restaurant last time was really, uh, memorable
