Hello, this is a restaurant Touch?
I'm speaking to the owner?
And, uh, I have been to your restaurant  
A while ago but I'm not finishing my meals because there's - there was a guy smoking near me so I'm very uncomfortable.  And now, I want you to refund my money.
Because I didn't even eat your food.
Yes, because I didn't eat your food that you prepared for me because the environment is not very good for me.
Um, you have to - you have to talk to the guy that's smoking around the area to go away from the place.  That's what I need because the place where we eat needs to be comfortable, not with the smoke because it is not very healthy for the health.
XXX  .
Okay.
