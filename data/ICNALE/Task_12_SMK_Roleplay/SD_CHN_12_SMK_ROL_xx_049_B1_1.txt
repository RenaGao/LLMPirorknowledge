Well, hello miss, mister or misses, can you hear me?
Alright, I'm a customer of your restaurant and I have experienced, uh, a bad treatment.
Alright, I went to your - your restaurant, uh, lately and there are so many people smoking.  Uh, they - they - uh, the - the smoke is on air and I don't think it's - uh, it's okay for us to eat so we - we just went out with - with the food on the table.  But - but I think it's not okay for us to pay that - pay that now, so I - I want you to pay back - to give my money back.
Free lunch or free dinner?
Uh, I don't think it's a good idea.  Uh, I am a - I'm a stubborn person as I friend XXX  , so I think the - uh, they are two different things, you need to give my money back first because, uh, it's your restaurant not forbidding - uh, forbidding the smoking that a - uh, that created a better environment to eat so that's all - I like to say that's your fault so I need my money - my money back.
Uh, outside and there are no tables and chairs, where - where would you like to - where would you me - where would you like me to sit?
Okay, thank you.
