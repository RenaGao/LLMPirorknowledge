Uh, good evening.
Okay, sir.  Thank you.  First, my name is - oh sorry.  So today, later   today I ate there with my friend in your restaurant.
Yeah and I - I think I am really, really felt uncomfortable eating there you know.
Yeah, because there is a lot of cigarettes and also smokers there you know.  My friends have asthma and he - and she can barely stand for it.  So, we have to go home early while we haven't even finished our meals yet.  So, I would like to - to refund our money back to us because it's very, very uncomfortable service from your restaurant.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I watch the sign there that there is no like no-smoking or smoking area.
So, I was to guess that if you - if you don't want to refund my money and then you have to make a smoking area or so.
Okay, I think yeah it's - my money is not really, really much I think.  So, the most important thing, maybe another people feel like that, that they don't like when the smokes are everywhere.  So, I think you should really, really consider that you are making a smoking area in your restaurant.
Oh we don't   do that.
Okay.  Thank - thank you for your suggestion but at that time that there your restaurant was very, very crowded.
So I can't find which one - no, no, I think the waitresses are very, very busy, then my food came a bit too late.  But, it's okay.  I just want you to know my complaint and I think I hope you consider my complaint.  
Okay.  Thank you very much.
