Sir, we were at our - at your restaurant...  
The other day and when we were there, there was a group of people that were smoking right near our table.
Yes, unfortunately my friend has asthma and she was not able to stay in the restaurant.  We had to leave early and we did not finish our meals.
Yes, we are hoping that we could get a refund.
Because we had to leave.
Yes.
We had to leave the restaurant because my friend was wheezing.  She was having an allergic reaction to the smoke.
Uh well, we were just hoping that you would be kind to us and that we would maybe... 
Okay.
We were just hoping that we could get our money back for the meals that we paid for that we did not get to eat.
Okay, well thank you very much sir.
