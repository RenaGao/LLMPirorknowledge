Okay.  Okay.  Hello, is this the restaurant owner of XXX  .
All right.  So, ah-hmm, me - my name is Farveen.  So, me and my friends we both went to your restaurant yesterday and then, ah-hmm, there was some people - I am sorry.  Ah, there were many people smoke over there.
Okay and then it had caused me and my friends to be, ah, to be very - to be very, ah, to be uncomfortable.
And so we had to leave your restaurant.
Yes.
So, I thought there is a law that says that people should not be smoking in a restaurant.  So, why are the people smoking in your restaurant?
Yeah I would like to request a refund for me and my friend as we had to leave your restaurant.
Yes.
Because ah-hmm we couldn't stand the smell and my friend also had like asthma.  So, she couldn't like breath near people who smoke and then we weren't even finished with our food yet that time.
