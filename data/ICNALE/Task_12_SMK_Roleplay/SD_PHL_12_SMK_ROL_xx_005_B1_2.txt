Uh, I would like to have a refund for our meal because a lot of your customers makes it uneasy for us to eat our meals at your restaurant.
I think there are a lot of customers that are smoking within your restaurant.
My friend really has a hard time breathing whenever he smells the fumes from the smoke.
I would like to have a refund for our meals because we haven't finished it yet and we - we already leave disappointed at the other customers.
Sorry.
Okay, point taken.  But may I ask you for suggestion or---
Actually, there is.
May I suggest that you should separate the customers who are smoking or like have them an area where they can smoke all the time.
And another area for non-smoker customers.
Okay, thank you.
