Um, hello.
Um, I'm a customer just, uh, having meals in your restaurants, but--- 
Um, this evening.
Yeah.
Uh, I found that there are many people smoking in the restaurants and it really influenced me and my friend.  So, my friend cannot stand the smoking.  Uh, but we did not finish the meal, so - and we think it's not right to smoke in the restaurant.  So, uh, maybe, uh, could you just return the funds?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, because we did not know that restaurant - uh, people could smoke in the restaurant.
But you know the policy, it did not allow people to smoke.
It's a non-smoking policy in the public space.
Yes.
Sure and I think it - I, I think---
So, when the - maybe the people from government, uh, checked in your restaurant and they didn't say anything?
Okay.  So, maybe, I will call the people in the government to check.
Sure.  You know, I hope everyone in your restaurant have good time.
