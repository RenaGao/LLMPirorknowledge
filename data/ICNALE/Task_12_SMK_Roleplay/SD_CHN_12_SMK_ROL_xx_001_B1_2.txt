... uh, hello.
Are you - are you the owner of the restaurant?
I'm - I'm a customer some days before and I want you to refund my money back.
Refund my and my friend money - friend's money.
Because in your restaurant, there - they can't speak in your restaurant and my friend cannot - cannot - um, cannot, um, smoke that - cannot, uh, bear the smoking.
And we have - have - have to go out of your restaurant during the meal.
... But - but smoking is bad for health.  You should not let people smoke.  It's not a good thing.
Yes, but I think your restaurant food is very tasty.
So, I come to you restaurant but, uh, all the people smoking.  I can't, uh, eat the tasty food so I think you should let everyone to - to eat your food - tasty food and not let them smoke.
Um, but when the people smoking, it can influence other people who don't smoke.  Maybe, you should divide smoke - smokers and non-smoker to different areas in your restaurant, so they both can eat your food and not, uh, in - influence each other.
Yes, um, ... um, but actually, um, it's not fair for the people who don't smoking.
Yes, thank you very much.
