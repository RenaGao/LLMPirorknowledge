   A few years ago I --- I have   a dinner at your restaurant  .
 But, many people were smoking there.
 So, we --- we can't   enjoy the dinner because of   smoking.  
 I want   to pay back to us the money.
 I think it is your responsibility to make the customers enjoy the   dinner, but we totally can't   enjoy the dinner.
 So, I was very, very frustrated.
 But we --- we can't --- we can't see   the expression of non-smoking was   small, so---
 The   the money we pay   at dinner?
 ��4000  .
 Yes.
