Uh, I call from your restaurant.  There are some people who smoke in your restaurant.  And we - we didn't like this situation and we want you refund to us.
But I think it's not - it's not good that, you know, uh, smoking is not a good thing for other people in your restaurant but why you allow them to smoke, uh, just the short distance from the other customer.
My problem is that the smoking is, uh, smelling bad and affect to me and we can't eat your last.
Okay, I accept that.
Okay, it's my fault.
