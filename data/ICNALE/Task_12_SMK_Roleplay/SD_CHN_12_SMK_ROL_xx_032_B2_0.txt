Uh, this - this evening, I spent some time, uh, to have a meal in your restaurant with my friend, but I have to say I am quite angry about this experience and I want my money back.
I have to ask you first.  You know, uh, in our country, we have a policy that we cannot smoke in public place, but why your diner, uh, do not - uh, does not forbidden that?
So, you prefer to earn much more money but not care about your customers' experience.
It's not reasonable, why I have to, uh, stay outside just because I cannot stand the smoke.  It's not reasonable.  You should have a policy to forbidden smoking in diner, so I have to say my parents and I have a really bad journey - uh, really bad experience in your dining, so we want our money back.
You just okay?
