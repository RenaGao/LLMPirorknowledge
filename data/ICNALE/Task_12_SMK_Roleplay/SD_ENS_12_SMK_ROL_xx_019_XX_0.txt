Yeah, yeah, listen I called your restaurant about a week ago to make a reservation for a date with me and a lovely woman.
Um-hmm.  We were extremely impressed with - with whoever we spoke on the telephone.
And the menu sounded terrific along with the prices.
So having been given everything we needed to know, I did make a reservation and arrived there two nights ago.  However, I do have a complaint to make.
Yeah.  When I made the telephone call, I wasn't informed that your restaurant went by the name of Smoker's Paradise.
Yes, it is.
Well, my - my date at the time and I for the token were not - unaware that this was not going to be a nonsmoking designated area, and she suffers from asthma, and ended up having an asthma attack during our meal, and unfortunately, we had to leave as much as we liked the meal.  And  .
So I'm calling to ask for - for a refund.
Yes and because we weren't informed that it was Smoker's Paradise.
Okay, and why do you think that?
He he he, well, as you know, this is Australia and not having a non-designate - a non - non-smoking designated area is illegal.  Are you well aware of that?
Yes, but it's illegal for people to be smoking at the table.
Since when, yesterday?
