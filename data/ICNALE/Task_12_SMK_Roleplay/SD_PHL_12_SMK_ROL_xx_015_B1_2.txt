Hello, ah?
Well, this, about your customers in your restaurant, I just want to, to ask, I would, I just would like to request if we can get your money, our money  .
We, we have been in this restaurant earlier and we noticed  .
Yes.
And we noticed that there are lots of smokers.  We can't eat properly in the restaurant.
Since we are, we are suffocated by smoke, because there are lot of smokers in the restaurant.
Yes I understand that.  But as a, as a, a manager you, you should also, you should also understand that not all of your customers are smokers and they are being affected.  Their health are being at risk if you will allow these smokers to smoke inside the restaurant.
Well, if, if you will allow your smokers to smoke in the restaurant, then you, you could ask them to smoke in a specific area or in a designated area rather than smoking everywhere, because not all smokers are, are responsible enough for, for with the health history of the other smokers.
Well, if that's your, if that's your, if that's your opinion, then I will respect it.  But I also want to know, I also want to, to come back someday in your restaurant and I want to see some improvements.
Thank you.
