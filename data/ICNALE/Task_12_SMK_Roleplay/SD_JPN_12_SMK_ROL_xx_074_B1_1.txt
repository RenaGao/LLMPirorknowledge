 Hello?
 Uh, when I --- when I went to your restaurant.
 But there are a lot of smokers, so I can't enjoy the meal in your restaurant, so I want to return the money.
 But uh I think that because of such a smoking, I can't enjoy the taste of the meal.  
 Uh, I think the meal is real --- really important things for the life too.
 Maybe that such a smoke will be the --- will be the bad effect to such a meal, so I think to return is good.
 But I think that is not good oh because of the --- because of the smoking, that some --- someone can't enjoy the some restaurant, it's not so good and if uh I think for the --- if you want to welcome the many people, you have to make the, for example, the dividing room to smokers, that's a responsibility for you.
 No smoker and non-smoker can't agree with the opinion to smoke or not smoking.
 Non-smoking people can't --- can't --- can't endure to such kind of the smoking.
 I don't say to ban is good.
 I think that to dividing is good --- dividing is good.
 Yes.
 Thank you very much.
