Earlier in this afternoon I have gone to - to your restaurant and have my lunch, um, and there are some people smoking in your restaurant and it is - the smell is not good.  And we can't bear the smell and so that we go - we left your restaurant but we haven't finished our meal so please refund to us.
Because your restaurant should mean - should be able to provide a comfortable atmosphere for us.
Because we haven't finished our meals.
But you can't provide a - a favorable, uh, atmosphere for us to have that food.
So, maybe, you can set up a smoke-king area, not - not, um, having them with us.  And - and because of that smell we can't have our, uh, meal.
Maybe, you just have to, uh, refund to us because the - the environment is really, really dirty and smelly and if you don't, um, um, refund us we may, uh, tell this story to the news company.
