So, last day   I went to your restaurant.
Yes.  I think the meal is very good but---
--- so the um - so the situation of customer is not so good.  So there a lot of people smoking - were smoking.  So, my friends cannot enjoy the smell.  So, we also - so we decided to go outside as although I wanted to enjoy my meals.  So, I think that I am -I am satisfied with - with your meal but the smell is bad - smell is - smell of smoking is not so - is not so good.  So, I want you to lend my - I want you to return my money.
But I think there are - there were too many smokers, it is not - not so good for a lot of customers.  Maybe some customers cannot enjoy your - your meal.
But I think that um we really wanted to enjoy my - your - I enjoy my meals, so but we cannot get good memory.
Maybe if you continue to do like this action, the number of customers will increase - will decreasing because I think other people want to enjoy the meal not - not want to enjoy smoking?
So, I have some - I have something some thought at solving this situation.  I think you should separate the - separate the area; one of the area is for the smokers, one of the area is not so smokers.  If you so, I will want to go to the - I want to go to there one more time.
So, in that time, I think the people - the - they want to - they should go to the smoking area and people, all the people non-smoking and non-smokers should go to the non-smoking.
Thank you.
