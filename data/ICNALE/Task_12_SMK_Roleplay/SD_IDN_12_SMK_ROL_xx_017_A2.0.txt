Ah, okay, ah hello.
Yeah ah, I am the one of your customer.
Uh actually, I want to give you some input, because I have ordered some meal from your restaurant.
Uh actually, I want, I wanted to dine in on your restaurant but too many people smoking on there, it's a bit disturbing for me and my friends.  So, I - I decided to go home.  But I didn't take my meal yet.  So uh, can you help me to give me some compensation - compensation.
Yeah, compensation to me.
I think I - if you - if it's possible I like to you give me a refund.
Uhm, I hope you can make a - make a spare room, I mean you provide a room for smoking, smokers, and also room for people not doing smoking.  I think it's better because you know for some people smoke could be so disturbing.
Yeah, I  
Yeah, I even didn't have any meal.
Yeah.
Uh, no, not yet, but we decided to go to home.
Okay, unfortunately, but I can understand your explaining.
Yeah.
Yeah, thank you.
