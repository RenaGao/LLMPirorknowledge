I think the - the restaurant don't prohibit smoking is wrong because there are so many people don't like smoking and - and also don't like, uh, the second hand smoke - smoke.  Mmm, as a restaurant, uh, you didn't - you don't - you don't support, uh, good environment and service.  So, I think you should, mm, make the money back.
