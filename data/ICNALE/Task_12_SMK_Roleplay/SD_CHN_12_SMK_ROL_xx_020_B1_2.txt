Uh sorry.
... it's very hard to say.
Hello, and I - I had the - I had the meal - I had the meal yesterday in your restaurant.
And, now I'm not very happy and very angry with something.  Do you know that?
You really know that I need to mention you, the smoking.
Yeah, and yesterday, I - I can't really, uh, stand for the - for the smoke - this - this smoky and even not finished my food, and--- .
Yeah.  So, um, oh, ... so you know why I called this phone to you?
Yeah.  I think you should give the money back to me since I think it - I think yesterday's food is not worth for that.
Oh, okay.  I will, yes - actually, I didn't understand there will - there will be so smoky in your restaurant.  So, maybe, I will give, uh - give a writing comment in your - in your website.
Will that be alright?
Just the truth like---
