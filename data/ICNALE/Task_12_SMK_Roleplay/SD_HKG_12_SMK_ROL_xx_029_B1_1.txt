Um, eh, yesterday I and my friend go to the - your restaurant to have lunch and my friend is some kind of, uh - hates the smoking and we leave early and we haven't finished the lunch.  Can you please, uh, refund the fees for us?
Hmm, but we haven't finished our lunch, you know, and your restaurant didn't mention to stop the smoking.
Hmm.  Maybe   you can refunds half of the fees because we haven't finished the lunch and - and my friend had a bad experience in your restaurant.
Um, yes, that's do.
