Hello, may I speak to the restaurant owner please?
I'm one of your customer tonight and I would like refund.
On my food because we had to leave earlier because of your - your - because of people smoking in your restaurant.
I did and I do have a picture of it.
Yes, I am.  I was at XXX   restaurant and your worker did not, um - did not take an action on those people who smoke, so I want a refund.
Yes.
It's either you give us our meals back or give me my money back.
All right, thank you.
