Hello, I am Nee and I just walked - uh, I just take, uh, reserve - reserve, uh, in the next - in the last Sunday, and we have been to your restaurant.  And I know that, uh, your restaurant is, uh, not - no-smoke, uh, restaurant, but there are so many people smoking in your restaurant at that time.  So - and my - and my friend, he - she has a sick, so she can't - uh, she can't stay there anymore, so we - we - we haven't finished our, uh, dinner.  Uh, but you just take my - take our money, so, um, asking you for - uh, for this money, uh, return to us.
Yes, but I - when I, uh, book a seat, I said that I need, uh, no-smoker, uh, seat, so I think maybe you should to provide a - a place that for us, uh, like, um, the table beside us is a no-smoker, like that.
Maybe, it's a good idea, but you know that we - we didn't finish our, um, dinner.
But the dishes haven't been put on the table or - so how about half of the money you have to pay back for us?
But why don't you just, uh, make that dishes, uh, for takeout for us?  Why don't you prepare for us?  You know that we just angry at that time, so?
