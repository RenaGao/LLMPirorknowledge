  Hello my name  . 
I am a guest at your restaurant  
A few - a few days ago.  And I went to - into your restaurant.  I know it is prohibit smoking.  But me and my partner are quite bothered by the - the smell of smoking and I think - I think it is not - it should I should be - you should be pay any pay - you should be pay - paying back. 
Yeah. 
It is one of the reason, yes.  But - but I want a refund because - I do not want a refund because the - because the - because the - I - I want a refund because I did not finish my meal. 
I did not finish my meal because I had to leave for my friend having a health problem with smoke. 
Okay.  But actually I have another reason.  Your food, it should be smelled like a cheese melted in a chicken, but instead it smell like cheese melted by cigarette.  It is not like a flavor of cheese at all or smelled like cheese at all, but it smelled like a cigarette. 
This is a service problem.  You said and mean there are - this is a chicken melted in the cheese.  This cheese sausage in the - on top of the chicken and it should be flavored and aromatized like a - like a cheese.  But on the - but for the fact it is like aromated in cigarette. 
At that time there are no onsite managers and  . 
Yes I - I protested to one of the employees.  But they said that it is just the way it is. 
I can identify.  He is a blond man with earrings on her - on his - on his right cheeks. 
Okay -okay.  I can - I can - I can attend your restaurant.  Actually, I am in front of your restaurant.  So can I come? 
Okay.  Thank you.
