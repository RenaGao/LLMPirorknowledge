Uhm, hello?
Is this the restaurant manager?
Okay, thank you very much for your taking  
Alright, the owner, excuse me.  Thank you for taking time to speak with me today.
Uh, I went to your restaurant earlier today and unfortunately - well the food was fine, unfortunately, the atmosphere and the actual - particularly the cigarette smoke was just so heavy that we just could not even - we couldn't take it anymore.  We had to - we just couldn't even finish our food.  It was - it was just overwhelming.
Uhm - 
Well I - of course I have all the paper - I have the receipts here for what we ordered and I have photos of our - like taken there with my smartphone of the food.  We couldn't even get in to our meal really and I just would like a refund for my friend and I, just for the meal that we ate, because we just could not enjoy the meal whatsoever.
This cigarette smoke was making every - was making my friend particularly very, very sick.
A smoker's paradise?
Uhm, I mean, that's fine, ,uhm, I myself l do smoke but I choose to smoke in separate or spaced off areas.  I'm perfectly fine with allowing people the right to smoke if they want.  But is there anything like we can separate so that people that want to smoke could be over where they'd like?
Oh, uhm, but we would like to enjoy your restaurant's food  
As the menu was very good and the food quality is fine, it's just the atmosphere itself that's a problem.
Is there any possibility that your restaurant could allow people then to smoke in a larger space or another part of the room?
Hmm, that's understandable but for someone that maybe doesn't want to smoke or doesn't want to deal with that  
Well, I'm sorry, then, your business really can't flourish as much  
Under smokers, but you are cutting off an entire another part of the possible customers, that's a huge deficit I think.
Alright, thank you.
