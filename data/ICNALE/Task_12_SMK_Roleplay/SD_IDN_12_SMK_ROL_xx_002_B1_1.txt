Hello.
Okay.  So, like, I visited your restaurant before.
But because of the smoking something, we cannot finish our food because we cannot enjoy our food like in a very peace way.  So, can I have my money back.
Because I feel like we have no fresh air to enjoy our food.
So, I think it's you can - I think it's really necessary for you to refund my money because I cannot enjoy my meal like in a very peace way, in a very convenient way.
Uhm but you say that it was uh you - you will guarantee all - all of your customer convenient and why do - why can't you do like take my money back.
Yes, I do.  But they just.
They just say that it's not a non-nonsmoking restaurant and they just care about the - the food quality.  But I mean customer convenient also is very important for a restaurant if they want to get more customer.
Yes, but this - but I mean your restaurant and I prefer your restaurant for our meal but like the service is not that - that good.  So, yeah because of the smokers and something.
Still, I still can like smell the - the - the smoke.
So, it's still not convenient for us.
But the healthy   of the customer, you need to like consider about that.  Like we all need fresh air and enjoy our meal for that.
Okay.
Okay. 
Thank you.
