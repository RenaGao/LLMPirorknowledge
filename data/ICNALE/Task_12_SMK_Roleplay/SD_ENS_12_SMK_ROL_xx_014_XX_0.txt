Hello.  Your restaurant is - doesn't separate the smokers and the non-smokers and I have a friend who um, cannot you know enjoy or we cannot finish our food because it's just too heavy with too many smokers in your restaurant.
Okay, how about the right of the nonsmokers?
But they haven't told us before we entered the restaurant that um, this is - it's mainly a smoker's restaurant and we just ordered our meals and now we cannot eat them.  I want my money back.
No, the staff didn't explain to us as we entered the restaurant.  There are no signs that it says it's for - it's a smoking restaurant. 
Well, I didn't see any signs outside and you should make better signs so we would have chosen a different restaurant.
Do you have a non-smoking area separated in your restaurant?
Could you please um, refund our money and we will be on our way otherwise I don't want to take this to legal issues.
In Japan it's a very strong right that they - they - they separate restaurants and people eating food to separate the smokers and the non-smokers.
