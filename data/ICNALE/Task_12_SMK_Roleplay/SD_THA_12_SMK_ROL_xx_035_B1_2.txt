Okay.
There are so much smell of cigarette, I can't enjoy my food here.  I require refund.
Then, you have to think about the people coming here.  You should think as a service, not - not just your opinion.  You can do that to your customer.  
If they do what you want to do, how about the others around then?  You want to lose your customer like this?
I can do this.
That is acceptable.
Welcome.
