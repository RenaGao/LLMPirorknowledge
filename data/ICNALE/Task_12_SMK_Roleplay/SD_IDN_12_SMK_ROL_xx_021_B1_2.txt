Hello.  Are you the owner of this restaurant?
Actually, I came to your restaurant and I feel why - why there is so many people smoking in there - in that place?
But don't you think you have to like divide them from this - this place for the smoker one, this place is for not the - non-smoking place?
But do you think that this country want to like make the smoking people not smoking again like the place they smoking is less and less.  So why don't you help the country I think?
Actually  
Actually, when I visited your restaurant, me and my friend, actually because my friend cannot like smell the smoking---
Yes, the smokes, we - we leave the restaurant.
And we not---
Yeah, we did not finish the meal, so I think you can give me money back.
But I think because many restaurant prohibit smoking or they have different place of the smoking one and not smoking one, I think your - your restaurant also not smoking one.
Yes.
But I think because there is no - no like announcement that we can ask the waiters and etcetera, so I just left.
Okay, then.
