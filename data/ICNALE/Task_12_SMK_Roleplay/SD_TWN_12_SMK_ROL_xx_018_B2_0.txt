So, I went to your restaurant to have a meal with my friend last week.  But because your restaurant didn't prohibit smoking, so my - my friend and I, um, didn't enjoy our meal last week.  So, I want you to refund our fees for our meal.
Because I surf on the Internet and many customers say that your restaurant is really good.  The food is very delicious.  So, I choose your restaurant.  But my option didn't satisfy me.
I - first time I stepped into the restaurant and my friend and I want to leave but we walk around - sorry.  We walk around and found all the restaurant nearby are all full with people, and they didn't have empty table for us.  So, we still choose your restaurant.
But your environment is really bad and my friend and I didn't finish our meal and we left.
Um, I had a meal with my friend last summer.  And we went to a restaurant that I found on the Internet.  And the restaurant sell spaghetti and some pancakes.  So, we went there and the clerk is really friendly and she served us in a good way.
