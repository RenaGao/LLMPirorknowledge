  Hey, owner, do you know Hong Kong is a place that prohibit - prohibites  , uh, smoking indoors.  And it is so unreasonable that your restaurant is still allowing this uncivilized act to happen - to be happening in your restaurant.  And my friend is not comfortable with the cigarette's smell and she vomits for several times after eating in your restaurant.  I don't think it's the problem of your food or I think but it will - it is the problem of the cigarette.  So, I request you to refund us the, uh - the money and apologize to us.
But my friend is suffering from vomiting for the whole day and very - feeling very ill for the rest of her noon.  And I believe it is doing some kind of, uh, you need to refund her - compensate her in some kind of way at least, not in money is okay, but you have to compensate her.
Not if - not if your restaurant have a - stopped the smoking as for - uh, of all the customers.
Okay.
