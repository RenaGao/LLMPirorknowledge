I'm in the restaurant, I'm a customer.  I would like to get a refund.
For the food.
I was ordering two dishes for me and my girlfriend and I wasn't able to stand the cigarettes.  There was a lot of people smoking and I really didn't like it, so I didn't finish my dish so I want to get a refund.
Well, but there is some regulation nationally.  They cannot smoke in public places and you also have to put ���no smoking' sign in the restaurant and didn't even government have notice about it?
Well then---
But I can tell you that there's - there must be a ���no smoking' sign and people are smoking there and you have to manage not to smoke there but you didn't and that's your fault and the atmosphere in your restaurant just made me and my girlfriend so mad so I really want to get a refund.
Well, then I'm going to ask for the National Customer Service about it.  If you want to get a hard time when it comes to business, well, it's on you.  I can't - I'll just go for it the customer service.
That's all.
