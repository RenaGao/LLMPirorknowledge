Good afternoon.  Uh, I have a bit of a complaint to make. 
I was at your restaurant this afternoon with a friend. 
And we were - especially my friend was bothered with the - with the - with the tobacco smoke.  She had an - an allergy and - and we had to get up and leave the restaurant.
The problem is - is we - we paid for a meal which we couldn't complete because of the amount of tobacco smoke that's in the restaurant.
We feels it's - it's not our fault for - for leaving the restaurant and we would like to be able to give other people a good recommendation for your restaurant but we can't do that since unless - unless you pay for our meal that was interrupted by the smoke that you allow there.
No, I am not.
No, there is no sign out front.
But you realize that these days smoking in public is - is  
But yes, it's a restaurant that's open to the public  
---and as - since you are open to the public you're causing people who don't smoke a problem.
Well then you should have somebody at the door that tells people specifically that if they can't accept smoke with their meal they shouldn't enter.
But that doesn't - that doesn't forewarn anyone.  It may be who knows may be your name is smoking - Bill Smoking I don't know.
Well, then I am afraid I am going to have to go and talk to the government official who is - who licenses your restaurant and make a formal complaint and I will go online and get a number of other people who will have - will make this into a bigger situation.
Thank you.
