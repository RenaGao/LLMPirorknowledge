Hello, so my name is Mica and we went over to eat at your restaurant  
---and thank you for letting us eat at your place by the way.  So unfortunately, me and my friend we went into the restaurant and we tried to eat but there was too many people smoking and my friend unfortunately wasn't able to stand because of so many smoking and he had to leave and we weren't able to finish our meal.  Is it possible that we could get a refund for our meal?
Yes
Okay.
Okay.  All right.  Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
