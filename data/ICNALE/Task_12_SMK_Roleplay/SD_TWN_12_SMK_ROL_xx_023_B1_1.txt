We are the customers of your restaurant but we didn't have the meal yet bec - because we can't stand the smell of the cigarette, so can you pay - payback of - of our - of our bill.
Because my - um, at first I don't know this is - this didn't list or this restaurant didn't - didn't - didn't allow - didn't quit smoking.  Uh-huh, so, so I - so my friend and I choose this restaurant but now we - we think we can't stand that.  So, we - we had to go.
But I think I - I didn't eat your meal, uh, uh, and I - and your - I not saw I think you - and you can still have your meal and I take my money.
Or maybe we can take home.
