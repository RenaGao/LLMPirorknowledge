I think there - there is - there - there - I think for a non-smoking person, the restaurant is need to be, uh, area that is non-smoking area because not every person can endure the smell of cigarette.  Uh, but your restaurant, there is not non-smoking area in your restaurant.  So, I think my friend and I cannot endure the - the smell of cigarettes.  So, I need to leave this restaurant.  But we haven't finished the whole meals yet.  So please just - please just return our - our meals - meals, um, oh, please just return our money
