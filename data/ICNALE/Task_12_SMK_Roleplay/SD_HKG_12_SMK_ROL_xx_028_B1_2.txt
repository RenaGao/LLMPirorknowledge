Okay.    Okay.  So, um, the other day my friend and I went to your ho - your restaurant and then, uh, there were so many people smoking that we just can't stand it anymore so we left.  And then we didn't even finish our meal.  So I think that you should, uh, refund to us because, uh, restaurants are supposed to be a non-smoking areas according to the government rules, the laws, yeah.  So, uh, now that you are not, uh, stopping your customers from smoking, I think that you are doing a really bad job, and so, um, if that affects - given that it affected us I think that you should refund to us and, uh, compensate our loss.
Well, uh, but then, uh, we didn't finish our meals so that means, uh, we are - we are not enjoying what we should be enjoying given that we have paid the price of that meal, so, uh, maybe you should make an exception.
Well, but then, uh, the smoke is just so strong that we just can't stand it anymore and that's why we left.  So, uh, we couldn't even spend more time to talk to you, so that's why I am making a phone call now.
Uh-huh.  If you give us a discounts but then the other customers are still smoking then what's the difference.
Okay.  That sounds good.
