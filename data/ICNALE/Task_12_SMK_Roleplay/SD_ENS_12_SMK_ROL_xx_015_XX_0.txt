Um, hello.  Me - my friend and I went into your restaurant the other day and  
Yes, um, and while the food was good we were very  
---disappointed in the atmosphere itself.
And because of it we weren't able to finish our meals - our complete meals and we would like a refund for the meals.
Ah, my friend really detests smoking and um  
Yes, it is weird isn't it?  Um, but um, you know, I am going to write you a bad review on Yelp if you don't refund the money and that's going to be pretty bad for your business.
All right.  That didn't work.  Okay.  Um  
Yes and my friend should have noticed that but she didn't because she is blind.
She never told me that she didn't like smoking.
No  
Yeah.
