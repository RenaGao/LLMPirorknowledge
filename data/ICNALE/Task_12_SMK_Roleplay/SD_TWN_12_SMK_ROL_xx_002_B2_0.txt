Um, I want to ask you to, uh, pay back the, hmm, the cost of our meal yesterday.
Because in your restaurant, so many people were smoking and, uh, in a public place, it is not allowed to smoke and we can't stand the smell there.  So, we needed to leave the restaurant and---  .
But more than three people means public place.
But your sign is not legal.
Uh, in law, it is - it says that, um, more than three people or the place more than three peoples can't smoke and, uh, if they want to smoke, you can make a smoking place for them, not smoke inside the restaurant and make us be, um, not comfortable and have to leave the restaurant early and---  
Um, mmm, but we don't   feel uncomfortable at first, but after staying there for a few minutes, we found that, um, smelling the smell of smoke make us ill and we didn't finish our order.  So, I think you should pay, uh, the cost back to us.
