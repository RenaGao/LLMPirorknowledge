Uh, yeah, when - when we - when we are eating, there is a man sitting near our table, but he - he is always smoking.  So - so the - so the terrible smell made me feel - made us feel very uncomfortable and - and, um - and we - and we don't have - and we didn't have - didn't have appetite anymore.  So - so, we leave the restaurant without eating - eating enough.  So - um, so I want to call my money back, yeah.
Uh, although your restaurant is not prohibit smoking, but, um, some other customers' behavior have, um, influenced us and we didn't enjoy our - our eating, so.
Um.
