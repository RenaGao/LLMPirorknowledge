Hello?  I am Jenivar   and is this the res - call the restaurant.  Can I talk to the manager of the restaurant?
Okay, umm - just a few days ago, I went to the restaurant with my friend and we eat there.  But people - people were smoking so we did not finished eating and I wanted to ask a refund about - I wanted to ask a refund for the food.
I guess you should give me a refund because we did not finished eating and it - and it is not really proper that people are smoking around a restaurant, because people go there to eat, to be healthy.  But umm, when people are smoking around, so it's not healthy to other customers.
