Because, uh, in this restaurant, you did not tell people or your, your need to probably prohibit the smoker to not to smoking in here because this is restaurant.  Restaurant is a, is a food place that you need to eat.  And when your eat, you need, uh, a, uh, a good environment.  So I am not sure if this a good restaurant.
So, uh. I can't refund the food?
So uh I can't refund this because of this situation that you not - you did not - you did not prohibit smoking. So basically your restaurant is, is not as good as I thought, because actually you need to, to prevent the smoker to come to your restaurant because it is not for healthy, the vapor might come to food that eat.  So can I refund it?
I will request or I will report it to the, the from the police maybe because right now you know the restaurant need to prevent smoker, no cigarette in restaurant nowadays.
