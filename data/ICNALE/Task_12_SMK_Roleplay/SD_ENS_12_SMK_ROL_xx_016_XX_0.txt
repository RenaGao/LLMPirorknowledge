Yes, I just love your restaurant and  
No, the problem is sir, during the meal you had people smoking and it really bothered me and my friend so we had to leave before we actually finished.  So can you tell me can you refund our money for that meal?
Well, don't you think that we should have - you should have areas, non-smoking areas in your restaurant, sir?
Well sir, I am going to have to definitely come - I am going to have to come back to you and talk because this is really - this is not good for customers and people coming into your restaurant.  So what - what time can I come over today to talk to you about this?
I would definitely let the bureau know about that and I will make sure that I won't come there again.
