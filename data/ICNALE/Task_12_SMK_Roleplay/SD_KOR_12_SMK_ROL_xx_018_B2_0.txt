Okay, I - I'm a customer in your restaurant and I want a full refund of my meal.
Because in - in front of your restaurant, there it says that smoking is prohibited, but like many people are smoking here.  So, my meal, uh, get ruined very much.  So, I want full refund of it.
I didn't know that there is people smoking, but I realized that people are smoking like far away from my seat and the - the smell came to me when I just had a few - few part of my meal, so.
But in that case, you need to like - then, you have to put like you know, smoking is like permitted signs on your restaurant.  But you put prohibited signs on your restaurant.  So, I think they are not right and so, we are right.  But if you want to keep them smoking or having a time in your restaurant, then give me a full refund, so I can walk away.
Yeah, I fully agree with that, but you know like, when - when people, other people came here and see - see like some people smoking like you know, like other families has their child and if they see this like they might say - they might say like full refund like me or they're just going to leave this restaurant and that's your - that's your fault I think.
I thought I could endure that, because there - as I said, it was just a little far away from my seat and all the restaurant is like kind of air filtering like things.  So, I think that it's not a big problem, but while I was like having a meal there, the sme - smell made me really annoying and like.
Okay.
But I think you have also responsible for like not putting signs, not - or just you put - put a sign on like smoking permitted.
Okay.
