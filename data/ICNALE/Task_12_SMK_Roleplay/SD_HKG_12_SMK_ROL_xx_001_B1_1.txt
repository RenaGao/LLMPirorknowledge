Hello.  May I speak to the owner of the comp - of the restaurant?
Yeah.  Uh, I want to have a complain about, um, um, the day that I come to your restaurant and have - enjoy my dinner, but somebody's, um - somebody is smoking cigarettes make me feel sick.  Uh, under the Hong Kong law smoking in a restaurant is prohibident   so I request a refund, uh, for my dinner because, um, it's affect me to enjoy my time in a restaurant so I request a refund.
Because - basically under the law, uh, smoking is not allowed in the restaurant.  It's not about, uh, where you see the - the restaurant is big enough or not, uh, this is law, it's not allowed to smoke in the restaurant.  It's affect, uh, me to digest the food so and really, uh, I feel sick, uh, of the smell of the cigarette and I can't have fun with my friends and I can't enjoy my dinner in the restaurant.
Yeah, I agree that the food is okay.  But, uh, why I left the restaurant, uh, because I can't stand the smell of the cigarette any more, so I left the restaurant immediately.  The, uh - the customer is smoking in the - uh, near the window but you know the cigarette smell is, uh, is ann - annoying so if you don't like that smell, it - it is hard for you to continue your meal in that - in your restaurant.  Um, I believe, uh, I could get a ref - I think I can get a refund because I don't enjoy the environment in your restaurant.
