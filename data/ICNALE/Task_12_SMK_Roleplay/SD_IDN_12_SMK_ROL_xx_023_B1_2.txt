Hello!
Yeah I am your customer---
---from New School.
I already ordered some foods from your custom - uh your restaurant---
but that place is there is a lot of smoke---
---and I don't like, I don't comfortable with that---
---and I and my friends already going to uh go - going out from your restaurant.  But uh after paying my foods I - that the foods that I am - I don't eating it.
Yes, of course.
You can do refunds, the refunds for that food that I order first because I am not comfortable with your restaurant.  There is less information about your restaurant is a non-smoking area and the smoke that already uh in my food so I guess I don't want to eat the food that already there is a smoke in there.
Um I don't aware it---
---but I see that there is less information about your restaurant is the non-smoking area.
Yeah.  They can't   smoke in your restaurants but I guess my food uh still uh there is smoke in my food and I don't want to eat with my food already smoking there.  So, I want you refund it.
Actually, my food is different with my uh order---
---because the food there is a smoke in there is different that I expecting---
---so I want to refund it.
Uh for that time, I don't uh remember - I don't remember but I guess I just going to out and like uh when I was angry, I don't - I forget to explain to your staff.
Uh if to prove it I can show you the - the - uh the billing statement.
Yeah I remember because I---
Yeah I remember and there is a billing statement that I get - I can give it to you.
Actually, it's wrong order because there is a smoke in my food.
Sure.
Thank you.
