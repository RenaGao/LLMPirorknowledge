   I went to your restaurant several hours ago.
 I want to eat the lunch at your restaurant.
 But many people were smoking.
 My friends didn't --- don't like the --- the smell of smoking.
 So --- so, we --- we must go out the restaurant.
   I --- I can't eat the lunch.
 But I gave the money for the food.
 It is --- that is so crazy.
 Please return the money.
 Of course, you know that there are many people who don't like smoking.
 Otherwise, you don't separate.  
 The smoking area and non-smoking area.
   In order --- in order to not separating the area, we cannot get the good service.
