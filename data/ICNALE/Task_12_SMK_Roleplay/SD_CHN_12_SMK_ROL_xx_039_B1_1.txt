Okay.  Hi.
Is the restaurant only---
Yes.  I am one of your customer and I have something to complain to you.
Several days ago, I went to a restaurant with my friend to have a meal.  But, your restaurant didn't prohibit smoking and there are so many people smoking there and my friend can't endure the smell of cigarette there and we - we had to leave the restaurant and we haven't finished the meal yet.
So, I have to talk to you to refund my money.
Yes.
Mmm, sorry, I just want to have my refund because if your restaurant still has so many people smoking there, I thought I won't have a good feel there.
But, um, I think you can understand that it's really hard for me to control the people who wants to smoke.  So, we have an area outside our restaurant and you can sit outside there and also enjoy the food.
Also enjoy the food.
But---
Mmm, but - but last time we haven't had a good - good experience and I just want to have my last time's refund there.
Next time will be the next time.
Okay.
