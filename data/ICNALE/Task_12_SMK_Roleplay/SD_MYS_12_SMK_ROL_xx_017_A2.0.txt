Okay, hi - ah - I need my refund - ah - my refund back because - ah - I am not satisfied with this - with this restaurant.
Because I - I found out that there is a - there is a couple of people - ah - smoking in this restaurant, so I am not used to it.
But you should - ah - put the sign because it will make other people be comfortable - umm - comfortable with the environment, so I think you should put it.
Because the smoke can - can effect our environment and also the - we - we cannot feel comfortable with the food and also there is  .
So I - whether you refund back my money or unless you must - you must ask the people to stop smoking.
Umm - then I won't come back to your restaurant any more.
