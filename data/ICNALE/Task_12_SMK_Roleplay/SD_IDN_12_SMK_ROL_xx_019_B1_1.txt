Hello, good morning.
Uh, actually, I want to tell you that recently I went to your restaurant and with my friend and I - I am - I shocked that your restaurant is very, very uncomfortable for uh, for customers because there are so many people who smoke there.
It's restaurant, right?
But it's not the right place to have meal there because there are so many uh, so many people who throw the cigarette and there - who smoke there.  It's very - it's very disgusting for us as customer.  Can you uhm, can you pay back our meal?  Uh, can you pay back the meal we had before, because it's really uhm, it's really disgusting for us, because we spend our money there but we don't satisfy.
Yeah.
Yes, I do.  I did.  Because it's not non-smoke, non-smoking restaurant  .
But - but it's very dangerous if you keep your restaurant in that state.
Because there are so many people who smoke there.
Yes, I know.  But as - as uh, as the owner of the restaurant, you have to tell or you have to manage your restaurant very uhm, very friendly for not only for specific people, but general people such as - it's I know it's not non-smoking restaurant.  But you know the people who do not smoke are irritate   with the smoke will have -will, you know, will have another respiratory, respiratory problems  
You know?
He was - he wasn't there.  So I can't tell the man - I couldn't tell the manager about this.  So, I want to tell the owner directly because it's very, very disgusting.
Okay.
