Okay, uh, hello.
I went to your restaurant yesterday.
And I expected different dish and great atmosphere there.
But I had an awful experience in your restaurant.
A - a lot of people were smoking while we are having the dishes.  And we couldn't endure the smell, so we couldn't finish our meals and we have to run out of your restaurant.
Yeah.
Policy?
I couldn't see any - any mention that is - uh, that is prohibiting smoking.  And I also took off many pictures of people smoking in your restaurant.
Yes, do you want me to show the picture?
Yes.
I know.
Mm-hmm?
Yes.
Yes, I saw them.
Smoking booth?  No? 
No.  I really saw then people are smoking while we were having the dishes and, uh, next to our - our table.
They were not in the smoking area.  They were on their seats, eating meals while they are smoking.
Oh I told you that I took a lot of pictures.
Yes.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Nobody was recognized the situation.  But I saw the server was looking at the person who was smoking and he didn't mention anything.  So, I thought about talking to you doesn't mean a lot in that situation, so I took the pictures.
Yes.
Yes.
I want you to refund what we paid for last night.
Uh, I don't know exactly, maybe around $50.
Mm-hmm.
My fault?
Uh, I don't think that was my fault because my friend who was with me last night was suffering from so much headache and some headache today.
So, I think that is - that is never can be my fault.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, since I had a terrible headache experience in your restaurant last night---
---I don't want to go your restaurant again and I want you to post the notice - notice on your wall.
That is saying smoking is not allowed in your restaurant.
Yes.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, then it - uh, this sounds okay.
But managing people smoking outside the smoking box is your job.
Yes.
Yes.
No, you should refund me.  I don't - I don't need to go there again.
That doesn't sound okay to me.
You made a mistake and you should pay for that.
Mm-hmm.  How about this?  Give me a partial refund and make a poster posted on your wall that you have made a mistake.
Then, I cannot never be - never be agreed with you.
Full refund?
Do you promise me?
Okay, then I will go there and I will warn your manager to apologize.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
