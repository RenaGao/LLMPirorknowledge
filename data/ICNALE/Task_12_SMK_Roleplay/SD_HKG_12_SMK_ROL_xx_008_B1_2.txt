Uh, hi, boss.  Uh, me and my friend, uh, wents   to your company and your restaurant to, uh, have dinner, uh, yesterday - yesterday night, and as the, um, restaurant is not prohibit, uh - uh, the - customer are not - were not prohibited, uh, from smoking in your restaurant, uh, many of the customers are - were, uh, smoking when we are, uh, having dinner, uh, yesterday.  And we are so, uh - we - we - we, uh, thought that the situation is very annoying and so we left the, uh, restaurant without, uh, finishing the whole dinner.  Uh, and, uh, I want, uh - I - I want to, um, seek for compensation for my dinner and for, uh, the situation that happens yesterday.  And, uh, because I think the situation really, uh, damaged our health and it's, uh - it's - it is not good for, uh, your company to, uh, allow customers to smoke in your restaurant.  So, uh, I think, uh, your company is responsible for compensating our loss, uh, in this incident, and we are very angry and we need to seek for, uh, apologization for - uh, from your company.  And, thank you for help, uh, in this incident.
Uh, perhaps, uh, your company cannot compensate for our loss.  I think your company should, uh, implement, uh, the policies for not allowing customers to smoke, uh, in your restaurant during they are having the dinner or having the lunch, because it may affects the rights and affect the health with - uh, for other, uh, customers.  And to protect other - protect the rights for other customers and protect their health, I think it is essential for company to implement new policies for prohibiting customers to smoking during the meals.
Uh, I understand the situation.  Thank you.
