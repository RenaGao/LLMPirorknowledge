Okay.  Hi, I'm calling because I went on your restaurant a while ago and I really had a bad experience because I and my friend didn't - didn't finish our meal because of this - this disgusting smoking within the restaurant.  And it's really annoying because my food is being - it smells like smoke and I really can't - and we really can't finish my food.  Can you do something out of it?
Umm, excuse me, you're asking me that kind of question - I'm the customer and you have to comply with me.
You know, why -   
You know what, I'm calling because I need a payback because we haven't finished our meal and at the same time I think I'm getting sick with this kind of smoke within this restaurant.
Seriously?  I think you should because this is really disgusting and I have really - umm, I don't think   we're not going to go back in that kind of restaurant.
