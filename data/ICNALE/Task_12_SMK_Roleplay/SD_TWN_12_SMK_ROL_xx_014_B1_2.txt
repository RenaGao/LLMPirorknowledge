Well, your - your dining environment is - is not very good and many people smoke in your restaurant--- 
---and my friend and I can - cannot stand with this - with that and we have to - we ask you to - to pay the -   - we ask you to have our paying back - paying check back and---
But I didn't - I didn't understand that before and in - in - in our law, the - the rest - restaurant is a public place and you in - you cannot smoke in - you cannot smoke in the inside place.  So, I don't think - I don't think - I don't think your restaurant can just ignore this point.
Well -   okay, maybe - maybe - maybe we have some - we have - maybe we have to did before - did and - did before but I don't - I think your restaurant have   to improve.  Maybe - maybe one time you can have a smoking area in your - you can just set a smoking area and then - and yeah, the - okay.
