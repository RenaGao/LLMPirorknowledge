Um, I am now lodging a complaint that the restaurant hasn't forbidden for smoking and I can't satisfies that the smell of smoke?
Can I just ref - can I refund for the meal of - in - for the meal in money terms or you can - or hand me some coupon in your restaurant that can have - eh, that can - that can have a discount for me.
Um, I understand that your difficulty that you cannot provide any refund for me but according to Hong Kong law, you should end - you must forbidden in smoking in your restaurant unless I call - I may later contact with the department of hygiene about the issue that your restaurant hasn't forbidden for the smoking of your customer that customer.
Um, I - if you can't do the refund maybe you - you can - I think I recommend that you may have the area of non-smoking area that's - to your restaurant or your customer may feel more willing to enter your restaurant with your - with her - her friends that you - that have minimized the smell of smoking, hmm.
Still pressure.
It's okay.
Um.
