Sir, actually when we were, you know, having meal so some were smoking in front of us so my friend have a problem with smoking.  So, uh, actually, we want to leave your restaurant because we cannot, you know, eat in front of all those activities going on in your hotel.  So, please refund us.  We won't sit here, you know, and---
I just want - want to tell you that this is not good discipline for your restaurant and you should improve it.
Yeah, you should stop, you know, all those activities.  If you are allowing people to smoke here, so you should stop it.
I wouldn't pay money.
We wouldn't pay.  This is your punishment.  This is for your rules that you have, you know, uh, bad rules running in your hotels and you should stop it properly.
So, that's one of the problem our friend facing.
So, why - why they are smoking there?
It's not our problem.
I - I admit.  I admit I didn't read it but we wouldn't pay any, you know, uh, your bill because our - our friend is facing different problems, okay, he have problems with smoking, so I couldn't pay your bill, sorry.
I would also have legal action against you.
I'll also go for police.
If my friend is facing different problems and he - he has some troubles, then I will go to police for them.
You feel it is a threat, then maybe it's a threat.
Sorry sir, I cannot pay.
Actually, I cannot pay because the condition of my friend is, you know, very bad.
Sorry sir.  I cannot.
If you have any action, you can take it.
