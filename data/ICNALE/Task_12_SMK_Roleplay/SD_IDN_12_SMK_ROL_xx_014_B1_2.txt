Hello.
Okay, Mr. Owner.
I - I saw in the restaurant there is a sign that we have not allowed smoking, but I find there is a lot of people smoke in your restaurant and I am not comfortable with that.
Okay, but - but I think for - for - you - you have to respect the other there, the nonsmoking people I think.
So, so you have to make maybe a room for nonsmoking customer.  So, so your restaurant I think is not - not good for the people, you have to guarantee our health I think because you have the restaurant.
I want you to refund our money because I - I can't - I can't finish my meal.
Yes.
Okay, if you - you are talking about the food quality, I can say that your food is not good quality because it's the food can - the smoke from the smoking people can trap your food, can get in your food.  So, it's - it's not healthy I think.
Yes, but  
Not yet, not yet.  I just - I want to call you directly.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.  I - I will - I will take your - your suggestion.
Okay, thank you.
