Hi, um, I recently went to your restaurant with my friend to have a meal.  And when we are having our meal, uh, there are, uh, a very heavy, uh, smell of cigarette.  And we can't endure it.  So, we leave your restaurant but we didn't, uh, had our - uh, we didn't finish our meals yet.  So can you - can - can - can you, uh, refund us?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Uh, um, I know that you allow smoke, uh, but I don't know the smell would be that heavy, and it influenced our meals.
