Hello.
Yes.  So, I went to your restaurant earlier.
And there were a lot of people smoking.
And my friend had a - has a health problem, so we had to leave your restaurant because many people are smoking.
So, I want to get my money back.
Because your restaurant isn't considerate to all people.
Yes but not all people.
So you don't accept, like, people who are not smokers.
Yeah, but here we have a health problem.  If you have a restaurant, you should like at least divide your restaurant into two parts, like this one here and---
But my - my friend had a health problem, and we couldn't finish our food, so I want my money back.
You didn't say it's a smoking restaurant.
Okay, so - yeah but my friend has a health problem  
Yeah, but we already ordered our food.
So, what would you do if you were in my place?
Yeah, but you are already there, so what would you do in my place, if you're in my place.
Yes.
Because the food is good.
Well, I came to your restaurant because I want the food, and it's a restaurant, not a smoking---
Yeah, but I went there and enjoy the food, but I couldn't enjoy it because---
But I was already there.
Oh, but it already happened.
Yeah, but I want my money back.
