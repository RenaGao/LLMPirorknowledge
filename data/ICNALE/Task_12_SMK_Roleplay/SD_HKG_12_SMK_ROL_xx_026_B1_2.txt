And, and, hello, my name is David and in last weekend I have a dinner with my friends in your restaurant and - and because my friends they have a bad - they - they don't - and they cannot torture and they cannot, uh, smoke.  They don't - they don't prefer smoking and they really hate smoking and - but in that restaurant there are so many customer who smoke so - and we have a really bad dining experience and we request refunding and also apology to my friends.
So - or at least - and apology because my friends, uh, their health was really affected in that in your restaurant because of - of the smoking customers, so, yeah.  Can you have apology for them?
And one more thing that, uh, even you cannot give us a payback, can we have one step that where both of - both of us can once maybe - we can one step further that we request a discount next time when - and - when - maybe when I come to the restaurant can I have a discount?
So, okay, thank you.
