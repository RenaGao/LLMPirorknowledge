Okay.  ... Well, I really want to see - I had a bad experience in your restaurant.
So, uh, you know, everyone is smoking.  Uh, many people is smoking your restaurant and I can't stand the smoking.
So, I didn't finish my - my dishes and I go and - I, uh, go and - and then I ... - and I go out of your restaurant so I want to, uh - I want to refund both my - both - both me and my friends---
Okay, I see but you know if you - if you, uh, insist your restaurant's policy, you will lose many customers because customers such as, uh, I and my friends will not, uh, go to your restaurant twice so I think, uh, if you refund, uh, and change the policy, uh, the customers will, uh, be more sas - sastifitied  - suffist ---
Okay, umm, even you cannot, uh, refund all my, uh - all - all the - all the money I paid, I hope you can refund half of them because I didn't finish the dishes and I had a really expe - a bad experience.
But the reason I didn't finish my meals is that the smoking in the restaurant, that's a - that's a restaurant's fault, it's not my fault.
Okay.
