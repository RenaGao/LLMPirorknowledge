Uh, yes.  Uh, me and my friend came at your restaurant and---
---we want to have a dinner.  But then we see that there are many people, uh, which are smoking.  And we are allergic to smoking.  So, we don't want to sit here anymore and we want to refund our money.
Yes, sir.  It is my mistake that I, uh, did not notice your, mmm, mmm, that thing.  But now I think, uh, mmm, uh, the - uh, it is, uh, unlawful to be a smoke at public places, uh, because some people like smoking.  You have to make a separate room or separate place so that they can smoke there.  You cannot, uh, uh, apply some people's opinion over a majority.
I think you should, uh, make some specific area so that they can smoke there like, uh, uh, mmm, uh, some kind of open space balcony so they can, uh, also smoke, uh, their, uh, whereas some people can --- 
Uh, uh, look, uh, we - uh, we cannot be sit, uh, here anymore because, uh, we both are allergic to smoking and we cannot eat our dinner in that environment, so we have to go and that is our, uh, money you have to---
So, can we, uh, come at a - uh, at a - at a point that, uh, you can cut that money, uh, in that way that we eat your, uh, dinner? 
But you have to because I think the - your restaurant has a very good, uh, uh, very good image in the public so if we go, uh, there like - like that so---
Uh, it - it is up to you, uh, if you don't want to refund my money but I think that the thing which I specifically described before it is very, uh, some - for some people distur - create disturbance so you should take care of that I think.
