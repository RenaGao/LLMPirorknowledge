Banana restaurant?
I want my money back.  Uh, in your restaurant, there are too many smokers, and I cannot bear for the smoke.  Can I get my money back, and I have never, uh, finished my meal there yet.
But today is too much.  I have tried your restaurant for many times but - but this time, this is too much.  I cannot bear for that.
You - you are a manager - you can do anything, if the customer want you to do.  But this time, I was too angry.  Can you manage this for me, please?
Okay, uh, okay, now I know that is my fault.  So, sorry, but another time I will not go to your restaurant anymore.
Yes.
Okay, thank you, goodbye.
