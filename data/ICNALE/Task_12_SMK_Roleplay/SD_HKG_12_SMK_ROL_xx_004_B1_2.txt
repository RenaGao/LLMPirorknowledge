 .  We - my friend and I have just had a meal at your restaurant, but due to the, um - due to the smell of cigarettes, it's too serious in the restaurant, my friend and I had to leave before we even finished our meal and I will wish to, uh, require a refund from the restaurant.
But the reason we cannot finish the food is because the - um, because your restaurant did not stop the people from smoking and this cause the - the smell of cigarettes to be very, uh - very serious in the area and this is your restaurant's responsibility, you should now refund us.
Uh, but the environment in your restaurants is that, uh, most of the people smoked in the - inside area and not just at the windows or not just outside, so is it - it is a serious matter and the food we ordered, uh - we only had a little of it and we had to go because of this problem so, um, the restaurant should be responsible for this and give the payback.
