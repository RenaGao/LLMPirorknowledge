Okay.  Hello.  Uh, is this the restaurant owner?  Uh, I am calling---
Uh, ah, is this, uh, the Sushi Restaurant Order?
Okay.  I am calling to you because I want to lodge a complaint.  Your restaurant did not prohibit smoking, but - uh, me and my friend, uh, went there to have a meal, and we didn't even finish our meal yet because we had, uh - we had to leave because my friend, uh, cannot enjoy the smell of cigarette.
Ahem.  The thing is, uh, restaurant are not meant for a  smo  uh, as a smoking area actually.  Uh, parents might have babies around them, and smoking would affect the, um, the small children or babies that you brought, uh, that they brought to the restaurant.  What I - what you should do is you should prohibit smoking at your restaurant and more people will come.  And I think that you have to pay us back because we did not finish our meal because of your not prohibiting smoking.
We did not know that you didn't have a smoking, non-smoking, uh, policy.  Uh, we thought that I am, uh - your, uh, restaurant are normal as other restaurants.
Then, I will, uh, complain to, um - then, I will complain to your manager, uh - yes - to get refund.  Or, if not, then I will complain to the XXX  .
Okay, thank you.
