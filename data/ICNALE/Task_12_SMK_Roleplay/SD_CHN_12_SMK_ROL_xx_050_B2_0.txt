Okay, so now there is a case that I and my friend we went to your restaurant last month.  But my friend can - could not endure the smell of cigarettes there.  And we ordered a - a lot of meals, but we had not finished.  So, now I want you to refund and we want our money back because we do not finish our meal.  And we also have some - uh, my friend have some illness of - of the  go to your restaurant because of the smell of cigarettes was very strong in your restaurant.  So, we want our money back.
Um, actually, uh, we want our money back because we do not finish our meals and we think, um, the reason why we had not finished our meals is because the smell of cigarettes in your restaurant.  So, uh, we want a refund of this time and not the next time.
Yes, I would recommend my friend go to restaurant if I get refund this time, because I have to let you know that we could not finish the meals because of the smell of cigarettes last time.  So, I would like to recommend my friends to go to a restaurant if I get my refund this time.
Yeah.
