Hello.
I really feel bad about your restaurant.
Because last - uh, recently, I - my friend and I have a - had been your, uh, restaurant for dinner, and your restaurant haven't often - offer, uh, nonsmoking zone for your customers.  Lots of customers are smoke in the restaurant and the smelly smoking - cigarette smoke, uh, choking others - the others.  So, I just wonder if I can get full refund from your restaurant because I am not satisfied with your, uh, service.
And - but don't forget the customer is the god.  The - the rule is very important.  If you allow the people who smoke and the people who don't smoke, uh, to enter the restaurant in the same area, that is actually not a good idea for your restaurant to - to - to - to keep more repeat and to come back to consume.  And if you can make the area divide into two area, one smoking area and one nonsmoking area, and that will be a better idea for your restaurant.  And if you don't, uh, get, um, refund - uh, refund me, then I will - I ask and maybe I will consider to call the consumer, uh, complaint desk - desk.  Maybe, they will - if they can give me more, uh, uh, help, I will accept that.  If they don't, maybe I will sue you in the law course.
I like your taste in your restaurant---
You open your - often  best, uh, uh, food in the city.
That is why I come to your, uh, restaurant - hotel, but if you keep continue, uh, mix the nonsmoking area and smoking area together, then maybe I think your customer will decrease and I am - I suggest you accept my - my advice and give me the full refund and - and adjust your restaurant rule and make, um, nonsmoking area for smokers and in - want to - in your - in your restaurant.
