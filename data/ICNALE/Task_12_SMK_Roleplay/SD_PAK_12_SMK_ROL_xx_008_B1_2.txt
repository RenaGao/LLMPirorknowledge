What you can do for you - um, for me is that you can come here and put a "no smoking" sign in your restaurant.
Because you are the most competent authority around here.
Yes, I have called you for this thing and it is affecting us.
The smoking.
Yes, me and my friend here, we came here to eat but a man sitting next to us is smoking cigarette one after another, which is making my friend uneasy because he is a non-smoker.
That's why I have called you to come here and stop that person from doing the - doing the smoking.
But then you can come here and return our money so that we can leave.  
Because - but we have not eaten your this food.
Yeah. 
If returning money is not an option at least you can do is that you can pack our food so that we can leave this restaurant right now.
Well, that's a problem then, you have to put - you have to either return our money or you have to put that ���no smoking' sign next time we come here.
Because it's a---
Because smoking is prohibited at public places, and restaurant is one of them.
Because it affects the health of other people sitting around who are non-smokers.
Then, at least you can put them at some corner where they can smoke openly without affecting other people.
Okay, then you must return our money.  If you cannot do one thing, you should do the other.
Because we have not touched your food.
Thank you.
