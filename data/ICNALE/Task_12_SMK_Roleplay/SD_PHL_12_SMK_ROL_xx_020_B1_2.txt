Ah hello, good afternoon.
I just want to report this incident ah, earlier that your restaurant is prohibiting smokers and my friend cannot enjoy staying there.  That's why we need a refund for our food, because we did not finish it and we need to leave.
But my friend has difficulty in breathing when she, she when there is the smoke, cigarette smoke.  That's why needed to the place in a jiffy.  Even we did not finish the food.
Ah, can you consider any other offers that you might give to us, us?
I think I suggest that there is a place on the restaurant that cater those smokers and maybe inside the, inside the restaurant, you will be ah, free, free to no, non-smokers.
