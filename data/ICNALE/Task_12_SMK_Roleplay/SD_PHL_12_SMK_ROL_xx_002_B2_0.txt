So um, hello ma'am.
So we would like to uh, so this call is uh, to inform you that we are - we want to have a refund from the restaurant from our earlier expense.
Unfortunately, the restaurant not prohibit smoking, so lot of people smoke in there.  And uh, me and my friend is not used to that kind of environment, so we left early and not finishing our food.  So the restaurant didn't gave us the experience that we should have.
And the value of our meal is not satisfied.
Uh, even you know maybe we can ask even if it's just half of the price of the payment.
Well, if possible, if you had this kind of restaurant, you should have an open area so that other people can also eat even if they smoke so that the air would circulate and won't disturb your customers.
Okay, thank you.  Thank you.
