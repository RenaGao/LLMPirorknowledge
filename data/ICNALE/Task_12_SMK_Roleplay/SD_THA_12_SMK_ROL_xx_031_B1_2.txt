But we had to stop and leave your restaurant immediately.
As your restaurant allow people to smoke and the smoke that - and there are many people smoking inside the restaurant, and you know, the smoke annoyed me and my friend.  If - I think it's - it's - it's important not to smoke in the place that you have - you - there many people are eating.  Why you - why don't you prohibited smoking in your restaurant?
Uh, yeah, and the problem is that because as I started eating for 5 minute, so I haven't finished my - eat my food.  
No, because when I enter - entered the restaurant, there is no one smoking, but after I sit there for a while like - after I ordered the food, they are just smoking.
All right, okay.  If you are not going to - going to give me a refund, it's - it's all right.
Yes.  And I will - I will remem - remember that your restaurant.
