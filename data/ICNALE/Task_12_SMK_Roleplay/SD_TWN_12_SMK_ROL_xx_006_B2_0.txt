Dear - dear restaurant owner, I think you should give us our money back, because you give me the very bad eating experience and we even didn't finish our lunch.
There were lots of people smoking in your restaurant and you didn't say anything.  You just had them smoking there.
Oh, but I think you can, when your customers have some problems or have some trouble, you can still give some help to them, but you just did nothing.  You just sit there and watch on TV.  You didn't do anything for us.  Therefore, we have to tell your clerk, your workers that we - we want to change our seat.  You didn't do anything.  You just sat and see here.  So, we even can't finish our lunch.
Hmm, but as a - but as a restaurant owner, I think you should know every situation in your restaurant.  But I think you don't know we have trouble there.
Hmm.  All right, thank you.  We don't want the refund then.
