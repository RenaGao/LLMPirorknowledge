So hi, good morning, good afternoon.
Yeah, good afternoon.
Uh, this is a customer that went to your restaurant just a few days ago.
I would like to place a concern because I would actually want to get a refund.
For the food that we paid the other day.
We couldn't enjoy the food actually because there were a lot of smokers and that I - I understand that your restaurant doesn't prohibit - prohibit smoking.  But some people like myself and my friend didn't enjoy the meal because of the smoke that was there.
Uh, alright, but I wish there was another way so that I could be able to---
But it was not a great environment to finish my food.
But then can I just suggest another thing?
Uh, I would like to suggest that you separate the non-smoking and the smoking customers from each other so that there wouldn't be any - any other incidents like this.
Okay, thank you.
