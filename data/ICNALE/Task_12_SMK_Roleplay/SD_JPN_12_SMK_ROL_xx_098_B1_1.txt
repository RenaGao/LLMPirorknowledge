Hello.  I went - I went to your restaurant.
And I ate, I ate with my friend, but I felt too bad about smoking smell, so we stopped eating and get out your restaurant.  And I am not comfortable about your restaurant is not thinking about customers.
So, we wanted to eat to the last, but we - we can't stand the smell, so I want you - I want you to get   back our money for the meal.
I understand your concept but we - when we felt bad about the smell, your staffs don't notice that, notice our feeling, so your staffs should - should notice our customer's feeling.
