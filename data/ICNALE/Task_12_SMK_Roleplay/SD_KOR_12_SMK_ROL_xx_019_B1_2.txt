Hello.
Um, I was a customer who went there with my friend to restaurant.
And I want payback.
I want refund for my lunch and my friend too.
No, I - at first, I couldn't eat all in the restaurant and second, I was so upset about the people who were smoking there.
Who were smoking there.
Yes.
Inside. 
Right next to me.
Yeah, I thought about it.
Yeah, I know that.  That's why I'm so - I feel so upset about it.
Yes.
I just left.
Huh.?
Around 1 pm.
Yes.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.  I talked to one - some of the staff.
But he said that he can't, um, he can't make them stop smoking---
---because they are his customers too.
Yeah, that's right.  I don't like this too, but not your staff.
Do you think I'm an idiot?  I saw the cigarette.
And it's not the - a man.  There is - there is a lot of people who is smoking there.
Maybe they just decided not to go there.
See cigarette, I'm the only one?
Do you have a record cam?
Why, what's the reason?
So, I have to think about the situation.
Press?
Yes, me and my friend.
Yeah, I thought that you know me.
Yes, I'm really familiar.
Yes.
Okay, I don't have.
How do you know that no one else?
You - you wasn't there.
You even didn't know the situation.
Maybe - maybe their customer was his friends or something.
Like I said at first, I want payback.
Mm-hmm.
I don't know.  You should check.
Me and my friend?
Okay and make sure that there will be no people who're smoking there.
And please let them know, the staff in there.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, mm-hmm.
Yes.
Okay.
Good.
No.
Bye, bye.
