Hello, is that the owner speaking?
Well, actually I have a claim.
Well, just a few days ago, I went to your restaurant---.
---with my best friend.
Well, I would say there's no problem with your food because we both enjoyed it, but my friend just couldn't bear smoking.
Well, I think it is - it is really a pity because just because of that bad smoking - just because of bad smoking, we didn't finish our meal.
And we just left and, well, I think we had a very unpleasant experience there.
So, I think it is very reasonable for refund.
Well, what I think it is not impossible for you to set some unsmoking seat, but as we entered the restaurant, well, actually we - we stressed that we don't like people smoking, and are there some unsmoking seat.
Well, because, you know, you serve really good meal.
So, that's the reason why we didn't choose other restaurants.  But I think at least you are - you are supposed to separate the seats, maybe for smokers and nonsmoker - nonsmokers.  Well, I think it is - it is also good for you because as a matter of fact, some of my other friends, well - well, because, um - some of my other friends - well, they are - actually they wanted to go to your restaurant to enjoy good meals, but after hearing that your - you're not unsmoking restaurant, they just give up.
So, I think it maybe a loss for you.
Then, thank you for your time.
