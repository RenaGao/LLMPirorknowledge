Hello, boss.
Um, uh, I know the restaurant didn't have - did not prohibit smoking.
But my friend didn't eat - didn't eat a lot, so---
Yes.
Just a while - just a while.
Today, yes, today.
I think your restaurant did not prohibit smoking and, uh, when my friends and when me and my friends eat - uh, eat our food, then someone has smoking and it - it makes my friend feel not - not comfortable.  So, we leave.  And now, I am calling you to - to give back my friend's money.
I - I know you opened the restaurant and make - want to make everyone to free in you restaurant.  So, you accept the smoke - smoker or non-smoker in the restaurant.
But - but do you think when the non-smoker in the restaurant, they - they - they - because of the smoking, they feel uncomfortable?  I think they don't - they don't like the - your restaurant and---
Because I, uh - we all - we all want to make your restaurant to be better.
But they have a point.  My friend didn't - didn't eat well.
Do you know the smoke is on the air and it can spread anywhere or it's there? 
Because you - you - you are the boss.  So, I - I must tell you.
That's your case, right?
Although, it is, uh - it - this case concludes our faults, that's your XXX .
Because many people in the restaurant, if I immediately call you and many people also want you to solve their problem and I - before, uh, I - after I left and I call you is I want to talk.
Yes, okay.
Thank you.
