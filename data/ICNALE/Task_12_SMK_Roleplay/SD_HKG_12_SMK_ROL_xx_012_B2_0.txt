Yeah, thank you.  Uh, well, I found your restaurant, um, didn't prohibit your customers from smoking inside and I - uh, my friend can't stand the smoke and I wish to leave now but I do think that I should have the refund on - on my meal because it's not my fault to, um, leave, um, due to the - the smoke in your restaurant.  And I do think that you should, um - you should ban smoking in the restaurant because the government has already, uh, food - um, or the restaurant in, uh, on the banned on smoking.  And that's why I can actually complain - file a complaint on your restaurant to the government on, um, this issue, and that's why - and also I - uh, we actually haven't finished our meal.  You should, um - it's a - it's a - it's a ground for us to ask for the refund.  So, yes, that's it.
Well, a coupon actually would be a good compensation, however, if your company, um, would not, um - so after this, um - after this issue - after this time if you still haven't put on the banned on smoking I - I would - I do - would file a complaint to the government - the department so that, um - and I hope that would not cause you too much trouble by that time.
