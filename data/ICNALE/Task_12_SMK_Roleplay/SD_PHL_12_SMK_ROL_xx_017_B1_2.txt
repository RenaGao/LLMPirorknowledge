Ah, hello, is this the restaurant owner?
Hmm, me and my friend, came back to your restaurant and we observed that there are plenty of smokers in the, in the dining area.  You should ah, you should have a separate, separate ah, smoking area so that the non-smoker customers are not affected.  We would like to request refund, because I believe that our health was compromised.
Well, I really suggest that you place a separate smoking wet-lounge for the smokers and the non-smokers for our cust, customers.
Can you just give us vouchers for, for meals?  
Okay, thank you.
All right.
