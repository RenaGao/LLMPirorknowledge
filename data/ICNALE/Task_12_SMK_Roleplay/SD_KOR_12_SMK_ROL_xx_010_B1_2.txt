So, we went there to happiness and - and we ordered our food, and by that time nobody was smoking, so we didn't know what's going on.  But while XXX  some people started to smoke, so I asked like why - why you're letting people smoking in the place. 
I was then explained that your restaurant is not prohibit smoking.
Uh, yes.
