Uh, hello is this the restaurant manager?
Well for me, it's quite unhealthy, you know because people are trying to enjoy meals and they smoke, the cigarette smoke, it's bad, pretty much disgust with the food right now.
Well you can -- you can make this -- this place is not-smoking place.  So people can enjoy your food.  So people can enjoy your food.
What if I don't want to give you the refund?
Well I would like to complain to the health ministry for that because you should, uh, you should, uh, -- you should take responsibility on your customer because some of your customer have some issues with smoke and cigarette.  So if we have -- we want to enjoy food here since we come here quite often so now there are so many cloud of cigarette smoke, so we cannot enjoy our food that we used to be.  So either you give us our refund or we just don't going to eat here anymore.
Okay.  Sure.
