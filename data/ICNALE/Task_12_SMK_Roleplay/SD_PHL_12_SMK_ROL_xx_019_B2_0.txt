Ah, hello ma'am?
So, I was at your restaurant the other day.
And what happened was ah, there was a lot of smokers.  And actually, I do not like people smoking maybe.
And I do think that's a problem.  You should not be eating while you are smoking.  It's not, it's not a good idea especially in your type restaurant.
I don't really recommend you for, I don't really recommend your restaurant for having that kind of policy to be honest, especially there are lot of, especially that your restaurant is a, a popular restaurant.  What about the kids that are going there?  There are children.  It is a family restaurant.
Is it also possible that ah, my friend was really, really mad about this and, and she got sick about it.  Is it possible that we get our like money back, because it was really the worst thing that happened for us.
No, no, but it was really bad that she kept on coughing.  We really went out and we didn't finish our meal, because it was bad.  It was like smoke everywhere.
Thank you very much.
