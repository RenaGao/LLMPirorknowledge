Hello.
Yeah I would like to request for a refund for me and my friend.
Because many people are smoking here and we - we are not finish - we haven't finished our meal as yet.
Yes.
Well because the - the smoke was too much to endure and we can't really hold it.
Yes.
But I also have the right to come to that restaurant and eat there.
No, but  
But you should differentiate between the room for the people who don't smoke and the room for smokers because not everyone who comes can tolerate smoke - smokers.
Because it is more comfortable than other restaurants and I feel it is more reachable for me and my friend to go here.
Yes.
They also said the same thing because - because it is a - because it was a - a free restaurant so they can't really tell the smokers to go away.
No, just that.
No and you should blame your managers.
Uh, I guess I can describe him.
Okay.
You are welcome.
