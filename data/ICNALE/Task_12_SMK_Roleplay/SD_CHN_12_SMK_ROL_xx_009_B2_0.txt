Uh, hello.  Um, this, uh - this is XXX  and I - my friend and I went to your restaurant last week but we---
Uh, but - but we then - uh, the food in the restaurant is very delicious and I am very thankful for your, uh, service, but there is - uh, there is a little serious problem I think, uh, because there are a lot of people smoking in this restaurant.  So, my friend was very angry and - and we left your restaurant and we didn't finish our food, although they are very delicious.  So, I - I want - I want your apologize and for the repaying for the food.
Yes, we - we understand that this restaurant is - is not, uh, smoking forbidden, but, uh, now in the internet and SMS, uh, very people are talking about this - uh, this circumstance.  And, um - and in public areas, people should not smoke - uh, smoke, and this is - this is not good for other people.  And in the laws and, uh, the government is also talking about this circumstance and planning to - uh, to draft some, um, laws about this.  And I think if, uh, you can pay our money back and you will also have a good reputation on the net.
But - because - uh, because on the restaurant - uh, restaurant's app and restaurant ads, your restaurant - uh, the - the food, uh, in your restaurant is very delicious. 
People love - love this food and I think, um, a restaurant - a restaurant which have, uh, delicious food and a more comfortable atmosphere is more suitable for the - this good restaurant.
Thank you very much.
