I want to complain about the - the other customer that is smoking in the restaurant and I feel very unpleasant with this, uh, the smoke smell, so I am - I really don't finish our meal, and we left because your restaurant allow people to smoke and smoking is a very unconsidering behavior to the others people because some of them don't smoke and some of them are child that can endure the smoke, uh, the smell I think.  So, uh, I now request you to, uh - for refund so, yeah.
I think you operate a - a restaurant, your job is to provide service, not only food, because the service is watch - watch - it's very important to keep your business run, so I think if you satisfy my wants and my requests and I will become a potential and loyal customer to your restaurant, so you may made more profit in the future.
I think if you want to sustain non-smoker, you can set up smoking area and non-smoking area so you can arrange the smoker to those areas, so they will not affect the other people who don't smoke.
  That's good.
