Uh, recently, I - uh, recently I have a dinner at a restaurant with my friends.  Uh, because your restaurant is, uh, allowed to smoke---
---so many people is smoking there.  Uh, my friend - uh, my friends see - uh, my friends find out he can't understand , uh, smoke.  Uh, although our - uh, although I - uh, we can't have a good, uh, meal, uh, I - um, I leave your - I leave your restaurant, uh, half the way with my friends.  Uh, after I got - uh, after I get home, uh, I - I call you to - uh, I call you to ask, uh, your - um, ask you to return my, uh, money.
I think, uh, at first your restaurant should not, uh - should not be allowed to smoke, uh, because the restaurant is a, uh, eating place.  Uh, smoking is - uh, smoking is influencing, uh, uh, the people, uh, eating at there.  And, secondly, uh, I think, uh, the restaurant, uh, should be a clean crowd and a clean, uh, environment.  Uh, it is better for our - uh, for - uh, it is better, uh, for the people who don't, uh, smoke.
That's all.
Um, I think at first, uh, I as a, uh, when I - uh, when I in the restaurant, I have choose - uh, I have power to choose where, uh, I have my meal.
And secondly, um, I don't like eat outside.
