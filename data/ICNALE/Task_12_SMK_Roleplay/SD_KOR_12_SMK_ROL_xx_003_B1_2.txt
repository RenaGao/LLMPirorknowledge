Hello.
Uh, I just visited your restaurant.
And I saw that your restaurant is prohibited the smoking, right, in the restaurant. 
However, many people just were smoking inside the restaurant.
I ordered the food, but I couldn't eat at all because with the smoking---
---I couldn't eat at all and I was - I also if I get the smoking from the cigarette, it made cough a lot.
So, I couldn't eat at all.  So, I am sorry, but I ask for the - to refund the meal I paid in the restaurant. 
Yeah.
Just a few hours ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I ask for refunding the meal I paid because I couldn't eat at all.
No, I didn't finish at all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, but for me, I couldn't stand the smoking at all.
Yeah.
If it is so hard to get refund the full, it's okay to payback the just half of them.
Yes.
Okay.
Um, however, um I - I am looking for some restaurants that which is prohibited the smoking.
So, I don't - will not visit the restaurant again.
Yeah.
There was really strong smoking, so I couldn't even the smell of the food at that time seriously. 
Okay.
Thank you very much.
