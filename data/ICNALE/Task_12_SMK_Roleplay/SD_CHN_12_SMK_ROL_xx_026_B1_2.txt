Hello.  Are you the manager of the restaurant?
I have.  Um, yes, recently, I went to the restaurant with my friend but we don't have the good time.
Your restaurant, it didn't prohibit the smoking.  Many people smoked and my friend feel uncomfortable.
So, I - I'm calling you.  Um, the purpose of me to calling you is I want - I ask - request to you to refund - refund.
Um, no, because I have the bad experience in your restaurant.  Maybe I won't.  I won't choose to go back again.
Go - go to your restaurant again.
Maybe, we don't want to stay outside because the weather is too hot.
And the - the inside is very cool.
Yeah.  And I think it is the - it's I think the restaurant didn't - don't have the - the - I think your - I think your - uh, your - your restaurants don't have the no - no smoking area---
---it's - it's your drawback.
Okay, thank you.
