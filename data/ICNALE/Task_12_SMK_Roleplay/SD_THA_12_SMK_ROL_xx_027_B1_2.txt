Um, are you a restaurant owner?
And I have something to tell you that when we registered why don't you attract the - uh, hibit - prohibit smoking sign at the door?  Because we - some of us is allergic to the smoke - cigarette smoke.
Um, why don't you tell me, uh, attract any sign at the door?
It's not big enough.
I cannot notice that, and we go to - we went to your restaurant and we ordered the food, but there were someone smoking next to my table and that is not acceptable.
What are you going to do for me?  Can you do it?
But we - we don't even finish my - our dinner that day because of the smoking.  Can you at least do something for us?
Okay, um if I get 20 discount, 20% discount, so can you provide us any nonsmoking area?  Do you have any nonsmoking area zone?
Okay - okay, so you want to say that you don't have any nonsmoking area in your restaurant?
That's it.  But I won't go back to your restaurant, okay, all right?
