Hello.  I just want to get my money back for the not - for the recently dinner because your - your din - your restaurant do not - is not a no-smoking area and a lot of people is smoking there so when I walked - when I sit there, there is not man - not that many people are smoking.
But, when I ordered my dinner and yes begin my dinner, people are ... suddenly - suddenly all the people are going on still smoking, that I can barely get to eat and then my friends and I get - get away from this restaurant just because - because the smoke.
But we did not - did not finish our dinner and this makes me very unhappy because I - my friends and I was going there for fun because this is a really very, very really - no really hos - holiday for me and him or because we can - we have been - being a past for about 10 years. This is our - this is our - this is - this our really in a memory but you - your restaurant just ruined it.
But you get - do not - do not satisfy our - us because your - your restaurant do not has - has - is a smoking restaurant, I know, but you do not - I think that you may have a smoking area.  You do not have a smoking area and a no smoking area.  I just did not get it and I ordered - when I ordered my order, you did not remind me of this.
But when I going to this restaurant, I think your fo - your food may be the - may be better than other restaurants.
But - but I did not eat it and even just taste it and hardly tasted and eat them all.
Thank you very much.
