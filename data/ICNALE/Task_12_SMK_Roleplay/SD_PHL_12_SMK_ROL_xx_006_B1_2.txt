Hello.
This is CJ.
Uh, is this the owner of the restaurant?
Yeah, I was just at your restaurant recently.  Me and my friend were there to have a meals, although we had uh - we were very disturbed by the people uh, smoking in the area.  Uh, I know there weren't any prohibited signs of no smoking there.  But although the - it was very, very unsoothing for us to have our meal and have people smoking around us.
Well, um, as a customer, it's very, very hard for us to endure the smoke and to eat at the same time.  So I suggest that you have - you create a smoking area for the people who want to uh, eat and smoke at the same time and a non-smoking area because it really affects your customers.  And also by the way, may I request a refund?
Um, is that so?
Alright.
Okay, I understand.  Okay, just take note uh, of my suggestion here.   
But uh, smoking area next time.
Thank you.
