Beep!  Good morning, sir.
I do want to complain actually, sir.
About your customer, actually there is one of them that smoke on the restaurant.  While on the restaurant actually it's not the smoking area.  There is another smoking area.  So I want you to warn - warn this - this customer.
But I think smoking nearly   the other customers is not a good habit, sir.
If it is still like this, I would like to get out from this restaurant with my friends.  And I do also want you to pay me back the fund I pay to you.
Yeah, I'd want a refund.
But, sir, for the quality of food for example, by having such smokers within the restaurant, it will harm the quality of the food actually.  For example if it's healthy and then gotten or got smoke within the food and then it will be not healthy after that.
Uh, I haven't complained to them.
Oh, I see, sir.  I got it.
Okay, got it.  I will do it for the next time.
Yes, thank you.
