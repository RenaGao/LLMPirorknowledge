Sir.
I would like to make a complaint about the customers that, uh, the customers there.
Because they are smoking and then, um.  
And then my friends can smell the cigarettes, you know?  He, she has an asthma.
So since our meals, since we have not finished our meals, so I would like to, uh, to ask my refund.
Because you didn't guarantee the, the clean air in your restaurant?  And then you know, and then yeah.  Perhaps, we didn't have, we didn't eat?  We didn't finish our meals yet.
I'm going to viral about your, your restaurant.  I'm going to tell everyone about what is happening in your restaurant.
