Hi.  I'm calling about a complaint.
Umm, your restaurant is not prohibiting any smoking - any smoking people.  But when we went there, there were so many people that smoking and I cannot endure the smell.  My friend's - my friend told me so that she could not endure the smell too.  Can you give me a refund?
Why not?  You're   - you're not following your own rules.
But isn't it like a common thing that you respect your customer's request?
Yeah but that - but that's really unhealthy, don't you think so?
Yes it is and it will cause other people - you know, not everyone wants to die early.  And not because you wanted to die early because of smoking doesn't mean we too.
