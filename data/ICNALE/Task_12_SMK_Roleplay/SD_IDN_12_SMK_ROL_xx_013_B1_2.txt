Hello!
Okay.  I am your customer and I want to make a complaint.
I - I was from your restaurant just now  ---
---and it feels so noisy and uncomfortable there because so many people smoking and I could   deal with it so I left before I have my meal.  So, can you please pay back my meal because I haven't even eated   yet.
I have left from the restaurant.
I am sorry.  I - I don't have time for that.
We just wait too long and the situation is very uncomfortable so we left from your restaurant.
Oh!  Yes, I know that but---
As - as the owner you have to make sure about your customer comfortability.
Yes, but maybe you have to make a room that non-smoking area so not only smokers but non-smoker customer can enjoy their meal in your place.
But I haven't even eat your - eat the meal---
---and the meal is - hasn't - hasn't come yet.  Uh, we waited too long.
No.  As I said before, I don't have time for that.
You have to improve your service then.
Hmm, okay.
Then I think this was my complaint.
I hope uh when I come there, your restaurant have a little bit better.
Okay then.
