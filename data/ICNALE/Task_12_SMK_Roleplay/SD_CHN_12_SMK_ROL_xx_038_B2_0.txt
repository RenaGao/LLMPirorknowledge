Uh, hello, uh, uh, my friend and I went to your restaurant a couple of days ago.
And we found that your - uh, your restaurant, uh, did not pro - prohibit smoking, but my friend, uh, couldn't stand the smell of, uh, cigarette.  So, we left without finishing our meal.  So, now I demand, uh, refund, uh, for our meal because we thought that - because we think that, uh, uh - because we think that your restaurant should prohibit, uh, smoking because it is a public area and or at least you should divide the area into the nonsmoking area and smoking area.  So, uh, we need you to refund - uh, refund - refund our money back, yeah.
Mmm, no because the next time - because the next time, uh, there will still, uh, be smokers in your restaurant and we still cannot stand the smell of, uh, the cigarette.  So, a free lunch can't really, uh, fix this situation, yeah.
No.
Because, uh, I think we have the right to choose where we want to eat our lunch or dinner.  So, next time, uh, we will still sit inside, uh, and this is our right to choose where we want to sit and eat our lunch, so you cannot just, uh, use a free lunch to - to - to - to, uh, yeah, a free lunch can't make the situation any better for us, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, thank you.
