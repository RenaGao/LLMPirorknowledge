Um, hello sir.  Ah, last week I ate at your place.  I had steaks for me and my friend and I would like a refund because ah, your restaurant is not um, following the non-smoking area.  Although you have non-smoking signs at your restaurant but your customers did not obey the sign.  So I guess ah, even though you tried to tell them that it is no smoking area, they will try to smoke because you are not being strict enough.  So I want a refund.
