Excuse me madam, I - I think that you should - you should - you should give me money back because I think - I don't think I received the, uh, good service in your restaurant.
Um, uh, in your restaurant is - your - your restaurant doesn't ban the smoker.  So, there are lot of people smoking.  Um, it - it's - it - it makes me really sick and my - my friends even wanted to leave your restaurant.  We didn't finish our meal so I don't think I received the good service.  So I think you should give me back my money.
I don't think that's a good way because I - I stayed there and I have to finish my dinner.  Mmm, I think it's your business to, uh, ensure the environment your - your customers stay.
