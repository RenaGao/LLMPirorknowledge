Um, hello?
Can I ask for the - the - the payment - the payment that we give you?
This is because um, your restaurant is allowing the customers to smoke.
It is not uh, sorry, it is not accepted to let your customer allow your - allow them to smoke inside the restaurant because it's affecting other customers' health.
Right.  Didn't you know that smoking can harm other people?   
But uh, we haven't started eating yet.
And we just ordered the food and we - we realized that - that the - the people there are smoking.
So would - would you allow us to pack - to pack our um, to pack our foods?   
To eat it outside.
Okay, so---
None.
