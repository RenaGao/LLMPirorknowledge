Hello.
I am your customer and I ate at your place yesterday.
And can I   criticize your place.
So, me and my friends at your - ate at your restaurant yesterday and we were not comfortable because of there - there were a lot of people smoking.
And can - because - and also we didn't finish our meals because we are not - we were not comfortable and I just know that your restaurant is - well your restaurant is free restaurant but you are not putted   the sign at the - at your restaurant and I am not happy about that.  Because if you put at - if you put your sign at your - at the front of your restaurant, like me and my friends can go - go to another place and because of that I want to - you, I want to have a refund.
But you didn't put the sign about the smoking restaurant.
But can you like - uh can you do another things besides a refund because I am really uncomfortable and I - I think will not recommend this place to my friends.
Yeah.  No, because I complain to the waitress but the waitress...
She said like okay I will ask the manager but she went back and she said that the manager wasn't here, wasn't there.
Okay.
Okay.  I will consider that.  Thank you so much.
