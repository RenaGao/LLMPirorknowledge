Hello.  So, umm, sorry sir, I - today I have - had my dinner in your - your - your restaurant. 
But unfortunately, when I have my - when I had my dinner your - someone in your di - in your restaurant is smoking.
Yes.  And that makes - makes me very confused and very ang - and even angry because my - uh, my friends have - have a some disease - uh, yes disease so sh - she can't bear the - bear the, and the smoke - bear the smoke and that makes me - uh, and that behavior also made her - made her disease more serious.  And so - so she - mm - so we had - so actually we had a unhappy dinner in your restaurant. 
Yes.  So, I found - I - I - I - I want to, mmm, have the refund from you.
But I think, uh, no smoking in public or especially restaurant is very ethical - ethical - ethical point - point - ethical manner - ethical manner, very strongly.  And I think your - and your restaurant is a very - uh, is a very - yeah - high level restaurants. 
So that I - I think you - you need to make - makes the people - customers no smoke in your restaurant, so I think just - that is your resp - responsibility, so I want to get the refund because you didn't do that.
Yes.  And you said your restaurant is, uh -you didn't say your restaurant is no cigarettes restaurant, and - and but you - you - you didn't say your se - you restaurant can't - can have a smoking and either, so I - so I - when I have my - when I - uh, before have my dinner in your restaurant I thought because you - uh, your restaurant is very high level restaurant so I think it may be - it should be a no cigarettes restaurant, and - and actually my friend because - because of the smell of cigarettes in your restaurant it makes her disease more serious.
Okay.
