Excuse me, but I really didn't like the environment at your restaurant last night.
There was too much smoke and I think you should split the - the nonsmoking customers and the smoking customers more and we didn't actually even get to finish our meals because the smoke was so intruding.  I want my money back please.
I didn't know, I wasn't asked.
I didn't see, no.
I didn't, no.
Okay, well, I think - I think that maybe you cannot assume that people would read the sign.  I think you should be explaining better when they enter the - the store.
Well, I think as a business owner, if you want repeat customers, I think you should  .
Okay, well, I think - I think it would be a nice gesture if you could pay my money back and we can leave good reviews for you.
Okay, well then thank you - thank you and bye.
