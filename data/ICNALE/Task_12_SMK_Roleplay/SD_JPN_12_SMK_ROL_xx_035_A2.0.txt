 Uh. Hello.
 Uh. Thank you for the good uh cooking but uh your restaurant, a lot of people smoking. I feel very good, nervous, so uh and with my friends uh we uh don't stand their smoking and uh we uh we have --- we --- and we --- we sit and we have to --- we have to get out   the restaurant, so I wanted the payback   the --- the cooking --- cooking payment.
 Umm. But uh my friends will get --- get nervous, so uh and can't enjoy the cooking.
 Yeah, you think it exactly but I think uh if you want to --- a good situation to uh to --- to a lunch or dinner and breakfast, uh, you should the separate the smokers and not-smoker.
 Umm. But uh the smoking room can get the non-smoker, so if you wanted to communicate with smoker and the non-smoker, uh, will get the smoking room.
 Yeah.
