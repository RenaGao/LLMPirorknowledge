Hello.
Yeah, I - I just visited the restaurant.  Are you the owner of the restaurant?
I am so sorry to say this, but I want you to refund the - the meal thing to me.
Uh, because the - I'm not sure your - you noticed that there was a guy like smoking, uh, inside of your restaurant.
But so - so the smoking what like smell was trouble.  So, my friend and me wasn't - couldn't, uh, finish our meal.
Partially.
Of course - of course we were now sitting in the like smoking area.  But I am afraid you noticed, uh, in Korea right now every - inside of building people can't smoke, people shouldn't smoke.  So, you should like, you should, uh, move away the partially smoking area.
Uh, maybe I - I guess I didn't see it.  But it's still - still - see, you know, you should - people shouldn't smoke inside of the building.
We - me and my friend, we thought like we paid for the environment we can eat comfortably, but we couldn't even eat and - and the - what you're saying is like against the law I guess.  So, I just want the money back.
Yes.
But you know so what you are saying is, you're not going to like remove that the partially smoking area.
But then - then I'm not going to go there again, so.
Yeah, but we - we felt really uncomfortable, so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
