Okay.  Hello there.
Uh, I went to your restaurant a few days ago.
Yeah, but it was not a good experience.
It's just so many people are smoking there, and we couldn't stand the smoke.
We didn't even finish my - our dinners, okay.
Yeah, that was - I was so angry, and my friends, he just - she just feel so uncomfortable, and, uh, it's really - it was - it sucks.
I - I feel we couldn't - because of that, we couldn't finish our dinner.  Yeah, I think we deserve a fund - refund.
Umm, but we didn't finish meals.
Yeah, but---
Umm, to be frank, I feel if - if the restaurant didn't say that they don't, um, ban smoking.  It's a real - it's a little strange to - to ask for a refund because of some people smoking there.
Okay.
Okay, but - but you know because of so many people smoking there, my friend just - she became ill.
Yeah and that's - that's your responsibility, okay.
Okay.
