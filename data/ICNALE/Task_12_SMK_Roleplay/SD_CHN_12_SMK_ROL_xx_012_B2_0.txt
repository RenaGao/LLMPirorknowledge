Hi, uh, I, uh - I have been to your restaurant with my friend---
---several day - several days ago, um, but unfortunately my friend, uh, we didn't finished our - our dinner but---
---uh, and we leave the restaurant right away because of the - the environment there it's a full of smoke.
Uh, we feel really sorry - uh, we feel really upset about this and my friend had a really bad experience there, because his - actually it is her first time to have a dinner with me.
And, she - but she - she got really upset because the - she thinks she is not only upset about the smoke but also upset about me because I choose this restaurant.
Uh, so, could you refund me back and, uh, uh, may - maybe just refund me is okay.
But, uh, yes, I understand there is no sign over there, but actually I mean in our - uh, in these days, uh, every people knows smoking people and non-smoking people can - should be separated---
So, but in your restaurant, I am - I think there is no sign of course but also the tables are not separated which is the smoking table, which is non-smoking table, there is no sign also.  So, uh, and I - when we taken the dinner, uh, the waitress said this area is non-smoking area but we are covered with that---
---smoking people, so we don't have really good time over there.  So, could you refund me?
Yes.
Yes, but we really likes yours food.
And for me, I am - I - I am not really upset about the smokes, but I like your food over there for several times for myself.  But at this time I have my girlfriend with me.  We are eating the first time and I wanted to show her the - your good food, your good experience, your good---
---waiter - waitressing but it's really upset for me and really - kind of disappointed so because I had supported your restaurant for so many times.
Thank you.
Thanks.
