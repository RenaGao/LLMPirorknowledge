 Okay, umm, uh, hi. Today, I and my friend went   your restaurant.  
 Yeah. And have --- and had dinner in it. But there --- there were so many people smoking. And my friends can't stand the smell and smoke. So, we didn't continue to have dinner. So, I want you to spend money.  
 Umm. Please return the money for the dinner.
 Umm. But you are restaurant boss, so you should be careful with all the visitors, all the customs --- customers. So, I and my friend are customers in the restaurants too. So, you should be good for us too, don't you think?
 Umm.  .
 Um-hmm. Umm. As you say, you will --- you think that non-smokers and smokers can be   same place and have dinner enjoyable?
 Umm. I don't think so, because through our experience, we --- we don't feel happy with smokers so.
 Okay.
