Hello, I want to ask are you the, uh, restaurant owner?
Uh, may I please take a, uh, I want to complain to you that, uh, the smoking in your restaurant are really, really, uh, uh - it's a really, really serious, uh, issue.  And I - me and my friend are - were unable to continue our meal, and I would say that, uh, it's a shame for us unable to finish, um, or even start our meal.  And we actually did pay for - for our food and were unable to even start our meal and I would say that this is not fair to us.  And I will request a refund, uh, for me and my friends and I politely ask if that is fine to you.
Um, if a refund is not possible, is it possible for, uh, a discount or a free meal for next, uh - for next time?
Uh, there are people smoking in your restaurant and it's too much smoke and we're unable to even breathe properly.  And, every time we trying to breathe is just cigarettes, uh, smokes from the cigarettes and it's - I don't think it's possible for a normal human being to breathe and continue their meal at all.
Well, that's probably because they are a smoker as well as and they - and they are already adapt to those smoking, uh, those cigarettes already, but me and my friends are not a smoker and we are unable to be with such intensive smokes in your restaurant.
