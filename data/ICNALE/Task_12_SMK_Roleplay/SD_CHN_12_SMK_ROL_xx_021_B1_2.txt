Hello.
Did you remember me?
I don't know what I'm talking about.  Umm, please return my money because your restaurant is too - the situation of your restaurant is too bad, and we cannot stand it, and - um, uh, just - just return my money.
You know in your restaurant many people smoke, but it's XXX  forbidden.
So, your restaurant is out of control.
Well, if you - if you don't do that, I will post your restaurant on my WeChat, and everyone will see and they will - no one will go to your restaurant anymore.
Yeah because your restaurant - um, uh, um, the smoke in your restaurant is so serious that it's not even a place for eating.
Even though it's - even though your restaurant, you know, for big smoking, but - um, this - um, this kind of smoke, no one can imagine, so---
