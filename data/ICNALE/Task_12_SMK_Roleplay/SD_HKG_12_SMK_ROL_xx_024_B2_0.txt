Um, hi, sir.  Um, I recently dined at your restaurant, um, 2 days ago with my friends.  And for some reason your - your restaurant did not prohibit smoking.  And I am not sure if it's legal in Hong Kong.  And we haven't finished our meal, but then we had to leave because we couldn't stand how bad the air and the smokers, eh, in the restaurant.  And, so I would like a refund to me and my friend and please do make some improvement to your restaurant as to maintain your - your customers and to improve the environment so the other people can go there without being disturbed for the meals.
Well, I mean, for the refund I, uh - it - it - it's not that that meal did not cause me XXX   what, what I am, uh, concerned about is how your restaurant is actually an indoor environment that has no rules about smoking and as I mentioned it's not really legal in Hong Kong.  And I am sure if - if you don't refund it's fine, I'll just report you to the - the government anyway, because if you don't make any improvement then it - it's not safe for your restaurant, it's not safe for your customer and any future customers that's going into your restaurant and have a - and hoping for a dining experience, uh - good dining experience, only turn out that they have to leave because of the unpleasant, um, air and smoking.
Um, sure.  That's fine.  That's no problem.  And, thank you very much.  Uh, I appreciate your willingness in improving your - your restaurant and I hope you have good business, uh, after this.
