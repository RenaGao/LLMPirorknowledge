Hello.
This is Dina, and I am sorry to interrupt you, but I have just finished - uh, actually I didn't finish my lunch.
Umm, just 30 minutes ago, I - I - I left with my friends because there are many people smoking near us.
Yes, it's just too bad and I think we - we should get our money back.
But in Japan, you know, it is very - uh, there are many restaurants that they divided the areas by smoking area and nonsmoking area.  Maybe you - you guys should do that.
But you know what, what I - what I care the most is that you didn't put on the sign on your restaurant.
Well, I think maybe - maybe opening a restaurant is not your good choice.
Maybe 30%?
You prepared everything, but I - I - I paid the fully money and - but I didn't finish it, not because my stomach don't feel well or other things, it's because of the atmosphere here.
So, I think I should get 30%
Okay, thank you very much.
