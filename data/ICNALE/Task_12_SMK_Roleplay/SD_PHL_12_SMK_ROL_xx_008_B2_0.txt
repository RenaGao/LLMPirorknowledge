Hello.
Ma'am, I am the one of the customer who - who dined in your restaurant yesterday.
My friend did not enjoy the smell of the cigarette the people were smoking.
And then, the situation we just - we just leave the restaurant and the food that we ordered is not eaten.
I would like to ask for a refund for our meal?
Okay.  I understand, thank you.
