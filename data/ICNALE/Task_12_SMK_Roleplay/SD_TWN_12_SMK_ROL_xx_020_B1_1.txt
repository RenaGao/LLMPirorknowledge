Um, excuse me.  I am - I'm going   to your restaurant with my friend recently and, um, there are too many people smoking in the restaurant and I and my friend can't - cannot enjoy smoking smell.  So, we left the restaurant without having our meal.  So - um, so I'm request   you to refund our pay for meals.
Uh, um,   we don't   we don't know that, uh, customer can smoke in your restaurant and---
Uh, um,   I don't know.
Uh, yes.
Um, it doesn't have people smoking when I and my friend walk into the restaurant and after we get our meal and start to eating - eat, then someone starts smoking.
