Uh, I think that your restaurant has some problems.  
Because even though you say that you are not prohi - prohibit about the smoking, but I think that due to the government's law, it is not legal to do this, because I think smoking in a public space is not - not legal.  So, due to these problems, I think I am   not noticed that this is a smoking place.  So, I went to there for dinner, but this - there are people smoking and I can't enjoy it and also my friend.  So, I think that you should refund the money back to me because of the smoking problem.
Well, because I think that, uh, the food, we didn't finish it.
So, I didn't get the - I didn't get the - the money I paid for the food.
But I didn't finish that food because of your problem that is smoking which is not legal.
But what I think is that, um, if you don't want to give my money back to me, I think I should go to tell the government that your - your - your place is allowing smoking in a restaurant which is I think it should be a public space.
