 Hello, uh, my name is Mike. Uh. I eat   your restaurant yesterday uh with my friend. Uh, I --- I hear it is no --- uh --- there is no smoking in the restaurant, so uh I really look forward --- look --- looked forward to eating there but in the restaurant there are many uh customers who's --- who is smoking umm, so my friend have uh some bad --- bad condition uh after uh after some minutes, so we --- we exit the restaurant while we are   eating, uh, so we couldn't have a good time in your restaurant, so I want to uh give me the uh price --- price money of the food.
 Hmm. But these days there are many restaurants uh which --- which don't allow uh the customer's smoking, uh, so your shop, uh, your restaurant also have   to do those --- this also then.
 Hmm.
 Umm. So, I um-hmm I ask you uh that uh you set some seats uh, uh divide the smoking area and the non-smoking area.  
 Uh-huh.
 Um-hmm. But we didn't know that, so, uh,   umm after that my friend had really bad uh bad health, so he went to the hospital and he is now in hospital.
 Okay.
 Okay.
