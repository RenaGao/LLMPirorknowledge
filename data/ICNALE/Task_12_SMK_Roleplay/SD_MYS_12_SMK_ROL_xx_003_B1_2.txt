Hello, is this is the owner of restaurant?  My name is and I just ah, eh, had meals in your restaurant.  You see I ordered - I ordered this kind of food and while me and my friend was eating we cannot enjoy the smoke.  We cannot enjoy the smell of the smoke and it made us lose our appetite.  So ah, don't you know that smoking in a public place is banned here.  Ah, so please I want a refund for me and my friend.  If you want - If you don't want to  disturb  smoking maybe you could build a smoker area inside your restaurant.  I'm sorry for disturbing.  Thank you.
