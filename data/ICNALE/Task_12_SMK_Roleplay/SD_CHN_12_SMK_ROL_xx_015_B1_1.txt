Umm, hello.
Umm, actually I - umm, you know, yesterday I went to your restaurant---
Yeah, but there are so many peoples was smoking and my friend can't bear with it, so we left your restaurant.  I think it's very bad experience so I want you to get back my money.
But - but I think there are some people they - they don't smoking and - they don't smoke and you can - you know, you can set a smoking area and no-smoking area.  If - if it's just one - in one room and the people who don't smoke will smoke the smoke, you know.
So I - I think it's very awful.  Umm, in - do you smoke?
But do you think smoking is a - is not healthful.
Yeah.  So, do you care your health?
So, you still smoking?
Yes, so - so do you think smoking is a healthy?
You know, I just want to - I just want eat your - in your restaurant and---
---I think the food is delicious, but - but--- 
---but I just can't bear the smoke - the smoke, you know.  So, actually as a customer I just want to - I - I just want you to share your foods for more people so I think maybe set a non-smoking area is a good choice for you.
Yeah.
Thank you.
