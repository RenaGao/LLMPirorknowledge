Uh, you - your outside poster said people can't - cannot smoke here, but there are still a lot of people smoking in this place.  I want to go.  I want to exit this restaurant.  So, you have to refund me - refund the payment.
Because I think your evaluation is high.  So, I want to get   it a try, but there are too many people smoking here and I can't stand this, because I think the - the smell of cigarette is very smelly.  It's terrible and I have - I - I have to go out.
I don't finish the food.  So - so, I - so, you have to refund me.
Uh, or I can take out this meal or just I think---  
Oh, hmm, okay, no, no.
Because I - my friend and I cannot still stand the cigarette smoke.  I almost get crazy.
Uh.
Uh, I think - I think he is - he would be a hospital if you - if he is still in the restaurant.
Because he is going to die, because he is allergic to smoke.
