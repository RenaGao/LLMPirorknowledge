Hello, sir.
Um, I went to the restaurant recently.
And many people in your restaurant smoking.
I think it's your - it's your responsibility to stop them.
Because secondhand smoke is not good for - it's not good for our health.
But you have to protect the one that - who don't smoke.
But TA  - but in our law I don't think that it's - it's allowed you to tell the smoker entering - uh, to let the smokers smoke in the restaurant.  They have to go outside the door, right?
So, I think it's - I think it's my right to get my money back because I got the bad experience from your restaurant.  And you led me to have more, uh, chances to get a cancer because some researchers said that, uh, have - the one who have secondhand smoke will have more chances to get a cancer.  So, is that good for you?
