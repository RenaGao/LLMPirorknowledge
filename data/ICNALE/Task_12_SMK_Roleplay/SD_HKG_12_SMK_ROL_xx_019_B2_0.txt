Uh, I think actually the problem that, uh, the restaurant basically and essentially cause, uh, phase is not prohibiting smoking because it is very common to pour smoking in - in restaurant typically, uh, especially in every countries and every cities, every region and every, uh, con - continent.  And because of that problem so, uh, as a customer I think it is not acceptable because, uh, this is another very serious health problem, uh, that the smoking if the restaurant does some prohibit smoke - uh, smoking the problem.
Uh, if I were a customers I should - of course, I should claim for compensation for the, uh - for the restaurant owner because this is not healthy and this is, uh, trying to cause harm to the, and to increase the risk of we suffering from illness, diseases, some - maybe some - and even cancers if I some--- 
Yes, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
But I was - but this is not good because I must have to, uh - I just say you must have to respect my right, uh, respect, uh, my health and I should have to make a complaint that to, uh - against you because of that problem with this because you may also be liable to legal, uh, liability to some - because you may violate some laws, uh, if the city, uh, strictly regulates the prohibition of smoking.
Um, firstly, you have to, uh, set the common rules abouse  , uh, on smoking, uh, for example, uh, in your restaurant not - no smoking in non-smoking area because you have to separate the area, the whole one from two different areas, the non-smoking area and the smoking areas.  If someone smoke in the non-smoking areas, you should, uh, announce those, uh - first you should announce your staff to not to XXX   uh, some possibilities that they would do like this.  And, uh, you should also, um, uh, announce to remind customers in your restaurant when they are there, uh, to, uh, as - to avoid smokers, uh, from far away as - as much as possible to avoid some conflicts.  Yeah, this is - I think this is the best way to, um - for your restaurant to have a - set a better examples.
