Because you're letting the smoker to - to smoke on the - on the place that should not be - umm, should - should not have smoke.  I think you have to prohibit - the smoking, you have to ban it.
Because we're not - I think the - this is not only my problem but it can be a problem for others that they will not enjoy the food and I think you have to - to pay back and I have - you have to pay back what we have paid on your restaurant, on the food that we have ordered, we -  
I think you have to because we are - we - we didn't eat at all, we didn't enjoy the food or -  
But I think even though you don't want - even though that you're not going to pay back I think you have to fix that you have to ban the smoking.
