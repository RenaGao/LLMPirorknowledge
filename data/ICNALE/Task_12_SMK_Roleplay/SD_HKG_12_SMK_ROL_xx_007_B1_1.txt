Um  , uh, because the restaurant is - had the smell of the cigarette and my friend and I can't afford the smell, I think the environment is not good and it is not, uh, good place for us to have our dinner.  I think, uh, you need to, uh - you need to provide a more environment for the customer that because the customer - so, the customer can have a better environment to have their dinner.  And this can help your restaurant to have a better reputation.
Uh, so, because we haven't finished our dinner bec - due to the smell of the cigarette, so can you please pay back the - my - uh, pay back the money to us?
Um   but, uh, because this is - the smell is actually we cannot afford, and we need to leave at once, so I think this is not our problem, if you can't manage your restaurant well, so I think you need to refund to us.
  Uh   because the smell is so strong and we didn't feel very well.  And although we ordered our dinner but, uh, hmm   but stro - the smell is so strong, it, uh - it will affect our health.
