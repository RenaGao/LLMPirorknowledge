Okay.  Uh, hello, is it the owner of the restaurant?
Uh, I feel so disappointed, uh, about the meal that I just had because, uh, there is a lot of people smoking in the restaurant while, uh, there is a lot of sign that, uh, prohib - prohibit people to smoke indoor, but still your staff or anyone doesn't - didn't, uh, stop them, and all the mealed and my mood is so, em, affected, and I am strongly, uh, request for the refund of this meal.
Why?
Yeah, but is so bad - it is so unreasonable, uh, to stay in the restaurant full of, uh, cigarette smoke, uh, yeah, full of smoke.  And me and my friend is not a smoker - is do not - uh, didn't take - didn't, uh - uh, didn't smoke and the smell make me feel so annoying and irratic   especially, uh, when my nose is running - uh, I have a runny nose.  So, at that time I really want to contact your staff to have a refund process, but it really unacceptable for us to say in your restaurant again.  So, if you don't refund for me I am sure that I will post it in the social media and ask for the news, uh - ask for the media to, uh, report your restaurant.
Uh, I don't think it will a good option, uh, alternative for us because we really feel disappointed even we have report the situation to you, you don't give us any promises like you will train your staff to, eh - eh, to, uh, not allow people to smoke in your restaurant anymore, but you just give me a discount, which mean that you don't want to have any improvement and you just want to us - us come back in the future, but I am not accepted.  So, I think only refund can be - refund only - refund will be the only one options.
Thank you.
