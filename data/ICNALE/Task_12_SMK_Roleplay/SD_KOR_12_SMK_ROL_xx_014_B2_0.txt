Okay.  Umm, are you - are -are you the restaurant owner?
Uh, I think I want to get a refund of my money.
Because I ate some food at your restaurant but there are so many people smoking at the restaurant, so it's really disgusting and I'm really uncomfortable during eating, so I want to get refund, umm---
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I agree about it but first is there - if there are more people - if there are more people that saying it's really uncomfortable for the smoking people, I think you have to make some, um, make some rules, make some rules. .
Umm, kick them out is you might think it's little - but I think, uh, to kick them out first because---.
Because they are your customer - customers but also like no smoking people are your customers - customers too, so if we don't like it and you said that - you told them to not smoke but they didn't, umm, do it then I think you might say something to them and there have to be some rules for---.
Refund?  Umm, if you are hard to refund the money then how about like - if I come here again, how about some, umm, discount or---
Yes.
That's too bad.
