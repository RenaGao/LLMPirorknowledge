So, I am calling for a refund for, uh, both me and my friend.  Actually we've just left your restaurant because many, uh - many customers smoked inside, and we just can't bear with it - bear with this - like the smell of it.  Uh, I do think that, uh, it is your responsibility to maintain the, uh, like, uh, a good environment for us to dine because, uh, based on the hygienic reason because, uh, we are supposed to have the meal - have the food in a clean condition, however, I do think that the smokes really contaminate the food and affect our appetite.  And also I do think that, uh, smelling - like having dinner with the smoke together is really unbearable and also it is really irresponse - irresponsible for you to do so because I expect at least there is a smoking area and a non-smoking area to like accommodate the customers' needs.  So, in this case, we didn't even finish our dinner because of your irresponsibility, so we really wish for a refund at least for the compensation, yeah.
Okay.  First of all, I am really sorry for the bad experience.  Uh, that is not our intention.  But I am really sorry we cannot do a refund.
Uh, it is fine to not have a refund.  Actually, my concern is to at least to make some improvement for like - or making some, uh - yeah, making some improvement to at least separate those smokers with non-smokers to, uh, let people have more enjoyable dining experience at least.  So, well, actually it's fine, uh, if you don't refund because I don't think I'll go to your restaurant again if you don't make any improvements, yeah.
Um.
We'll see, because again what we can't bear is the smoke, like the smokers smoke freely in that restaurant so if there isn't any solution for that I don't think that me and my friend will come again, even there is discount or even there is a free meal or so, yeah.
