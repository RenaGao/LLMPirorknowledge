Hello.
Uh, I'm the person today, uh, went to your restaurant.
Oh thank you also too, but I have a question to tell you.  Because today, I went with my friend, um, to your restaurant.
But because of your restaurant is no - isn't no smoking, it's smoking place.
---very, uh, around us - the people around us all smoking there and my friend, uh, she is uncomfortable about that, very uncomfortable about that, so we didn't finish our meals and we get out ... just late maybe a little, and it's very, um, unhappy experience.
So may - can you return my and my friend's - me and my friend's cost back to me?
Okay but, uh, I have an idea.  Because you never say it no smoking but you never said it is smoking.  So maybe, can you put a big sign out of your restaurant to show us it is smoking restaurant?  I - me - I and my friends didn't realize you are a smoking restaurant, so we went there.
If we realized, we will never went there and now my friend and - my friend feel so com - uncomfortable maybe for many - a long time
And it's very influenced to his life and work.
