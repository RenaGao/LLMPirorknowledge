Oh, I have a complaint.
Uh, last week we went to your restaurant and we gave our order and when we were waiting, many people around us were smoking and we were very, you can say, disturbed and bothered by the smell and smoke, so we, uh, felt so irritated and disturbed that we had to leave the restaurant and yet - uh, but we had already ordered and paid so I want you to refund our money because we did not eat and we - before our food could, uh, was served, we left the restaurant.
Why sir?
But also for the environment, environment wasn't up to the mark.
That you allow other people to smoke.
And there are many who don't like, so they are bothered. 
I think you should put a notice that smoking is not allowed and those who are very addicted to smoking, they should, uh, go for it later or they should go outside for the smoking. 
But I think beside enjoying, it's not just damages the health of the smoker but the person around as well. 
But I think we should, uh, get back to the business and that is that I need my money back because---
I told you the reason that we did not eat our food.
But---
But we did not eat it.  We did not even touch it.
Uh---
You don't think that you should give me my money back?
And you don't think that your, uh, environment of your restaurant should be changed?
And it does not bother you that many people leave your---
And what about those people who do not smoke.
So, you prefer smoker over non-smoker?
Oh, okay.  Your restaurant was---
Yes.
