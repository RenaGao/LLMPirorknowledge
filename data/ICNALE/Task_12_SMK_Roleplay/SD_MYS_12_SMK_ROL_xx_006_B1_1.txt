Hello sir.  
I am calling you regarding your service at your restaurant.
I am not satisfied with your service as you - you allow - you allow people to smoke in your restaurant.
If possible I want a refund and if possible you should - you should put a sign that prohibit smoking for customers as it is very unhealthy for other customers to eat and for them to enjoy their meal properly.
Yes.
Because your service is not satisfying for us as a customer and it's our - and it is our right.,
Thank you, sir.
