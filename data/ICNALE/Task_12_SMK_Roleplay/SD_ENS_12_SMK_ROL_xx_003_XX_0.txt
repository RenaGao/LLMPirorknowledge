We have a problem here.  As we got in here, we didn't realize that this is a smoking area  .
And all around us, suddenly we see people are smoking from all - and my friend cannot stand it and we already ordered, and halfway through, and we cannot stay any longer  
And it's not - it's unpleasant to eat while have be a secondhand smoker.
I will appreciate if you could understand our situation.
Okay, well, in - is it - as you can see, we can't continue eating here and my friend cannot stand anymore, and we are still hungry, we would like to leave and ask you kindly to refund our money.
I wish I - I knew that or I could see the sign or maybe I didn't see the sign, but this is a little too much.  I mean if this will continue, trust me, the nonsmokers are not going to come here anymore.  So you will lose most of your customers.
Yeah, but sir, can you realize that people who don't smoke, they will be affected by  .
And this is - frankly this is really too much.  I mean they are right next to us, they are puffing, and we can just smell right there and it's unbearable to stay here any longer.
uh, yes.
I don't - I have never smoked.
Thanks for your recommendation, but at the meantime I will really appreciate we can't stay here any longer and I agree with you, I just - we just can't continue eating and we haven't finished it and we would like to have our refund so we can go and continue our  .
Well, the choice was - this is our first time and we haven't got this - in this situation before.  And if - we wish we could finish, we could continue, and this is as a customer service I am asking you for your - to help us out in this situation.  If you want us to just walk out, walk out hungry, then it's your choice as well.
