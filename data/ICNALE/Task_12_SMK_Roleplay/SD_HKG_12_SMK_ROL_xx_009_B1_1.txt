Um, me and my friend was - were eating dinner in your restaurant and your restaurant is not, uh, prohibit smoking, um I think you - maybe it's good for some people but it's really affecting us and my guess has - have no mood to eat anymore and you can have area that, um, not prohibit smoking but please provide us to have area that is prohib   smoking and then we can enjoy our dinner here.  And because of the smell, we couldn't finish our dinner there and we are now asking for the refund and   because we couldn't finish our dinner I think this is your fault.
But we couldn't finish it and we only eats like few bites of it and then almost we didn't eat but because of your restaurant smell and then we couldn't eat there, so I think this is your fault.
Um,   um.
I think you have to set up area that is prohibit smoking and then because when you're eating with the smell, it's feel really bad and   people will not have the mood to eat anymore and it will affect your business and your customer will lose, so I really suggest that you have to have an area that prohibit smoking.
