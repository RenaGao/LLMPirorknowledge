Okay.  Hello?
Okay, so I - I'm one of your customer like yesterday.   
Yeah, I went to your restaurant with my friend.
Like we had lunch there.
But we had a situation there.
Uh, yeah, you know that there are a lot of people smoking in your restaurant.
Like even when we were eating, and I don't really see any like special place that allow to do some smoking.  So, we were bothered yesterday and then we decided to just leave even though we still have our meal on our table, like we haven't finished our meal.
Free from smoking?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know it.
Like, I know that your restaurant is free, like everybody can do anything.  But at least you have to like separate the place from the smoking and the non-smoking place, because it's very, it's - it's - it's really bothering.
Like, can I - can I just - can I just like have my money back?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah - I - I told your - one of your employee.
Like they cannot do anything because there is no some like set rule for not smoking, like yeah, you just can smoke like anywhere in the restaurant.
No, I can't, because it's very, it's - it - it was quite packed.
Yeah.
Okay.  At all?
Yeah, yeah, at least my suggestion as a customer that you can allow people to smoke but you have to separate the place there, because it's very bothering when you are not smoking in a smoking place.
All right.
