Hello, are you the restaurant owner?
I really want to - umm, I'm very displeased at your restaurant because you let smokers, smoke here in your restaurant.  It's really not nice since a restaurant is somewhere you should eat and when you eat you shouldn't really smell smoke because it's really not good.  So I really want you to - umm, at least give a place for it, a smoker's area I guess but not here while someone is eating.
I really - this is not something you should think about because it will lower your income because people - a lot of people displease   smoking - umm, people who are smoking while they're eating.
