Uh, I think like my friend wants his - my friend want his money back.
Uh, it's because of the smoke in the restaurant.
Yes, but my friend wants to enjoy your food.
Without the - without the hassle of breathing smoke from other people.
Um, to be honest, I don't know, it's my friend rather.  But I think - I think he has a point as well.
To be honest, he wants a refund.
