Uh, hello?
Uh, I - I am the one that's go, uh - uh, went to your restaurant and, uh, in the XXX   people that smoking but I can - I, uh - I cannot eat in the middle of the people that smoke, so can I make a money back or just some money?
No.  But, I think - can I make some suggestion for your restaurant?
Uh, maybe you should make some the - some room that for only people that don't like the smoke - don't like smoking, uh, maybe you just make the area for the people that they don't like to get in the some smoke of other people.
Uh, but I - I don't know that - that in the restaurant that's allowed the people smoke - can smoke inside the restaurant.
I know it - it's not my fault but I just want my money back.
