  A few weeks ago, there - in the park there was a mother and her son who were playing in the park.  And here comes - here came uncle John, uncle John was having a bad day and he, uh, went outside of his company and started smoking around - near the - the park.  The mother saw uncle John with his, uh, cigarette on and the - the baby - his - her boy started coughing.  But uncle John didn't realize that there were people in the park.  The mother came to uncle John and told him to, uh, stop smoking because, um, the park can - here in the park he couldn't smoke here as a legal and the smoke came out from his cigarette, um, get - uh, got her son cough and that's why uncle John, um, put off his cigarette immediately and start apologize.
