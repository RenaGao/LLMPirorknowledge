  okay, a few weeks ago a sister, her name is Mary, and her little brother decided to go to the park because her mom was busy and they were playing in the sandbox and the little brother, John again, before he grew up to go to the beach, made a big mound of dirt.  He like yeah, made a mound because they wanted to see how high they can pile it up.  Near them was a person who had - I guess if this is Japan he would have - it's not Japan, the region is up to me, right?
Your - your story.
Yeah, my story.  So he has dyed hair and he has a goatee and to some people that might be more disagreeable I suppose.  And the most disagreeable aspect of him was his smoking.  The little kid started coughing.  John started coughing and his - his sister looked very angry and was concerned.  So she went to the smoker and told him very passionately to stop smoking.  And he seemed very shocked and actually he looks very guilty and he put his cigarette out in a portable ashtray.  That's pretty - it's pretty considerate.  So yeah, he just put it in the ashtray.  He seemed pretty conscientious and then he apologized and Mary looked, you know, a bit self-righteous actually.  Okay.
