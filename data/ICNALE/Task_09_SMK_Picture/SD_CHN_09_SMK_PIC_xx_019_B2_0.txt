And then, while they are playing with the sand, there is a guy, uh, over - there's a guy just, uh, there, uh, smoking and it's really impacted the child and the child is coughing, uh, uh, um, the - the child is coughing while the guy is smoking.  And the mother is so angry that why is someone smoking around kids.  Then, he went to the guy and told him that she - he shouldn't, uh, smoking while kids are around and also he also should quit smoking for long, for well, uh, just from now quitting smoking.  Then, they argue for a while but - but in the end the guy found out - the guy, uh, realized that the woman is right and he is going this for his own good.  So, he quits - he - uh, he put the cigarette in the - uh, the - uh, in the can and apologized to the woman and then he - he told that I will quit smoking from now.
