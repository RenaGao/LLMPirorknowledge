Okay.  So, a few weeks ago, uh, a mother and a son was playing in the playground, but - and then some guys - a guy come into the playground and started smoking near them.  And then since the smoke is low quality and like it make a lot of smoke out of it, so the children smell and don't feel good about it.  So, what happened is the mother started going to talk to the guy with the smoke and told him that smoking is not allowed.  So - and he apologies and stop smoking.  Also apology to the mother and the children about he is - he is smoking in the playground because he feel bad about it.
