Okay.  A few weeks ago, a mother, uh, went to the - the playground?
With her children, and there was a man like smoking in the public and her student - uh, her child, uh, just didn't like it, it smell really bad.  So, the mother told that man to stop smoking.  The man felt bad and then apologized her.
