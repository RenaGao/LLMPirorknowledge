Few - a few weeks ago, a mother and a child was playing at the playground and then there comes - there - there came a man who was smoking.  And the - the - the child was allergic to the smoke, so he coughed.  So, the mother walked to the man who was smoking and told him to quit - I mean to stop smoking.  The - the man just got nervous and apologized her for that and he immediately stopped smoking.  Yes.  That's all.
