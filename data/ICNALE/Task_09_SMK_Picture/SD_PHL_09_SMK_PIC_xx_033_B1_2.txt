A few weeks ago, there was a boy and his mother who was playing in the playground.  But then a guy with a cigarette came around and watched.  So the boy naturally smelled the cigarette that was coming from the man and got irritated.  So the mother asked the man to ad to stop to stop the man from smoking around this child.  So the man quickly put out his cigarette and apologized to the mother.
