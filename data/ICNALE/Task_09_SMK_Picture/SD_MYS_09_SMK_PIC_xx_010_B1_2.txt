So, a few weeks ago a sister bring his younger brother to a playground and when they are at the playground there's a man who smokes nearby.  Upon inhale the smoke - after inhaling the smoke, the little boy get cof-cough, and uh, it is because of the smokes coming from the man.  The sister is not very happy with the situation and he went to the man and asked him not to smoke at the playground.  So, the man realize that he- he has done something that is supposed not to, and he says sorry to the sister, little girl.
