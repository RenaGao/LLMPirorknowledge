So, a few weeks ago a mother and her boy went to a park and play - and played.  And when they were playing, there were - there was a stranger walking nearby smoking a cigarette.  And the mother's boy immediately coughed because of the smoke and he had a history of asthma.  And the mother immediately approached the guy to and say - and said, please do not smoke here because it is a public area and especially I have a kid with asthma.
And the stranger then immediately put out the cigarette and apologized to the mother.
