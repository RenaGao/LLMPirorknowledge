 , okay.  Umm, a few weeks ago, there was a mother and a child in the playground.  They were playing in the sand, in the sandbox.  And then, there was a man who was smoking.  Then, the mother saw the man smoking and realized that her kid was affected, the kid was coughing.  So, the woman approached the man who was smoking and, and she told him that umm, can you please stop smoking, because the child is being affected.  And then, the man realized this so that he said sorry to the, to the woman.
