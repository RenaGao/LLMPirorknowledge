A few weeks ago a woman and a boy - woman and a son were playing in the park.  Uhm, as they were playing, a man walked by and started to smoke a cigarette.  The boy or the son started coughing and the mother went over to the man and said, hey, you shouldn't smoke cigarettes.  My son is over here.  And he felt very bad.  He put out his cigarette and he apologized to the woman.
