Uh, a few weeks ago, a mom and his   son, uh, were playing in the garden - in the park and, uh, and a man walked by.  He is - he was smoking and the kids, um, fell ill after smelling the smoke.  So, his mom talk to the man, tell him to, uh - tell him not to smoke in the playground, because there is - there were many children there and it is not good for them.  So, the man says sorry and, uh, immediately stop smoking.
