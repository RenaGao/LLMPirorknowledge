A few weeks ago, a mother and a child was playing in the park.  Then, a man came with a cigarette.  And then he's smoking so close to the child that makes the child cough.  So the mother was worried.  And then he   approached the man saying, "Just stop smoking, because it's not good to the people in the surrounding." So the man felt sad and then he apologizes to that lady or to the mother.
