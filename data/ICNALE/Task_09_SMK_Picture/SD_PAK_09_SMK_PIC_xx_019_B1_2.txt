A few weeks ago, uh, very young boy was, uh, playing at a beach with her - his mother.  Then, uh, suddenly after some time a smoker passed by.  Then, the mother felt, um, very insecured.  She - she turned her son's fees and said that - and went to that smoker and tried to stop him from smoking as it is not good habit or, uh, she tried to - uh, tried very hard.  And at last he, um, he blow off his cigarette, blow out and then punished and the boy also - the smoker apologized to the lady as well at the end.
