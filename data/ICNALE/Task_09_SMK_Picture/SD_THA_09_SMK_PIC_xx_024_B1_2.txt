Okay, so a few weeks ago, uh, I was - went to the park, and I saw that - uh, I think it's mothers and her sons were - were playing in the ground.  Her son was playing with the sand.  I think it is castle sand, and they are looking - and looks like they have a lot of fun.  And suddenly, there is a man come into the park, and smoking - and smoking too.  And it's like - it seems like the child have an allergies to the smokes.  And her mother kind of worry about that.  So, her mothers go - go to the man, and ask - ask the man, uh, to stop smoking because it's very bother her sons.  And after the man know that, uh, the smoking harm to the childs, he stops smoking and apologize to the mother.
