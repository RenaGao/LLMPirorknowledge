Okay.  A few weeks ago when I was went to the city park, I saw a boy and his - and his mother is playing in sand which is look very happy both of them.  Well suddenly there is a man who passing by.  The man is smoking a cigarette and his smoke is everywhere.  Yeah, and then the mother felt that the smoke is disturbing the kid and the kid also really, really look very poor when he inhaled the smoke.  So, the mother coming to the man and told the man that sorry sir, you have to stop smoking here, there is a children here, yeah.  And then fortunately the man understands the situation and then he - he - he suddenly shut off his smoke and then he also apologize to the mother who is the kid disturbed by his smoke.
