Okay.  Hmm, a few week agos, I - I walked to, uh, garden path, and I walk along and smoke, uh, spread to, and I saw, uh, a woman and a boy came, uh, sand, and I just walk along there.  And then the woman came at me.  Uh, she - she - she saw me and then she walked to me and told to me that the smoke, uh, have a damage to, uh, his little boy and she asked me that can you please stop smoking, because this - it is not, uh, benefit to my boy.  And then, I am feel sorry because I don't think smoke will go far to them and we have damage to them.  I feel really sorry and I apologize them.
