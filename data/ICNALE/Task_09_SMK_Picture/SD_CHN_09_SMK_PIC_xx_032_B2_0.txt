Uh, a few weeks ago, a woman and probably her son was playing in playground and they looks quite happy. They enjoy their harmonious time, but at that time, a man looks really, uh, fashioned, just smoking around them.  And of course, the young child, uh, feels not that comfortable because of the smoke from cigarette, and his mom looks really angry about that fashion guy.  So, she kind of yelled at him and persuade him to - uh, how can I say, uh, to give up his cigarettes.  Uh, after that, uh, that man - that fashion guy, uh, notice this situation and he looks really, uh, you know, feels sorry about that and he, uh, stops smoking right that time and, how can I say, apologize to that young woman sincerely.
