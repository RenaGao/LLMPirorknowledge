---  Okay.  Mm, a few weeks ago, I saw a mother and a kid hanging out on the pl - playground but suddenly, a man came up and he was smoking so the boy was coughing because of the smoke.  He - I think he didn't like it but the mother went to the man and asked to stop smoke because my son is having hard time smelling that smoke, so the man apologizes by like putting the cigarette on the - maybe a cup - in a cup so the mother was still upset but the man apologized a lot.
