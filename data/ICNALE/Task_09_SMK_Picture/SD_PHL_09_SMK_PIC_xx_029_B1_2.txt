A few weeks ago, in one park there was a woman together with her child and they were playing at the sand.  And then, there's one guy at the side of them who was smoking and it's very - umm irri - irritable to the child.  That's why the mother of the child approached that guy to stop the action or the smoking that he is doing.  And then, the guy - umm, instantly subject to the lady or to the woman and he stopped doing that smoking and he apologized to the lady for what happened.
