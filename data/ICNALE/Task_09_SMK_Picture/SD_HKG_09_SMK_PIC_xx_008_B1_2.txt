And in the, eh - in the meanwhile, uh, a stranger, a middle age man is - uh, was, uh, smoking, uh, beside the mother and the child.  And after that, uh, I think the smoke is, uh, spread - spreading, uh, to the side of, uh, the mother and child and, uh, the child is - uh, wa - was keeping - was keeping, uh - coughing, uh, in - in the same - at the same time.  And after that mother, uh, reached the stranger and asked him not to, uh, smoke again, uh, beside the mother and child.  And after that the, uh, stranger found guilty and he was so embarrassing for, uh, doing that action that will affect the mother and also the child.  And after that, uh, the stranger, uh, uh, have - hadn't smokes again and, uh, he also apologized, uh, and seek for, uh - seek for the, uh, forgiveness - forgiveness of - uh, by the mother and he was very guilty and he was embarrassing for, uh, what he had done to that, yes.
