And, uh, a man came across smoking and the mother told her son or daughter that you shouldn't do this that the man, uh, out there is smoking and this is a bad habit, you shouldn't do this.  And something was told, uh, to her - uh, his or her mother that you shouldn't, uh - you shouldn't ask me - ask me about this, you should have ask to him and she went there and ask the man you didn't smoke here that it is prohibited smoking here.
