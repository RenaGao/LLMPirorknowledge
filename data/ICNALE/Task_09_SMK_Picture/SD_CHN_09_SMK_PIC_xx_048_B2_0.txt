But then came a man - came a smoker, uh, smoking in that area.  The - the kid - the kid got cough and feel uncomfortable.  Then, his mother - uh, his mother got angry and just, uh, said to that smoker, you - you shouldn't smoke in - in this area.  Uh, the smoker - smoker - smoker realize that, uh, what - what he did is - what's wrong and then he stopped smoking and he apologized to them.  Okay that's all.
