A few weeks ago, uh, the girl who is wearing a - a pink sweater and the boy, who seems like the younger brother of that girl, were playing together in the playground, uh, and some passengers were, uh, walking by the two - two - how can I say - siblings.
While they were playing but he was smoking.
I guess he - he didn't see the, uh, there - there is a young child playing in the playground. 
And older sister saw him smoking in front of the young - young, uh, her brother.
So, she was quite angry.
And she was expecting him to, uh, stop smoking.
But he didn't.
So, he just going in front of him and saying uh "could you please stop smoke because I have a young - uh, younger brother playing there".
So, he was surprised that, yeah, what he'd done.
And he apologized - he - he just, uh, immediately stopped smoke.
And he apologized to her and her younger brother, yes.
