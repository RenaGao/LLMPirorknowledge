Okay.  I am ready.  A few weeks ago, uh, there was a mother and her child, uh, playing in what seem to be a sand area and the child is making uh, a tower which looks like a tower.  And there is this guy smoking in front of them very close to them.  He is wearing green shirt.  And the mom and the child notices that he is smoking and the smoke goes close to them, which makes the child cough and it - it really disturbs the child and the mother.  So the mother uh, what she did was she confronted the man, told him that smoking is very bad uh, especially second-hand smoking because it can affect people around you.  So the - the man was very embarrassed and he uh - what he did, uh, was he lit the cigarette off and then he apologized to the - the mother and then he bowed.
