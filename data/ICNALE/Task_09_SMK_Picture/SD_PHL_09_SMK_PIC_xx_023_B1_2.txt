So a few weeks ago, there is a mother with his   child playing on a park.  Then, suddenly a man arrives umm smoking around that area.  Then umm, the boy start - umm I think he is suffocated by the smoke that was being blown by the man, by his cigarette.  Then the mother approached the man, not to smoke on that area.  Then the man felt guilty and he apologized to the mother.
