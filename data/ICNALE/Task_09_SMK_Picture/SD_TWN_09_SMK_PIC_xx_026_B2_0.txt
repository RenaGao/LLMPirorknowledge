A few weeks ago, um, a mother took his son to the park in the neighborhood to play some - play the sand.  The sand looks molded in.  Uh, when during their playing, there is a man with white hair, come close - came close.  He was smoking.  And his - his smoke, uh, makes the mother and the son - and the choke - and the child choked.  So, the mother told the man to stop smoking.  And the man felt sorry about that.  So he - he just extinguish his smoke - his tobacco and apologize to the mother.
