Okay.  A few weeks ago there is a woman who play around with his   children in the playground.  They play - they play the sand there, making uh like - what, like a building in the sand.  And when they are in the middle of their playing, there is a man who smoke around them.  And because he smoke, the children of the woman start cough - start coughing.  Then, after she knows that the smoking is really bad for his children, for her children I mean, she gives warn to the man who smokes.  Uh, she tells about uh the impact of the smokes to the health and he said - I mean she said to not smoke around the children again and - and then the man - the man - what
