A few weeks ago, I saw a mother with his - with her children - with her child playing in a playground and then suddenly, umm, a man - a stranger, a man who is - umm, is smoking walk along their place.  And then the mother scolded the man who is smoking because - because of the smoke it is - it releases and the man umm, tries to stop smoking and then - umm, gives sorry to the mother.
