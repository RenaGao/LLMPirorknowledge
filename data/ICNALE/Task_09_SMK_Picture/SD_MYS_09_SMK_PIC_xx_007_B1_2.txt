Uh, and, there's also was a guy near the playground was smoking, and the picture suddenly, her brother start to have bad - coughing badly because of the smoke.  So, Laila go to the guy and, uh, scold him because it is not proper for him to smoke because the playground is prioritized for, uh, children.
