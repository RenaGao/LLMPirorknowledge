  Uh, a few weeks ago, Nanny and her little brother Mike, uh, went to the playground in their neighbor.  They were, uh, building a sand castle, and then there is a man with white hair, he is smoking and it made Mike coughing, feeling uncomfortable because uh, smoke smell is bad.  So, uh, the sister Nanny comes to talk with the smoking man and say that it is not good is - in a public place and also the children are around here.  Uh, the man feels guilty, so he stopped smoking right away and he apologized to Nanny.
