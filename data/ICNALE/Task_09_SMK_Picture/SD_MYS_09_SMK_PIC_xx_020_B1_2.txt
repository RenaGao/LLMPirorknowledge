A few weeks ago, a mom - mother and son, uh, were playing in a park.  Suddenly an irresponsible man came into the area and smoke.  The son was not, um - sorry.  The son was not feeling comfortable by the smokers very, very distracting.  And the mother was feeling bad for his son. So what happen is the mother approached the guy and asked him to stop smoking as it is bad for the children.  The man finally feels sorry and promised to put off the fire and he begged for forgiveness to the mother and promised he won't do it again.
