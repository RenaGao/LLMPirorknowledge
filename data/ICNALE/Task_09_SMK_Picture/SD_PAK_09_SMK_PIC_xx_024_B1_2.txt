A few weeks ago, a kid is making a heap of sand and a girl is sitting beside him.  Uh, this seems little bit worried about some unknown issue.  Next time, a boy seems to be a chain smoker.  His style, his dressing, his hairstyle, his body language shows that he is a rash guy and he is observing those kids who are making a heap of sand.  Next time probably the girl has slapped to little kid and again the boys making - making out all the situation again - again he's smoking like a dandy boy and next time probably that chain smoker is surprised by - uh, by that girl and he's thinking to quit smoking.  Next time, uh, probably, he got that idea of girl and he is rubbing out his cigarette and last, uh, that guy's fed up and he has, as you know, give a damn to smoking, his bad habit and probably he's excusing and he's promising to girl that he wouldn't smoke ever in his life again.
