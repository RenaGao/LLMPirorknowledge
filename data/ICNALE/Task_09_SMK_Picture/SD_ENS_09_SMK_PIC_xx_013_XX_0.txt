All right.  So, a few weeks ago, a mother and her young son were playing in the nearby park.  While they were playing uh, a man in the distance was smoking a cigarette.  The mother saw the cigarette as her young boy was coughing from the smoke.  She approached the young man and explained to him and asked him if he would please put out his cigarette because it was disturbing her young child and it was a public park.  He kind of felt bad about it.  He extinguished his cigarette and he apologized to the mother.
