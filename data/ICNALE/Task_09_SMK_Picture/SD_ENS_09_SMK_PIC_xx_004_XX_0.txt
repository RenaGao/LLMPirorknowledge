A few weeks ago, a woman was playing with a child in the playground.  A man who was smoking decided to walk near them, and the woman and child, they didn't like the smoke coming from the man.  The woman went over to the man and told him to stop smoking, and the man was apologetic and he apologized to the woman and put out his cigarette.
