A few weeks ago, there was a mom and I think he is her kid.  A boy was playing at the playground but there one man was smoking beside them.
Uh, because of the cigarette, a boy like cough and he feels really bad, so his mom told him to not smoke in this playground.  So, he - he, um - so ---  he - he put it into - he put it into - what is this?  He put it into cup and I think he - he put it into cup and he said, sorry for her and I think he is really so - and he was really sorry for that.
