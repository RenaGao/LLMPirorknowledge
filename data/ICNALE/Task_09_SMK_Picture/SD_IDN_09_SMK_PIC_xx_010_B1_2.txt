A few weeks ago a mother and her son were playing at the playground.  From afar there was a man who smoked a cigarette.
It's like 10 meters from them.  The mother realized that the smoke made her children, her son   having difficulties to breathe because he has - he had asthma. 
So the mother went to the man and say that he couldn't smoke here because it's a playground and there were a lot of children and also her - her son has - has asthma.  The man - the man realized that his action is wrong.  So not he turn off - he turn off the - the cigarettes and apologize to the woman.  Yeah.
Yeah.
