A few weeks ago, a - a mother took her son to the park and they were playing in the sandpit when they realized that there was a teenage boy smoking nearby.  The boy started to cough because the smoke was drifting over towards them, so the mother got very angry.  She went over to the - the teenage boy, and in a very angry manner she started to scold him, yell at him, telling him that this in fact was a no-smoking area and that he should stop immediately.  The boy realized that he had done wrong, and he immediately put out his cigarette; however, the mother continued to be quite angry and kept scolding the boy and he sincerely apologized and he in fact then was very upset and he went home and reconsidered if he should ever smoke again.
