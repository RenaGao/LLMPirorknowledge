Okay, a few weeks ago, a boy playing the sand with his mother in the - in the playground, and his father is looking for - uh, looking at his wife and his son, but he didn't join.  Actually, he just smoking.  And then when the smoking is come around the son, uh, they are like - uh, he have allergy to this smoke.  And then, uh, the mo - the mother, uh, noted that his son is allergic, so she, uh, run and told his husband to stop smoking.  And his husband feel guilty that he is the cause to - to make his son's, uh, feel bad.  And then she - he - he stopped smoke and his wife maybe she is, um, feel bad with him, and maybe they have some argument.
So he - uh, so the man stop smoking and say apologize.
