A few weeks ago, a mother took her son to the park and they are playing sand.  And a man was smoking when they are playing.  And, uh - the, uh, son cough when he smell the smoking.  And his mother was angry and talked to them and that.  He can   smoke in the park.  And the man, uh, immediately stopped smoking and apologized to the mom.
