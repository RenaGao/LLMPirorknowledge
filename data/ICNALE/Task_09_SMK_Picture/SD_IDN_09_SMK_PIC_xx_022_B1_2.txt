So, a few weeks ago there was a boy and a woman that looked like his mom.  They were playing in the playground and they were building a sand castle when a grow - a scruffy looking man walked down with a cigarette between his lips.
Yes.  The man - the man start to smoke near the small family and the boy inhaled the smoke and he start coughing pretty loudly.  His mom saw what happened.  He walked around and saw that actually the boy coughed because he caught smokes from the man cigarette.  So, the mother quickly comes to the man and she persuades the man to not smoke in playground because there are - there were - there are more - there are very much children in the playground.  The man realized what he had done and he quickly put out his cigarettes and apologized to the mom.  That's all.
