A few weeks ago, the mom brought his kid to the park.  Uh, while the kid was playing, the man in the park was smoking---
And the kid feels - felt that the smoking - the smell of smoking is bad.
So, the mom told the man not to smoke.
Then the man immediately stopped smoking---
---and apologized to the mom.
