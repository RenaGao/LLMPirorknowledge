A few weeks ago, ah-hmm, a mother and her child are playing in the park.  Suddenly a man walk through them while having a cigarette and then the smoke that comes from the cigarette effect the child causing - causing his - causing him to cough very bad.  And then the mother quickly asked the man, ah-hmm, to put down the smoke and cover him from smoking.  Then the man quickly - quickly, ah-hmm, shut the smoke.
And making - and making an apologize to the mother.
