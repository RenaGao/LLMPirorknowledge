  A few weeks ago, there - there were mother and her son in the park playing sand.  Uh, suddenly, one man walked past through them with a smoke - with smoke in their mouth.  The thing from his side, he didn't know that they were there.  Uh, the children smell smoke so - and start - and started cough - cough - coughing.  The mother seem - the mother, uh, seen the man and just rushed over him to tell him to stop.  The man who noticed finally, uh, stopped smoking immediately and tried to apologize the mother and the child.
