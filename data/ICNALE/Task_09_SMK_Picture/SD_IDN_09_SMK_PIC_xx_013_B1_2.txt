Okay.  So a few weeks ago, there was a young lady with his   children in - in a playground.
They look - they looked so happy uh in playing - and played with - played with sands   and then suddenly there was a man who stand   near with him - near with her - with them and he - he smoke.  The young lady felt uh not comfortable with that---
---and then it - it fell worse because his   children - his   son uh got a cough and then the young lady come after - came after the man and she complained him and told him not to smoke near them.  Uh it - it worked then, the man turn off the cigarette and felt so sorry---
And when he left, the young lady saw the man again and he still smoking.  Uh after that, she come after the man again and persuade him not to smoke because smoking is not good for his health.  He looks - but he looks like unpleasant with what the woman suggested.
Yes.
