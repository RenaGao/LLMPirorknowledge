Oh, thank you.  A few weeks later, a girl, lady and his  son were playing the sand in park nearby their house.
Then a man, uh, held there smoking a cigarette.
Uh, and then the child feel uncomfortable about the smoke.
The mom is very worried - was very worried about him, then she told the man, "Please don't smoking at the public place".
The man realized it's unhealthy for the nearby person.
He felt sorry about that and he stopped smoking.
And then---
---he say sorry seniorly  to the lady.
