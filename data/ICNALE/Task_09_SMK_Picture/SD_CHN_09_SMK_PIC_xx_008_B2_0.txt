A few weeks ago, a child and his mother was playing in a park - near the park and a man was smoking in the same spot and smelly smoke make the kid and the mother feel so uncomfortable.  The mother come - came close to the man and persuade the man to stop smoking and put the cigarette out.  And the man feel sorry for what he did and put the cigarette out and say sorry and bow to the, uh, the mother.  That's it.
