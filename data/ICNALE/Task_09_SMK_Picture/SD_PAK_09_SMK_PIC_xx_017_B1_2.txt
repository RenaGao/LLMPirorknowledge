A few week ago, a boy was sitting in a park with her - with her mother and the - another man came there and he started smoking.  So, the - the smoking, as we know, is harmful for us.  So, her mother went to the man and asked him not - uh, not to smoke in a public places.  So, then after a few time the man who was smoking was, uh - was caused by disease.  Then, the mother went to him and asked him that I told you that don't smoke in the public space but you didn't.  So, it is dangerous for you and your lungs too.
