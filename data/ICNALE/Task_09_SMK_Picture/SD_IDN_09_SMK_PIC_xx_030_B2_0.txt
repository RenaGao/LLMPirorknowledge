Okay, so a few weeks ago uh, there was a mother and a kid in a park.  They were playing cheerfully and then come this man.  Uh, he was smoking in a kids' park.  Like at first, the mother glanced at him, like she doesn't - she didn't really like the idea of smoking in a kids' park.  And then the mother came to the man to ask him to just put off the cigarette like - because it's - it's a kid park, there are a lot of kids like playing in the park.  And then the man like uh, was very nice, like he straightaway put off the cigarette and then he really was sorry, like he apologized to the mother, like because he was smoking in a kids' park, yeah.
