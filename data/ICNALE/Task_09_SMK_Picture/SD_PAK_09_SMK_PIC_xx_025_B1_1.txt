A few weeks ago, uh, uh, there - uh, there were two brothers and a sister, uh, one was the younger brother and the other was the elder brother.  Uh, the younger brother was, uh, was playing with the soil in the ground and he was, uh, very dirty in dirty clothes, uh, then her sister comes.  When she saw that, uh, the - the younger one is doing bad - is adopting bad habits he  just - he  just got him and he , uh, used - he  punished him but when she saw that, uh, her, uh, elder brother was, uh, smoking, so she, uh, she - she came to the - then she moved to the younger brother.  Sorry, then she moved to the elder brother and she just - she just punished him a lot and after that the old - elder brother promised her sister that in the future he is not going to do some bad - some, uh, such kind of habits like smoking, so I think that's the crux of the story.
