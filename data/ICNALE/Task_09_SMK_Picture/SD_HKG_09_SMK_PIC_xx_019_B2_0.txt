Okay.  Okay, I am try my - try my best.  Uh, a few weeks ago, a mother and his - and her boys, uh, is on the playground and where a boy is playing sands and suddenly up - a man is walking and, uh, near them, uh, smoke - smoking his cigarettes and suddenly, uh, the boy feels unwell because, uh, that might be because of the smoking of that man.  And the mother sees that man and then, uh, started discussion with him about smoking.  And the mother thinks that smoking is bad, uh, to persons have especially to children and then that mans was sud - uh, suddenly surprise about what she is saying.  And she, uh, sorry the man also, um, suddenly thinks that is, um, it is the same as what that mother says.  And therefore he, uh, maybe - what's this - he, uh - what I'm going to say - he puts his cigarettes, uh, uh, with the fire and then he's make an - his apology to that mother for, uh, smoking with some poor air towards that the boy.
