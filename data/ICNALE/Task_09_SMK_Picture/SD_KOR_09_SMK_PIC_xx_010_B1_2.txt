Um, a few weeks ago, a mother and a child was playing in a playground in a playground and a man was passing by then and he was smoking so often.  And - and the child wasn't happy and the child started to cough, so mother went to the man and told him to not smoke around the child.  So, the man quitted smoking and he apologized to the mother.
