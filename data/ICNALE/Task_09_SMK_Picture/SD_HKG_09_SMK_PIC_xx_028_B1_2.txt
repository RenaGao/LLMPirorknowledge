Let me see.    Okay.  So, um, a few weeks ago, a - a mother brought her child to the beach and then whilst the, uh, child is building a sand castle, a man passed by with a cigarette in his mouth.  So, um, the mother saw the man smoking and then the smoke made her child feel sick, so the mother asked the man to stop smoking and, uh, the man was really sorry about making her child sick.  So, he dropped light, stopped smoking and then apologized - apologized to the mother.
