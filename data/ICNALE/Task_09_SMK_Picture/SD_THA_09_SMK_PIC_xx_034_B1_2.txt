  Okay, a few weeks ago, mom and her lovely child play in the - in the, uh, garden - of a playground, and the guy with the brown hair is smoking and walking to the playground.  The kid is coughing because of he have a smoking allergy.  So, the mom told to the brown - to the brown hair guy to not smoke in - in this area because it's prohibited.
