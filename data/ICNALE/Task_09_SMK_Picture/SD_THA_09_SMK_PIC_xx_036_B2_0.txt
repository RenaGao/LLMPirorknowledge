A few weeks ago, me and my mom were sitting outside the house and then I could smell some strong - oh, I - I would say, I can strongly smell, uh, the smoke of the cigarette and then I had a cough.  Later, my mom discovered it was my dad who was smoking and then my mom, she, um, make - she wanted my dad to stop smoking, and it was a really hard time for my dad.  But in the end, he could stop smoking.
