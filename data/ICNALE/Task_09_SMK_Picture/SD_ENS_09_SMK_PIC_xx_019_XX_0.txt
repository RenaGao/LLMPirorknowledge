A few weeks ago in Japan, uh, there was a young mother playing in a Japanese park with her young son.  A want-to-be mafia young kid came over who was smoking in front of them.  As that happened, her son started coughing as a symptom of that.  Naturally, the mother wasn't very happy, went over to the young boy and kindly asked him to put out his cigarette and gave him a reason for it.  He did and he bowed down and apologized.  However, we all know that five minutes later, he was doing the same thing somewhere else.
