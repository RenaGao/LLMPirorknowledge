A few weeks ago, the woman and the boy were playing in the park.  At the moment some man was smoking beside them.  Because he smoked the boy had a cough.  So, the woman told man to stop smoking and explained that the park is a place, uh, for smoking free.  So, he turned off the cigarette and said sorry to the woman.
