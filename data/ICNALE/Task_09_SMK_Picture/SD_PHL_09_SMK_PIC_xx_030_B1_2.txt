Umm, okay.  Umm, a few weeks ago, a mother and her child is at the park.  But then, a man passed by and he was smoking and the mother - the child started to cough and the mother was very displeased about it.  So he   tried to - he   approached the man and said that could you stop smoking?  My child is starting to cough and he is having a difficulty breathing because of that.  So the man was very sorry and put - and stopped smoking in the park and tried to apologize to the mother.
