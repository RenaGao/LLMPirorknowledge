A few weeks ago, there is a child and his mother playing at the playground.  Unfortunately, there is a man smoking nearby.  The mother noticed that the smoke coming from the cigarette is inhaled by his - her son, sorry, inhaled by her son and her son is coughing.  She told the guy with the cigarette to stop smoking within the vicinity and the guy with the cigarette immediately turned down his cigarette and immediately apologized to the mother of the child.
