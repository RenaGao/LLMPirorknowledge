Uh, so - uh, so the child coughed and, uh, felt very bad, and the mother was very exhausted.  And then the mother talked to the man that he shouldn't - uh, he shouldn't smoke in this public area and this is bad for - for the children and other people.  And then the man found that he was - uh, he - he - he, um, uh, he felt very sorry about this and he apologized to his behaviors, and the mother, uh, said that - then that is okay and, uh, uh, maybe next time, please don't smoke in this public area.
