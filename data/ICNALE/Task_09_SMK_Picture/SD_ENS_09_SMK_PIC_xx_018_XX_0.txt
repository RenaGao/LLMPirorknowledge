So, a few weeks ago, this man went to the park to smoke.  So, he was smoking, not really paying attention to people around him, and then there was a mom and - and her kid, looks like having a nice day at the park, spending time together, and then the kid, I think he's got asthma or something because he started - started coughing, and the mother's like what induced this coughing.  She looks around and there is a man smoking in the park, and then the man - the mother confronted the man quite angrily.  Yeah.  You're at the park.  You're not supposed to smoke here.  There are children around.  You know, it's illegal to smoke in public places.  So, the - the man felt bad, he put out his cigarette and then he apologized to the mother.  The mother still looks quite angry.
