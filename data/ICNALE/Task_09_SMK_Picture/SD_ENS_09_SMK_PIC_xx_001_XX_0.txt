A few weeks ago, he was a little boy.  Later, he grew up and he became a smoker.  Later, in the future, his mom was very unhappy and trying to advise him that do not even be a smoker or do not even copy people who smokes.  And number four, he was trying to give up his smoking habits.  Then number five, he decided that he is going to give up his habit - his smoking habit.  Then number six, he went back home like a prodigal son and - and told his mom, I am sorry I made you feel so bad in the past but right now I am ready to be a changed boy and I am ready to be a good guy to face a better future, and I will always make you happy.  So please forgive me.
