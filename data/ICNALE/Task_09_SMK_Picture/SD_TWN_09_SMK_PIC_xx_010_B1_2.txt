A few weeks ago, a child and a mother playing in park.
And then a man walks through their side.
And he is smoking.
There and then like he didn't - didn't   like that.
And he is - he is cough - coughing.
Yes and then the mother tell the men, you can't smoking here.
And a man - the man   stop smoke - the smoke.
And say sorry to mother.
