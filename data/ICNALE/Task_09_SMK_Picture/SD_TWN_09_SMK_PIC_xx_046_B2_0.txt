A few weeks ago, a mother took her child to park to play and at the same time, there was a man smoking next, just next to the, uh, mother and child.  And the child coughed, uh, because he smelled the smoking and the mother felt this is not right and - and the man influenced the child - the child's health.  So, she, uh, went to the man and talked to him that, hey, uh you cannot smoke in the park, because if you smoke, my child or other people will, uh, breathe in your second smoke.  And the man, well, he - he looks like very - he felt very sorry and he apologized - apologized to the woman - to the mother.
