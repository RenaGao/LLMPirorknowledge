A few weeks ago, there is this uh, little boy that - that was playing in the - uh, in the park.  And then a guy came which - which this guy is a smoker.  And then the mother saw the guy which is smoking and uh, she interrupted what the guy is doing and said that it is a bad thing that to smoke in public most especially when there is kids around that may affect their health.  So the guy immediately stopped what he is doing and apologized for what he has done.
