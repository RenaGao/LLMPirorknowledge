All right.  A few weeks ago Sarah and her brother were playing at the playground near their house.  So - and then when they were playing hmm there was man, ah, besides them who is smoking a cigarette and then Sarah's brother, ah, coughed and then, ah, Sarah immediately approached the man smoking and telling him that to not smoke as his brother probably had asthma.  So, the man listen to what Sarah was saying and then he apologized and even stop smoking I mean not stop smoking like he light out the cigarettes.
