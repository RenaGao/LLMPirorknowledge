Okay.  Uh, a few weeks ago, my cousin and - uh, again.  A few weeks ago a kids and his mom went to the playground and they are enjoying to play the sand on the ground.  And, suddenly a guy pass - passed away - passing through and he is smoking the cigarettes.  And he doesn't seem that, um, a kids were there and when the smoke, um, diffused away and the kids feel irrated   and he keep - he kept couching  .  And his mom went to the guys and asked him to stop smoking because, uh, that place is for kids and the, uh, smoke is unhealthy, uh, to kid.  So - and when the kid realized that, uh, he is affecting people then he stopped to smoke and he apologized to her - to the mom.  Uh, still the mom feel unhappy and still feel annoying because he - she believe that, uh, in Hong Kong those place are, uh, strictly banneded   for smoking and he still, uh, break the laws and that's all.
