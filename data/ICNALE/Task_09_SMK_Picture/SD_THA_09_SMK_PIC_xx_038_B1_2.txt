A few weeks ago, my mum took me to the playground, and when I play in the sand, when I - when I was playing in sand, someone - a man, uh, was staying next to me and he - he smoke - he smoke, but the smell is very bad, and is - it can cause lung cancer.  So, my mum - I - I told my mum, and my mum - and my mum direct to - directed to him and told him that you shouldn't do like this because it's - it affect to other - other people's health.  So, he - he - he was sad and he was guilty.  So, he say - he said sorry and - and put it down, or stop smoke at that time.
