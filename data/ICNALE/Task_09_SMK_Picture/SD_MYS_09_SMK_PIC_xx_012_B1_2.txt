A few weeks ago, Mia brought her son to your nearby playground.
Uh, to spend time with him.  Uh, suddenly a guy with a white hair walks nearby with a cigarette in his mouth.  Uh, and then Mia realized that her child are coughing barely because he have problems with smoke. Mia urgently talked to that guy to put out his cigarette and then the guy put out his cigarette, uh, -- put out his cigarette and then the guy with the white hair apologized to Mia for his unappropriate behavior.
