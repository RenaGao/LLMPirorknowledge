Okay.  Uh, a few weeks ago there was a woman and her child at the playground near their house, uh, the child is building a sand castle while her mom watching him, and then there was a man who smoking near the - near where the--the children and her mom was building a castle-sand castle, and then the mom saw the man and her child started to cough badly and the mom goes to the man and say that he should not smoke here. He should not smoking here because this is a public - a public - a public place.  Okay - and the man started to dim off the cigarette immediately and he immediately apologize to the mom and he really, uh, I can see that he really regrets this, what he does.
