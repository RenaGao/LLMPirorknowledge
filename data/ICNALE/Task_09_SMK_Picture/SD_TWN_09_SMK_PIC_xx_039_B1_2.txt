Okay.  Uh, a few weeks ago, a mother and a child went to the park and when they are playing - when they were playing there a man smoking.  And the child, ooh, ooh, and the mother angry and stared at the man and talked to the man that no, no smoking my child is here.
And then they say oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.  And yeah.
