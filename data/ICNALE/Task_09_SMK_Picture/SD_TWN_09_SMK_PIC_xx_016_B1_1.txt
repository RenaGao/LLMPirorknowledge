A few weeks ago, Tommy and his mother are playing in the park.  And there - there was a man, who was smoking---
---walk - walk towards them.
And Tommy started to,   uh, cough.  So - uh, so his mom tried to - tried to persuade the man stop - stop smoking.
And the man - and in the end, the man apologized to them---
---and also take Tommy's mom's advice.
