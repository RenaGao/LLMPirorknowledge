Okay.  A few weeks ago, the little boy was playing sand with - with his mom at a park and a man walked by.  He was smoking and as you know smoking is not good for people's health especially for children.  So, the boy coughed and his mom thinks she had to do something and then she told the man it is not good to smoke at the park and the man realized there is - there is a boy near him.  So, he - uh, uh, so he put his smoke off and then, uh, uh, say sorry to her - to his mom.
