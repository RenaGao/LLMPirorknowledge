So a few weeks ago, uh, there were a mother and a child play in a - in a playground.  So, the child was building a sand castle and his mum was looking at him and both of them are very happy.  And then at the moment there is a - there was a guy with, uh, bold hair smoking and walk by, walk past them, and then the child smell smoke and he felt very uncomfortable and cover his mouth, so his mum stared at the smoking guy and she talked to him and ask him stop smoking because this behavior badly affected the others, especially in a playground where child plays, so the guy, hmm, talk   - so the guy apologize and yeah - yes.
