... A few weeks ago, a mother and her child was in a park playing with sand.  Then, there came a man smoking, and - and the child choked, and her mother was - was a little bit mad about the man, and - and then he - she walked to the man and told him, please not - please do not smoke here because I have a child here, and the man, uh, felt sorry and stopped smoking.
