  So, a few weeks ago, uh, Matthew played in a playground with her - with his mother, Rose, and then they played very happy.  And then, there was a man who called Jack, and he was smoking in the playground.  And then when he smoked, uh, Matthew smell of this cigarette something and he felt sick and his mother, Rose, XXX   and then she talk to Jack that he should not smoke in playground.  And maybe she said something like, what's the ramification smoking and then Jack stopped smoking immediately and then he apologized.
