Um, so a few weeks Sally, um, bought   her little brother to the park and then they build the sand castle and one man was smoking and then, um, Sally little brother felt bad because of the smell.  And he started coughing and - so Sally talked to the man and asked him not to smoke in the park because there are so many, um, children and then it's not good for them.  Um, the man didn't know he was, um, expecting others, so he felt guilty and he stopped smoking and then he apologized to Sally.
