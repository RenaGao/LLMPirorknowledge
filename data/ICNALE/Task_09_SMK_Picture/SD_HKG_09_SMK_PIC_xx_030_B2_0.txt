Okay.  A few weeks ago, um, Amy brang - brought her kid to the park for playing and spending his time.  And, suddenly a man with golden hair walk past, uh, the park.  He was smoking.  Uh, the smoke makes Amy's son feeling sick and he started coughing.  But then, um, the gold-hair man looked at him and wanted to walked away.  And, Amy walked to him and say please don't smoke because it is a park for children, you may affect the children's health and also your health.  And, so after the, um, discussion, um, the gold-hair man trieded   to stop smoking and apologized to Amy.
