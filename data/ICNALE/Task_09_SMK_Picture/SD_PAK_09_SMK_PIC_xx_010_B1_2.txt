A few weeks ago, uh, in a street there was this kid and his mother is playing and a kid saw a man smoking and when the mother, uh, realized that his kid was more paying attention to the man who was smoking, she thought she should go to that man who was smoking and talk to him about quitting it and - but he does not - he did not, uh, go for it and he continued smoking but I think a few more weeks later he realized that his health was - the man who was smoking, his health was damaging so - and he perhaps went back to the same woman who made him realize that he should quit smoking and ask him - and ask her to show her way so that he could get rid of the smoking.
