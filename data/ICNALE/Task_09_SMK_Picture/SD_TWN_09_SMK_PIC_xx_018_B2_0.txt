Um, yes.  I like to go to a park.
Uh, I like to go there with my mother and sister.  And we would play the seesaw.
In one month?  Last month, I didn't go to park.
Because I was busy with my school test.
My favorite park is near my house.  And when I was little, my mom usually took me there.  And on weekend, they will have many children and parents and some XXX  .  And I like there very much because it is really near my house and, uh, I can play with other childrens there.
Um, yes.  I think she is - she really cares about her son and - and her reaction about the smoker is really good because smoking is really bad for children.
Yeah.  I think my mother is this kind strong lady.  When - when I was little and if someone tried to hit me or say something bad to me and she will be angry and try to protect me.
Um, I think I'm not this kind of lady right now, but I think I could be this kind of lady in the future.
I think some sandbox maybe are really dirty because we don't know what kind of trash is in there.  So, I think if a child like to play with the sand, maybe we can let - let him or her play and - but we still need to be careful about whether he ate - he eats the sand or not.
