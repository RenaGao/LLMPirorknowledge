A - a few weeks ago, a woman and a boy was playing on the playground.  I think she is the mother.  And a man walking by the playground was smoking cigarettes.  So, the boy was coughing too hard.
The mom was looking at the boy and maybe she meant - she talks to the man that smoking is not allowed in this place.
I think the man who was smoking came to sides.  So he - he - he stops smoking.  And he apologized to the mother.
Mm-hmm?
