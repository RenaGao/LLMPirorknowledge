Okay.  A few weeks ago there are mom and a boy in a playground park.  And suddenly, a man standing - a man stand far away, a little bit far away from them  
And he smoked there  
And then, the boy, a little boy is coughed, a little boy coughed and the mother is, the mother anger, had anger with the man who smoked there.  Then the mother told the man to stop smoking because it's dangerous for other people, especially for kids.  And then the man felt guilty and he didn't - he stopped smoked   and he apologized to his mother and the boy.
Yes, that's all.
