A few weeks ago, uh, a boy was playing with her mother - uh, with his mother, sorry, and his father was smoking and the boy was coughing and didn't like the smell, so the mother went to his father and say that if - and say if he - if he could quit smoking and his father - his father stopped smoking and say sorry to his mother.
