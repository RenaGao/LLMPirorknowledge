Okay.  A few weeks ago a mother and her child was playing in the park and suddenly um, a - a young guy was smoking and was passing by the mother and child.  The child had asthma so she was very concerned when her child began coughing because of the smoke um, from the man who is smoking near them.  So he told him to - he explained to the man that the difficulties and what the child is experiencing so and told him could you please possibly stop smoking or go somewhere else.  So the man understood and stopped smoking and apologized to the woman.
