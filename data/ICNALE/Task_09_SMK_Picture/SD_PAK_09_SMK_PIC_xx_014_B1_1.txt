A few weeks ago, a boy was sitting in a park, so there was some sort of sand or soil you can say, so he was, uh, making something, uh, uh, with that soil and there was a boy who was elder than him and he was standing there.  He, uh, smoking, uh, some cigarettes there and the little boy who did not feel, uh, good and the smoke, uh - uh, he feel bad in that atmosphere when that boy smokes there, so the sister of that little boy who came to the, uh, uh, uh, smoking person and saying him that you quit smoking right there because this is a public place and - in - and smoking is not allowed in public places.  So, um, he - sorry, she give some arguments about that smoking like how it destroy your health, so that boy, um, uh, uh, some tears in his eyes and he, uh, quit smoking right there and he bend down and asking for forgiveness, uh, to that.
