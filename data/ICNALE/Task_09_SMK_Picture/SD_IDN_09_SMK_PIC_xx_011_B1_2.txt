Sorry.  A few weeks ago, there was a boy with her mother and they played on the kindergarten and unfortunately a man came across the kindergarten by smoking.  And as you already know that smoking is not good for anybody health, mostly for children, so the woman really, really feel bad about that guy and tried to arguing with him to stop his smoke.  I mean like, could you please smoke but not here, at least not in the kindergarten.  And the guy feel very, very sorry and he tried to get off the smoke and the cigarette and then he - he apologized to the woman.  So, the woman continued to play again with the boy.
