A few we - weeks ago, a mother along with her little child were playing in the playground, and a man happened to pass by them and that man was smoking.  Uh, when the mother saw that man, she was, you know, disgusted by that habit of that man that he was smoking in public and her child was also, uh, you know disturbed by the smell of, uh, the cigarette.  So, she goes over to the man and she reproaches him, uh, that you should not, uh, smoke in public, uh, and maybe the words of the lady were so harsh that that man repented immediately and he put out his cigarette and, you know, asked that woman to forgive him for doing this in public in front of her child.
