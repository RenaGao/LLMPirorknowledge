Hello teacher.  I really want to continue this part-time job.
Because, um, firstly you know that I'm a foreign student.  I don't really have many chances to talk to Japanese in daily life.
Yeah, yeah, but basically all the people I, um, communicate students.  I want to see some more - I want to see more people who work.  They - I feel they can teach me more things about working.
And I have to find a job in Japan in - in a year, so it's really a good chance, I feel.
I see but I feel I can balance the study and part-time job.
Yeah, but I feel - firstly I cannot - um, I cannot do my study 24 hours, and I need some time to relax.  Um, instead of doing other things, I - I feel like maybe I can do part-time job.
Yeah.  And, you know, with - if I - I - if I can have some things to relax, it will help me to improve the - uh, uh, my stud - I can - I can do my study more efficiently.
Yeah, yeah, but I - also I need money.  Yeah.  My parents are working hard, and I want to do things that I can do to lessen their burden.
Mm-hmm.  Yeah, but you know I'm already a grownup.  I can - I want to do the things I can do, yeah, to help to lessen the burden---.
Thank you.
