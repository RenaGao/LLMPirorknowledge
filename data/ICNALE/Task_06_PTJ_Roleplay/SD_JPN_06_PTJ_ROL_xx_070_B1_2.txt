 Hello, uh, I want to --- I want to work as a part-time job.
 Yeah, because --- uh --- because I want to be a teacher, and uh, uh to --- to experience the teacher skills, I want to --- I want to work as a tutor of a uh the cram school.
 And I want to teach the --- the students more to experience uh my uh teacher's skill --- teaching skill.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I think uh studying --- studying uh about education --- education knowledge or some kinds of studying is --- I think it's also important, but uh I think the practice --- practiced actually --- actually practice is, I think, also important.
 And comparing the --- this practice and studying, if uh practice is if uh we become the teacher and uh, uh, uh, teach to stand --- to standards --- the stage of uh teaching uh in front of the students, uh, practice is --- uh, uh, studying is uh we can also uh do that in --- uh --- if we become a teacher --- teacher, uh, we can also study --- uh --- study the in education knowledge.
 However, uh, in practice --- uh --- concerning practice, I think uh, uh, that maybe uh we can't --- uh --- we can't do the --- we can't teach the --- uh --- the practice to teach instead uh in your uh --- uh --- we can't uh teach uh, uh, to practice --- and uh practice to teach and uh, uh we uh do --- uh --- we and uh --- so what I want to say is that if we become --- uh --- we graduate uh university and we become --- uh --- I become a --- the teacher, uh, study is we can do.
 Uh, teaching --- teaching students and the studying --- the --- the education knowledge is --- uh --- both of this task we can do.  
 However, uh, if we become --- I become a teacher and practice more and more to teach it is I think it's difficult because uh if I become teacher, this is a --- uh --- this is the --- uh --- teacher is done --- teacher is worried to do other --- other work.
 So we can --- I can --- I can't do any part-time job.
 Yeah.
