Yes.
But, uh, can you give me a chance, but I think I can manage my time.  I will manage them, the - between the part time job and my study.  I will focus on my - on my study more, but I want to continue my part time job because I need a money - money for my daily life use, because my family did not have enough money for me.
Uh, I didn't ask yes, but I think my grade now is not support for the scholarship too.
Yes, but - but I don't have any money for buying lunch or my food now.
Yes.
I think I - I need to continue my, uh, part time job, but I will say to my manager that can I have, uh, a - a fewer days than now, just 5, and then I will ask them for just 2 or something like that and then I will have more time for my study.
Yes.
Okay.  Thank you teacher.
