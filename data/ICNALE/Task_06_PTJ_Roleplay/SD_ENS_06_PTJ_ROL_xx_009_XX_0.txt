I - I realize you are anti-me me having this job, but it's very important for me to have the income coming in so that I can keep on being a student.
I've looked at them, but unfortunately they are not as easy or immediate as - as simply going to in my case the shop I work at and---
Uh-huh.  Studying is my priority but in this case I - I need to have that part-time job to have the funds to enable me to continue to be a student.  So, it's a kind of a catch-22.  Obviously, the more I am working the less I am studying, yes, but without the job to - without the job to provide the income I - I can no longer be a student.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
In an ideal world I would totally agree with you, but unfortunately the reality dictates that I - I do in fact need to work to continue as - as a student and I'll do my best to make up my grades.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.  Well, what I can try and do is cut down some of my other extracurricular activities and - and find more time to - to study or the other items you refer to beyond studying to improve - improve my grades.  I take onboard what you say, but the - the part-time job unfortunately is a - an evil necessity.
