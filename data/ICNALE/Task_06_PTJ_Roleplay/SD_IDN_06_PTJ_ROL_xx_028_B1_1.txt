Hello Mr. Lecturer. 
I am sorry, but I receive - receive your email. 
You said I should stop working part time. 
Actually, I am not quite happy about that  . 
Because the part time job is for me supporting myself and my brother.  My brother now is first - first year student and he - he - he study in a technical, in technical major.
Yes, the engineering major.  And the engineering major is unfortunately have   so many - so many fund to paid  .  So I have to work hard because my father now is quite crippled.  He cannot work and my mother is only something to earn - to earn his, to earn her household fund.  And yeah and now I have to support me and my brother at least as a friend.  But I promise, I promise I will be study hard.   And maybe - maybe I would - maybe I would cutting some work - work hours and moving it to the weekend.  Because I have a part time.  This - this work is mainly - mainly - mainly use the weekdays - weekdays time.  But there's - there's just a moment ago I - I found another - another place with work - work - work part time, but it's on weekend.  And that is good maybe.  Maybe - maybe - maybe I can apply there and maybe you can stop me from doing my - my responsibility as a child. 
Actually I am truly sorry for when - for the past - for the past weeks because it is really exhausting between working part time and doing class and lab - lab work.  It is really a tight schedule because after lab work I have to attend my - attend my working - attend my work, which from 4:00 p.m. to midnight at 1:00 and 2:00 p.m.  Then I have to work on my - work on my report and work on my assignment.  So I have to - I can only sleep for 2 to 4 hours a day.  It is including and a - a nap time.  So I think the - I am moving the work time to from weekdays to weekend.  Maybe it will solve the problem.  I can - I can sleep, I can sleep - I can sleep maybe 6 hours a day, which I can - which could provide me with more energy to attend class and lab work.
Okay.
