Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I agree with your opinion.
Yeah, it disturbs my study in college.
Immediate - immediately.
Um, I agree with you that it disturbs my study.
Uh, however, I have a big problem.
First of all, my parents don't support me in studying in college like tuition fee or dormitory fee---
---or, uh, the money I needed at least per month.
So, I have to get money.
And also after graduation college, I want to get job in teaching field.
So, it really like related with the job I wanted - I want to in the future.
So, um, instead of keeping working in the part-time job, I want to keep this job at least all semester.
