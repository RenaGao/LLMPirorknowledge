  Um, sorry sir but although it might make some effects on my learning but I think I would like to continue my part-time job because in that case I - it could - it can train my multi-task - multi-task learning and I could also learn lots of different experience from the part-time job also, which is I could not learn if in school.  So, I think I - I would like to continue to do my part-time job but if you may think that it will affect my studies, I am - maybe we can adjust the time of working like reducing the time of my - my job and I could have much more time to focus on my studies also.
Hmm, because although for this few weeks I have - I will have - I will have my exam but I think it - although rather than focusing the whole - putting all my time on studying for my exam, I think sometimes I will have to change my environment and to make myself have some like relaxation or thinking of other points to improve my brain working.  So I think I would still cont - I would like to still continue my job, but in - in that case I would also like study hard and it might can make me - make my brain to think much more clear.  And I will be - it will be - it will enhance my efficiency on studying.
