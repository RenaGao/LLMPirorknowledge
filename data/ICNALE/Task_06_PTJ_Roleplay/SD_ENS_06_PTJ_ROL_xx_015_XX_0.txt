Yes, I am - I am going to apply for a part-time job.
Because my major is business and I think I need more experience in retail environment.
But I won't know how to apply my studies if I don't have a part time - if I don't have part time experience now.
Um, for example, how? 
Yes, but I want to get experience because you are teaching many theories about business such as I don't know organizational management. 
Right, and so the part-time job would bring - help me to bring more practical experience so I can see the theories that you are teaching me and I am more - in a more - in a real authentic manner.
Right, um, but when I graduate um, the companies who are hiring really look - look more - look for more than just educational experience.
Um, how do you know they look for academic achievement only? Well, they - when you apply for a job they want to know what school you went to and what kind of grades you had. Um, that depends on the company.
Ah, I think the part-time job that I am choosing would be helpful for my grades because I get to see how - the XXX   will become more relevant to me because it pays into my - I mean it feeds into my pay actually.  So that would help me both improve my grades and get practical experience and I think that overall it will be more of a virtuous cycle than just having something that's not so interesting to me right now.
