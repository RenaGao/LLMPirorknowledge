No, sir, I cannot give it up because some - uh, our financial issues, I cannot continue study without continue this job.  This is just very mandatory and compulsory for me to continue the job.
No, I have no option without this job.
As a way I have loan, we have to pay interests, TOH , I have not enough money when we take loan and return them easily in the near money, in the near future.  And our parents also is in the critical situation, hand-to-mouth.  Uh, our - my father left the job recently---
---so it is very tough to continue the study.
When I will not submit the thesis, but I cannot continue the study because I cannot pay the fee and also we cannot get the, uh, uh, food for our parents because they are very in critical situation.  They have no money, TOH , it is very important for me to continue this job.
So, I cannot do that because I already told you, KI , told you that there is financial issue major.
This degree - it's a chance that I get degree, but maybe get the late, but INSHALLAH , we will get.
No sir, it is very tough time.
I would prefer to job.
I have this reason because I have financial issues and again I XXX  the finance from my - from parent resources.  Parents as I told, that my father left the job as he is in a medical situation.  We have to pay for medicines XXX .  They are sick for last 2 weeks.  We have to also pay for their medicine.
