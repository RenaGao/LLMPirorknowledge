Alright, excuse me sir?
Uh, yeah I - I want to - to talk about you about something important to me.
Yeah, so I - so I know that you  actually uhm, disagree about my part-time job.
But I think I need this.  I think my part-time job -  I know it - it uh, negatively influence my study but I also need my - my job to - to support my financial.
I need the job because I need the money to continue my college also because I think, uh that the scholarship is just paying for my - for my - what is it.
Yeah, my tuition.  But it's - it's - it doesn't provide for my daily life.  So I think I need this job.
Yeah.
Uh, actually my parents got uh, fired from their job.  So I have to stand but - by - by my own - by my own right now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, uh maybe I will find uh, an easier job. Like now I realize that I am having a harder job, but I - I will find an easier one.  So I can still, uh, increase my GPA so you don't get mad at me.  But also I still got the money.
I am actually a - a - a waitress.
Yeah.
Uh, at one of the restaurant, the fast food one.   
Uh so I work, uh, at minimum six hours per day.
From after the college - after the class until the six hour done.  It is just flexible.  It is flexible.  As long as I have these six hours a day, I am fine.
Because after being a waitress, I also have to uh - you know for getting more money, I - I also have to - I - I actually need to doing the dishes.
Yes.
Yeah, of course sir.
Yeah.
Yeah, think you sir, thank you so much.
