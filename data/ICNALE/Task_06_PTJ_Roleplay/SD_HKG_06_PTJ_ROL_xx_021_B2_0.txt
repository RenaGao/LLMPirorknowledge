  Uh, I know that, um, having a part-time, uh, now is, uh, kind of, um, like disturbing my learning process because, uh, I use - or spend lots of time on working and put a lot of effort in working.  And I almost overlook my, um, academic things, but there are several reasons that why I need to work because, um, first of all, I think, um, because I study in a college that means, um, which means I am adult and I don't want to rely on my parents frequently, so I wanted to financial independence.  And then, I work for myself and I use my own money and I don't have to, um, increase their social - increase their financial burden.  And then, um, secondly because I - I am in underprivileged, which means that I am not rich at all so I - and then I don't want to, um -   um, out - more outcomes but less income, so I want to make a balance.  So, um, it's easier for me to handle some and adapt.  And, thirdly, I think, um, having a working experience is, um - having a working experience can help me to, um, build a pathway for me because you gain lots of experience and you expand your social network so that you know - when you graduate from a college and you can use your own experience to solve your problems in future.
Maybe, um - maybe I talk to my manager, see whether can I, um, work less, maybe, um - maybe from five times a week to - reduce to, um, twice a week so that, um, I can have more time to handle my assignment, my project, examination.
