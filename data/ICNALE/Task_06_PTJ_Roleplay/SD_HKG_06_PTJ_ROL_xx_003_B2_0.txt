Uh, um, I need my part-time jobs - uh, job because I really need money for my, uh, for my spending in my spare time because, uh, I don't have much money in my family and other than that I need to pay my parents for their XXX   and I hope that you can give me back my job.
Uh, actually, I can learn how to dealing with other people in my job and this is an ability that, uh, uh, an university student must have and I don't think doing a part-time job will harm my study.
Um, actually, I always study after school and I only use the time to go to - go for the part-time job only if I am day off.
Yes but at least I can do something for them.
