I just want to improve my teaching skill and I want to earn my money, so I don't like ask for my parents money anymore.
I - actually I can provide - I can like - I know what I am doing and I can like the time - can find the time to study and I also find the time for working in the same time.
Yes, I think it's a little bit tired, but it's okay because I - I just want to - I - I just want more experience to work with other people.  That - that is really improve my skill.
I - um, I agree with you but I - I just want to like - I - I just love teaching and if I have this skill and in the future I could like find jobs easily.
Yes.
Actually, I always - I sent my assignment to the teacher on time and I can work in the same time and then I think I can do these two thing in the same time.
I don't think so because I - I keep doing this, I keep teaching since I was in the first years of the university and then I am now a third year student and my grades are still the same and I don't think it will get thing better because I stopped teaching for one semester and it's still the same.
Okay.
