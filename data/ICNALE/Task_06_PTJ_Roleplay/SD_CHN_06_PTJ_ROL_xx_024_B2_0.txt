Hey.  Okay.  Well, ... I have to start?
I'm sorry.  Well, hello professor.  Um, actually, I wanted to talk about my part-time job stuff with you today.  Well, I know you think it's to negatively influence my study and research, but I just - I don't want to - to give it up, so - well, because I think it can improve my ability of communication, which I think is very important in my further study and my further, like, daily life.  More importantly, I have to get my salary because I - I don't want to lay it all on my families because I'm - yeah, you know, an adult after all.
Well, thank you for thinking it that way but would you please just let me keep one of them?  I'll - I'll try to cut my working hours.
Well---.
But - well, I think you're right, but I do need some - something else to - you know, to - to chill out, to - well.
But some day I'll have to pay it back.
With interest.
But you know this thing is in future is very uncertain.
