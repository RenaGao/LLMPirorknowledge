Hi.  Professor, I just want to, um, continue my part - part time job.
Okay, um, I agree with you but I think a good - uh, part time job cannot, um, influence my study---
Hmm, yeah, I think so but, hmm, actually this part time, the part time job, um, uh, um, I - I really learnt a lot from it and, uh, um, while I study I can more harder to earn - can, uh, work hard to my study and in turn not, um, uh, and I will do the, uh, part time job and study, uh, better and---
You know, sure, maybe I can reduce the time, um, uh, on the part time job and use more time on my study.
Even though there is, uh, only 20 - uh, 24 hours a day, I can't use all the time to my study.  I need a break.
Um, but I would - when, um, I do my part time job, um, I feel kind of, uh, relaxed, and then it can---
Yeah, but I think, um, if I, uh, um, I have the, um, social experience, it will help my, um, uh, it will help me to find a job in the future.  So um, be used in the future I think.
