Yes.  So, ... professor, I really want to insist my part-time job because first I need money.
It's a main reason and, second, I don't think the part-time job is wasting my time because, uh, I can meet, um, many different people and, uh, besides the school, I can, uh, willing to the social life, so I think it's a good experience for me, uh, although you think, um, it - it influence my study, uh, I will promise to you, I won't let my studies - uh, I will, uh, insist my studies and, um, I will get the good grades in the final test.
Okay, I see but, umm, if there is opportunity, I can find a internship about my major, uh, I will transfer my part-time job into the internships so I can, uh, continue making money and my research.  I think that's the best way to, uh, solve the problems but now, um, before I found the internship, I want to continue my part-time job.  I think, uh, that might - might not be to now for me to find the new internship about a - a consult about my major.
Uh, umm.  Maybe 3 days?
That's okay?
Uh, uh, 5 days but, uh, not 8 hours but a day it's about, uh, 4 hours a day, uh, I think that might be, um, okay I - it's a - it's all.  I can't say it's easy for me but I can - uh, 4 days, I can, um, I can take it.
