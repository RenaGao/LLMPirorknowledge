Um, first of all, I really love the job - this job and I think this is the passion that you cannot stop me from doing this job because it's like I have my freedom to choose what I like to do and what I do not.  And also you're not my, um, guardian so you cannot pro - prohibit me from doing anything that I am doing, I am actually a - adult now.  I'm not anymore a minor.  And also doing this part-time job is also, uh, a very good chance for me to enrich my CV because being a - a year-three student I actually don't have much time left to prepare for my career and also my future life and that's why this part-time job will actually, uh, give me more benefits than, um, shortcomings.  So, this is actually why I think I should keep on working instead of like what you said that, um, this job will give me, uh, bet - a shortcoming on my learning.  And also I actually have a very good grade so I don't think, uh, my good time management will, um, uh - and also my good time management can help me, uh, to manage my time, arrange my studies and everything, yes.
Uh, my timetable, um, is that very - I think it's a very good one, at least I have, uh - I really have planned for it when I was, um, putting everything together into my timetable.  I keep all my lessons on - uh, in the morning so that I can off at a very early hour like, uh, at least I will leave on campus at around, uh, 1 and the latest will be 2, so um I can work after, um, and throughout the whole afternoon, and then I will get off from duty, um, at a - in - at a - in the evening, so I can maintain my study and also my work and also I can keep myself XXX   and so after work I - I will still have time to prepare for my homework and also my studies.  So, no worry for my exams.
