Um, okay, um, professor---
---um, although you want me to, uh, creates the word, but I think I will - I will, um, arrange my time perfectly to do the study and my assignment and also the work at the same time.  I think I can control the time.
But, um, I think student cannot only study---
And we need to have a - I think the work is the time that we can, uh, use the moments and the - uh, the time that we can catch - we can touch with the, uh, real society and we can, um, have more, um, experience in the real society to make us know, um, more pictures in the - in nowadays society.
Uh, um, if I wait for that time, I think it's - uh, it's quite less for me---
Because when - and now I'm a student---
---and I have the time to go to the intern or to, um, do some small work to, um, do with training and this is very important for, um, the student now.
We cannot only have the, um, knowledge or, um, XXX  they make learning only.  We - I think we need to more to, um - and apply what we learn to make us more better.
Okay, these - uh, these parts I will do my best to make me to - and have a better - um, better - uh, to make my homework or assignments and project better, but---
I will control my time and maybe I will go to associate with my, um, um, my boss and I think the, uh, time control is the lesson I need to, um - I need to, um, um - I need to improve.
Um, not - not really, it's - it depends on, um - the - after I reschedule my - my schedule, I will - um, I will make it perfect to me.
Okay.
