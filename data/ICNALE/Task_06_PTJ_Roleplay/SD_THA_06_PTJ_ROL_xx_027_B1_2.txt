Okay.  Um, knock - knock - knock or something.
Good morning.  Um, about our talk last time, I think - I don't want to quit my job.
I don't think so because I can even my time - uh, I work part-time at night, but I can wake up early to get to your class and also I have never missed your class, also your assignment, I can - in time, so I think I don't want to quit my job because I want to challenge myself to make sure that in the future if I have job and I can arrange by - by myself.
It - uh, it's tired at first but when I get used to it, I think I can handle and if I work hard this time - this time, I think if something - if I encounter something harder, I will like have - I will pick up this experience to motivate me in the future.
Don't worry, I won't be distract by my job, yes.  I have encountered this situation before last year, so I think I can handle it.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes.
Yeah, thank you.
