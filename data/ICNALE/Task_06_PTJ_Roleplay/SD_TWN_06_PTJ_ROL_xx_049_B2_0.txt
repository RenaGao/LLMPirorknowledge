Okay, hi, Professor.
Uh, I'm Allan and, uh, I really want to have part-time job, so.
Uh, why?
But I'm a college student, not just in senior high school.  So, maybe I can have part-time job with my study.
Uh, because the experience for a part-time job is also important in my life, not just only study.
Uh, but if you want to apply a job in your future, but your boss, uh, find that you did not have any work experience in your college, then just only study, then they may, uh - he or she may think that you don't have, uh, enough experience.
Uh, but sometimes, you know, college, uh, also wants students not just study.  They also have some practical courses to let students working in a workplace.
So, do you have any, uh, suggestions for me?
Uh no, it is not about my part-time job.  Maybe, I can balance my study with my work, part-time job.
Uh, maybe I can arrange the last working, last, uh - last time to work and then focus more - focus more on to my study.
Uh, yes.
Uh, yes.
Uh, yes, I can just reduce my working hours.
Uh, no, maybe I can reduce like, uh, if I have class, then - and then, I will - I want arrange my working hour before, uh, before the day, yes.
Okay.
