So I think, yes, uh, I will - I will - I will do better in my studies, I promise you.
Well, uh, SENSEI , um, thank you for the - for the - for the trust on me and - but I - I will do better after October, and I will apply for a new scholarship in September.  And if it is - if I got - if I get them, I promise I can do better.
