Because actually I am not from a rich family.  So yes, I have to work part-time job to like - because you know that after doing my research, I have to like pay to get the data and something.  So I have to work part-time job.
Yes.
I - I already do all of that and I don't get any.  And so maybe I - I will doing   my part-time job and I will try to get the scholarship.  And when I get the scholarship, maybe I will not doing my part-time job.
But maybe if I can my - I can make my graduate maybe better again, again, yes.
Actually, because part-time job is the - the exact time, so I will just do my part-time job and the other time I will use for my study and research.

Okay, thank you.
