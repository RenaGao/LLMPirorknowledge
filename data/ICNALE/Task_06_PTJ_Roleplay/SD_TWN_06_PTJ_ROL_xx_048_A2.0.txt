Just, um, because, uh, my parents want me to independent, so you don't have, uh, it - they don't give money to me.  So, I have to make money to study college.  And then, study college is for the - just future to do a job.  So, study English, I - I think study  - I must study to - then, study in a college to make the money, but I don't have money to study college.  So, I have to just make some money to let me can study college.
Yeah, yeah.
Because, uh, the - the bank perhaps now - now lend me the money and then in - in the - the - just, uh, I - I don't know how to work to say.  Just, uh, I borrow money from the bank, the bank will---
Yeah, pay more, yeah, yeah.
But if - but if I focus on my study, I just - um, I can have money, yeah, just to pay the money to study in college.
Um, uh, so I think, um, I - I can - just I do my best to do the, between study and part - part job.
Balance it, um, like, um, you can go - uh, you can do the part job in the weekend.
Yeah.
Okay.
