Uh, I am so sorry for like missing the class.  You know I am quite introvert person.  So, I - I thought I needed some like social experiences.
So, I chose to work.
During with my free time.  But - but that was really my fault I'm missing the classes.  So, but I - I really want to do this.  Uh, I - I want to do this, so.
