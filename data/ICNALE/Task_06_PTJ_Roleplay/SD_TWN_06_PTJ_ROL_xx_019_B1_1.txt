Okay.  Um, I need to work my part-time job because, uh, I need more chance to communicate with people and it is a very important ability to my work.  Yeah.
Um, because when I go to the club or something, uh, we are classmate and we are the same place.  But when I was working my customer is more high-level.  Yeah, I - I need to, uh, uh, change myself and to, uh, do what they want.
I think it is an ability that I need to learn.
Uh, I think that is, uh, another thing that I need to learn, uh, learn to balance my - what I want to do and my, uh, schoolwork.
I think I need - maybe I need more, uh, more money and I can, uh, for me to do the things another one.  And the schoolwork, I think I will do more hard.
Um, when I do my part-time work, I met many friends there.
And I think they are important people in - in my life.
