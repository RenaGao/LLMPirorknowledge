Um, I'm - first, I'm sorry, for that.  I, uh - I have the work, um, from part time and, uh, I didn't have enough time to study.  Um, but, uh, the reason that - or I took this work---
---is, uh, that first I want to, uh, save money for my, uh, um, for my trip, uh, after graduate.  Um, and then this job I take - I took is, uh, is relative to, uh, to our major.
Um, so, uh, after I graduate, I want to do some works, uh, um, do some works in this, uh, re - in this---
Region.
Oh, in this field, uh, yes, in this field, uh, and the, um, and the boss of the company, uh, he told me that if I want to, uh, stay in his company, after I graduate, he - he welcome, uh, me to go there.
Uh, so I - I had to, uh, do this work.
Uh, yes.
Yes.
Uh---
Um, but, uh, I think, uh, uh, the, um---
  Uh---
Um, I often do work, uh, in for 4 hours---
---uh, every day and not the, uh, weekend.
Uh, so I just use the weekend and other times, uh, in the day, uh, to study.  And I promise, uh, to working - to work hard - harder---
---and not to influence my, uh, study.
Thank you.
