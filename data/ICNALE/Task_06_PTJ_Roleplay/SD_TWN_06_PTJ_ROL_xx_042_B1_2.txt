Okay.  Uh, Professor---
---I really want to do the part-time job because, uh, you know, education is not everything, it can help me, but if I want to be in part of the society, I have to learn to work one day, so I think part-time job is a good opportunity.
But professor---
---uh, do you agree that a student who is really working hard in his or her, um, study will not encounter any difficulty in the future?
Yes.
But it's my life, I have to learn to deal with it, so if I - as you know, I'm exhausted because I'm taking the part-time job---
---so it's my task to solve this, not just avoid to face it.
I will lose something definitely, but I will also gain something, right?
And also experience.
No.
I can gain my experience later.
But why do you think study is the most important thing now? 
But I think a student is not just about study, student means you are a learner, right?
So---
Learn something from the school and also the society.
So, this is the task I'm working on, uh, I have to learn time management.
Yeah.
Like you say - you think study is the most important thing for me now---
---so I will put study to my priority.
---and then I will think about job, so, uh, after school when I finished study, I can have the free time to do my part-time job.
Yes, I can't - I can reduce my working hour, but still working, uh, cannot be removed from my life.
Okay, thank you.
