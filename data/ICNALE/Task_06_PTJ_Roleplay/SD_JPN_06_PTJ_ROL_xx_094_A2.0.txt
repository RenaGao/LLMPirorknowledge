 Hello! Um, I'm going to study abroad in this summer vacation, so I need much money to study abroad.
 Oh, it is important to study English, but if I don't   much money to go abroad, I can't go study.
 My parents said half of the money to study abroad, you should pay.
 Oh, I want to, um, study abroad for maths   but if I money from --- if I get money from government, I have to study XXX   to study abroad.
 Oh.
 Of course, I study abroad, but I have --- ah, I have some time to --- to work and working at the shop, um, where --- if I work at office, about a few years later I can't work --- I can't experience working others' shop, others' store.
 Um, when I --- when I work at shop, uh, I talk with the customers and it is very --- it is very helpful to --- to work --- uh, to work.  A few years later, it is very good experience.
 Thank you.
