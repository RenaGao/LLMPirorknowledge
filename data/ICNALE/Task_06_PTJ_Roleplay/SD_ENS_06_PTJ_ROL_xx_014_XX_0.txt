Yes, I would like to continue working part time and studying here at this university.
Um, because I don't come from a very wealthy family and I don't get that much allowance and in order for example to pay for my textbooks here at this university I have to pay it on my own.
Ah, no I haven't.
Currently I don't know and I guess this is the only way I can make that extra money to---
Okay.
All right, I was thinking about student loans but I heard stories of people who are 30 already and still paying off their student loans  
Scholarship, I have to like the top in my class and I don't think - my grades I have now, I don't think I am at that level too.
What if I do my best and if my grades recover, can I continue my part-time job?
I will - I will do my best but it's not only textbooks I need the money for. I don't think student loans will cover for example - to come here I need like gas money and, you know, food money  
And if my grades don't recover and I lose my part-time job, is the school still going to support me with cash?
Yes.
