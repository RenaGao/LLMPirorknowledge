Uh, good morning professor.
Uh, I - I need to take a part-time job for myself?
Yes.  But - yes.  Uh, uh, I think you are - you are right.  But - but, uh, as you know my - I am a - I come from foreign countries, uh, Japanese - now Japanese culture is really new or fresh for me so I, uh - I - I choose to do a part-time job is not only for making monies, uh, I think I want to know Japan better and Japane - improve my Japanese abilities  to have a further communication with you and our classmates.
And so I think it's us - also a better way for me to have a better understanding about Japan and our XXX  research.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes.
Oh, yes, uh, uh, but for me I think, uh, in school almost everybody is protected inside this en - environment because this environment is about knowledge, about learning, about studies but not about the real life.  I mean working outside or by myself and communicate with other like boss or part-time jobbers, I mean we - I can have a responsibility to do my part-time thing and got communication or respective from the other people.  I mean that's not only for improve communication but also it's a kind of a - a emotional improvement, I think.
