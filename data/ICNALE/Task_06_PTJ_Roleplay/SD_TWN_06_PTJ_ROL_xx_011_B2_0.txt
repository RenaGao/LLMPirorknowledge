Or I can help the skill like I can talk more and fluently.
And - and I can learn to and I can earn money to, um, I can earn money to support my - my spending.  So, I can - so I can, um, so my parents can be more - my parents can save more money.
Well, the classmates are the same age as me and when I do my part-time job in the store I can meet a lot of people that is, um, different from me and they can be children or old people.  So, I can learn to - I can learn to communicate with them.
