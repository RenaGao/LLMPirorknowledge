 But the government gave money to me - the money is, money is for, for the college but I have to earn my living - money to live.  For example, dormitories pay and food, and clothes, those   money is enough, uh, I have to earn those   money.
 If you want me to stop my part-time job and study, please give another way to - to - for me to live enough life.
