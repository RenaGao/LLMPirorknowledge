 But it is necessary for me to live --- to live my life and I --- it's necessary to earn money.
 But scholarship is --- if I use the system of scholarship in the future I should --- I should return the money and money and the --- the cost of this money is very huge.
 But as you say that I --- yeah --- I study very hard and --- and take a good grade so I can study and part-time job --- both.
 Sorry.
 It is true that --- that reduce time of a part-time job is a good idea.
   But --- but when --- if I do so, my supervisor will say you should quit.
