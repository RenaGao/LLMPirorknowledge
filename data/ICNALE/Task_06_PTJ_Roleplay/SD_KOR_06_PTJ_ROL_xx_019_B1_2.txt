Professor, I need to work as a part-time job.
Uh, I am teaching children at academy.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, right.
Um, okay, I thought that I need to - I need to experience, I need some realistic skill or teaching skill.  So, I chose to go there and work in there as a teacher.
Oh, maybe 5 days a week.
Um, 6 hours.
Mm-hmm.
Too much?
Yeah, it's sometimes, but I feel - I feel, um, alive when I teach children more than just listening to class, I'm sorry.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Immediately?
Mm-hmm, I see.  I really appreciate that you're concerned about me.  So, how about, uh - how about this?  If I reduce the time and let's say to working there and now, just focus, more focus on the study.
Okay, 10 hours.
Ten hours per week?
Okay.
Stop it - so, stop it?
Actually, I have one more reason that I work there.
I need money.  That's simple.
No.
For - for my, uh, entrance fee, for that.
Oh, yes.
Not loan.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
No, I'm not good at studying.
Okay.
No, it's not just silly things.
I think it's really important. 
It really is helpful to me.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
I will, yeah.
No.
