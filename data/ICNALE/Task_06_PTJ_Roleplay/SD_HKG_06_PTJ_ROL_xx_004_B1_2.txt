 .  Um, working part-time is, um, an experience that can help me to gain more - gain more experience or some, uh - to learn more things about this, uh, particular job and I would like to continue it because, um, it will not affect my studies.  I have arranged the study time that's, um, I can finish my - my study in college well and also, um, do this job good enough.  And, um, also this part-time job actually can help me to have more, um, help broaden - this job can help me broaden my horizons and, um, it can let me known - get to know more people and in the future this may help me when, um, when I graduate - graduate from college and I may know more about how to, um, deal with the job.  And this, um - this the - perhaps the advantages that this part-time job brings to me is more than the disadvantages.
Um, actually, the timeta   - I can arrange the timetable in the college and maybe I can put most of the classes in, uh, maybe the in 3 or 4 days and then the - the other days I can go to work but when it is the days for my studies then will - I will not go to work and I can - um, can do with my lessons well and will - and I can also go to work on time.
Um, maybe, 3 days or 4 days because the lessons can be put in - like put in the one day and I can look - have the lessons from the morning to the afternoon, so, um, then the rest of the days will be free for me to go to the work.
Uh, maybe, the time will be quite tight for - um, it can be managed because, um, like working outside the class is also aim and a time for practice and it is meaningful so it is not just consuming my time.
