Um, I - I am - uh, I am glad, sir, you gave me your, uh, advice about, uh, persuade - persuade me of giving up my part-time job.
And who will be the first to speak?
Okay.
Hello, do you have something to say to me?
Yes, I also have that feeling too, but right now, I am run out short of money.
I really need money to pay my tuition or something, to - to support my living in here.
Thank you for your suggestion, but really I can - I think I can find a better way to balance study and working because - and if I can find the balance between study and working, then I can---
What if - what if I can continue my study and don't let my, um, study get worse, and continue my working at the same time.  That is a win-win type situation.
Um, some people also often - also say the same thing to me like what professor you told me and - but actually right now I - I have no other choice because I can get any other support - financial support because I have to rely on part-time job to support everything in - because money is all I need right now.  Because if you have no money, you cannot continue your study, and you cannot continue your study, your future will become no hope.
That's what I am trying to say next. 
Because I can't give up my part-time job, doesn't - it doesn't mean I cannot make my part-time job time shorter.
