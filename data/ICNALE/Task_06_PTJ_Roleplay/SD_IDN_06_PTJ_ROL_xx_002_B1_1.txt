Excuse me sir.
So someone's told me that you called me?
I am so sorry sir.  But this part-time job is my life like I - I am now having my - I - I have to pay my tuition fee like half of it.  So, I still have to do that.  And for the - the living, the living cost is also not that high and not that cheap.  So I still have to do that.  But I am trying my best to balance between my study and my - my part-time job.
Yeah, like right now they have their own difficulty.  So that's right, I am helping them - I am helping them.  But I didn't tell them about it.
Uhm, like right now uh my sister still on her master degree.
And her - her scholarship is over and my - my - my younger brothers are going to high school and there you need more money for it.  So.
Uh I'm trying my best to if - if there is like crashing   schedule, I will change my schedule in my part-time job with another workers, so I still can do my part-time job in another time.
Uh, I work in a coffee shop.
