So, I'd like to meet this.  I need to - to continue to work on my part-time job since I - I have a - I have academic loans.  I have - I have - I need to earn some salary to - to support my daily - daily life.
But if I - I can do - I can - I can support myself on my part-time job, I will get a sense of accomplishment.  And as to the scholarship, I see it's not really enough for - for me to support my daily life since I have to - I have to offer some money to my - my home since my parent was - was confined to the bed, confined - confined in a bed for a long time since they got cancer and some disease, so I need to earn a lot of money as much as possible.
Yes.  But I can - I can use my time really in efficiency - in efficiency way since I will try - try my best to make good use of my time.  When I get out of work, I - I can - I - I can also study.  It may not to increase my academic performance, so.
But since I am a teenager, I have a - I have a really nice physical condition to - to overcome the obstacle in my life.
How can I be sure?  Since I - I really - I often go jogging, uh, uh, on my weekends so I think, I - my - my - my health is really nice.  So, uh, professor, you need to worry about my - my physical condition.
