Okay.  Uh, excuse me, sir?
Uh, can I have your time?
All right.  So, I am one of your uh, student.
Okay, uh, so I heard that uh, you want to talk something about my part-time job.
Okay, yeah, I can understand why you are telling me to quit my part-time job.  But uh, I - I think that you need to know the reason.
Because I really need this job, like I want to live apart from my parents.  And this semester is like my first time ever doing this part-time job.  So, like, I need some time to like feeling comfortable doing this job and also doing the uni, like all of my task as student.  Like this is my first month I think, like I - I promise you that I can be better like next month and next semester.
Yeah, it's - it's not that hard like I only have to do this job like from evening to like 9 p.m.
Yeah and then, like actually I can do my task as a student like after 9 p.m.  But this is my first months, like I need - my body also needs some time to feel comfortable doing these things.
Yeah, yeah, that's what I said before that I do not really do my task.  So, I do my task like in the afternoon where I am supposed to be in a class.  Yeah, maybe that's the reason why.
Yeah, like  
Yeah, I promise that I have to be - yeah, I, I understand that I have to be there like anywhere I, I was doing, like I have to be a student in an uni.  So yeah, I have to do my task at night and then I have to do it very efficiently so I still can be able to attend my class.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
