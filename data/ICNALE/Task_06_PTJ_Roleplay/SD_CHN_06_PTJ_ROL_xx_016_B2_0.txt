Hi.  Hi professor.  Well, I'm now currently taking a part time job.
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe, do you think, uh, may I ask why?
Well, at first, I thank you very much, I appreciate that.  Well, and this is reason that the - uh, that the part time job because now currently I don't have, well, enough money for my living necessary, because I'm, well, you know, I come from a - not a money family.
Yeah, I realize that, that's I - that's why I want to, well, also study hard and then maybe, well, ease my pressure from the - from money part because I lack of money.  I don't want to la - anything concerned amount money impact, well, impact, ah, affect my real, my passion on the research.
Maybe I - maybe I will try to reorganize my time table and then move my, well my part time job time - well just behind - behind everything about the research and study.  I think maybe - well, maybe I can cut off the time XXX  and then, maybe, 2 hours or 3 hours of part time job maybe, I think.
Ah.
Ah, maybe for me, I - I think I will, well, staying in the campus for all days working - efficiently working, maybe I think, well, after long day's work - uh, after a long days of research, I can go to the working place and then help me, you know, a little bit re - a little bit relief about and then cut off, forget everything about the research, all the problems I go through.
Hmm, maybe some way it can ease me, well, maybe in the moods, that I can, well, well, better - well, forget everything, uh, every problem that I go through in today's world, you know, for like the difficult questions that I have to - I have to solve maybe, and on the other hand I can, you know, earn some money and then, well, try to relief my, well, not to have so much pressure, financial pressure on my parents side.
