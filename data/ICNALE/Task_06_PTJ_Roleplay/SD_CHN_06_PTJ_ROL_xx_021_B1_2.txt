Hello, well, professor?
I'm very sorry to bother you, but, um, I have to say I would like to continue my part-time job first.  Reason is because, um, my family didn't give me enough money for my life, so it's very necessary for me to continue my part-time job.  And if there are any other part-time job for something like teacher assistant in our school, could you please just introduce it to me?  I think maybe that kind of job are more suitable for me because when I am doing it, I can also, um, try to use my knowledge that I learned in - from my research.  I think it's better for my study, and I can get money at the same time.
Hmm.
Yes and no.  The - so, I would like to, um, but, um - I - I really need some money for my - money for my life, so---
If it's possible, I would love to do that.
Umm, uh, umm.
Umm.
Umm.
Um, um, oh my god.  ... Um, so, if - if there is any job I can, um, improve my research skill and I can earn money at the same time, I think it's the best choice for me.
