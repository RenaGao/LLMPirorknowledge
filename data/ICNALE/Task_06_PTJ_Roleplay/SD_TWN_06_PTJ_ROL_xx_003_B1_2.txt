Okay, um, I think that doing this part-time job can make me learn some experience that I can't learn from school and that is very important for me when the future I am going to live, career, my career.
Uh, like well, how to interact to with people and also some communicative skills.
Well, the - the most different thing is that it's very professional in the - in the part-time job.
Well, it's like - well, uh, it's like when you are in the job, you have the duty to do this thing, do a thing as well as you can, because it - it turns out like how much money you get paid, but while in college or in school, how much you learn won't actually affect how much you get.  Also you - I will do more efforts when I can get more things.
Well, I think that it is my choice to choose what - what kinds of things I like, because um, last semesters, maybe I think that even though my grade is better, but I think I can learn so much things as I am doing part-time job.
Well, when I try to do part-time job, I think that the things I learn is more useful for me.
Well, I think that the top grade and the scholarship is not everything I need, because the experience is more important for me than the scholarship and the grade.  So, yes, it's my choice.
