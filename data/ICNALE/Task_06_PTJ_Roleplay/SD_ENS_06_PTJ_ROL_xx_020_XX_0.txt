Hi.  Yeah, you called me to your office?
Right.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh, no, it's not due to work.
Recently, I've just lost some - some of my motivation for studying.
Yeah, I think the classes have not been as interesting as they were  .
A few months ago.
Okay.
Ah, I didn't realize there was a relationship between the two.  I guess I've been working too hard.  I haven't realized.
Okay.
For example?
Uh.  Yeah, I have considered getting a student loan; however, my parents earn a lot of money, and the government has been unwilling to lend me money because they've said that my parents should be able to fund my education.  However, they are not funding my education, so I need to be doing a part-time job like I am now to support myself.
I'm here to study, but I also need to survive in this world.
Okay.  Umm, I would really like to keep my job, so what would you think if I suggested that I cut back even just a little bit on my working hours  .
Hmm, I can't afford to cut down a lot, but maybe  .
But I'm really struggling to get by even though I am working quite a lot, so cutting down a lot is really not an option for me.
Maybe - well, currently I am working about 25 hours a week, I'm thinking maybe I could cut back to 20.  I could take Thursday night off.
Five is - no, that's - that won't work.
