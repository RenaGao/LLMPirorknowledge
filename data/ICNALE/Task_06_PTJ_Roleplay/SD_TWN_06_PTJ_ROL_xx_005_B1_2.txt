Uh, I think this job is very, very important for me, because I - I would like to make some money for buying something I want.
So, I think I will still continue with this job.
Uh, I don't want to - want them to - to uh - I don't want to use their money.  I think I can do it myself---
---to lead my life.
But I think it is a - an experience that I can use my experience in my future, my work, hmm, that I do.
How to deal with customers, because there are a lot of people in this world and you may, hmm - you may - you may not fulfill everyone, but you have to deal with them in a good manner.
Hmm, I think it - it is different, because when you are a staff, when you face the customers, you - you have to - you have to know your head.  You have to control your temper and control your behavior.  You can do everything you want and you - you don't - you can't say anything you want to say.
Maybe you are right, but I think---  
I think I have to just strike a balance between them.
