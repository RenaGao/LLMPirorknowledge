I think it is important to do part-time job before I went to - I went to do all-time work.
And, uh, that's my case and I - I think this part-time job will not affect my study and also it can make me - uh, know what I - I am studying now.
Um, because this part-time job is - um, is consists with what I will do in my future.
It - it - uh, I need to, uh, schedule the   - I need to collect, uh, the patient, uh, - the, uh---
Yes.
And also - also do, uh - I can learn by watching work because - because I - I am going to be the doctor.  So, I can learn by watching what they're doing---
---that is my part-time - it's my part-time job.
But I have - I have known some - I have known my - I have no - one of my friend, she is also studying medical and she went to a part-time job and accordingly, uh, she went to work because of the part-time job and - before her classmate---
---went to work.
So I think I can do just that - what she do.
