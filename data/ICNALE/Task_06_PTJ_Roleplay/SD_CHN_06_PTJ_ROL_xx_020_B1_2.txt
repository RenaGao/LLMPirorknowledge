Hello, yeah.  Um, sorry professor, and I am - I - I mean I am answering this question.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, sorry.  I am really - uh, I really need this money and or I can't afford the money to pay for my whole - uh, my whole college money, and I think it's, uh - if I - if I stop this part time job, I think my life will be hard, and I can't keep the balance between the study and life. So if - if I can do the job in - in the seminar or in the college, I think I will stop it, or if you - if professor can't support me, or offer me a part time job, I think I still want to do the part time job.
Uh, yeah, but you know, it's not that we - before as a researchers, we - I am a human in the society and the money is the - uh, is very important to me.
Yes, but now I'm still have not, uh, uh - I still am not any - uh, any - anything can show the others that can prove myself, and I think it's very hard to borrow the money from bank or the other companies.  So, I think I still need this part time job.
Shorter time?  Yes, shorter time.
Um, okay, but you know, I - sorry, I still need to do the work and to - to buy the food for - for the payment of my - of my - my living and if the teacher or the school can support me some, I mean, like a scholarship, I - I'd like to short my part time.
