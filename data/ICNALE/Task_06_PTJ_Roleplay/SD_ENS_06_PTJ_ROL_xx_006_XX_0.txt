Uhm, well, I understand you want me to stop working part time but I really would like to continue as I really need to save up money.
I don't necessarily disagree but and I - if I am - I can understand if I am at the borderline of expulsion.  But school and education is not cheap, especially in this economy right now.
So I'm doing the best I can to try and pay for it as my parents and my scholarships alone do not cover all the expenses.
Hmm, well, am I - am I at the point where could be expelled from school?
Well, I agree, again as I said at the - the student's primary job is of course to achieve good grades, but I think it's very good to at least maintain a healthy work and also study life balance just because then I am able to became a more balanced person.  I'm learning a lot of responsibilities and I'm learning a lot on the job, besides just what I'm learning at school from my text books.  Some things need to be learned I think from experience as well.
Well, I'm learning a lot of how to work with people.  With studies at least I don't really get that from a textbook, but by working with people I can see what people are interested in.  I have to of course answer to my supervisors at my part-time job.  I have to try and manage my time properly with my coworkers so that everyone can sort of be satisfied   .
Financial?  To assist me financially?
That's - that's good.  I'm - I'm very happy that those options exist, but again also the - I���m learning a lot more from the job itself.  It also has an experience as well that I think is going to help me in the future after graduation.
