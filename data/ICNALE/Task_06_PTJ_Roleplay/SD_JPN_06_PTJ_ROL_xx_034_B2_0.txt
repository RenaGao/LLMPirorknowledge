 Umm. Right now, I am doing my part-time job because I really need some money for studying abroad because in coll --- uh when --- during my university student I was thinking to go to study abroad and then studying abroad costs me a lot of money, so I really need to get some money.
 Yeah, but --- but I am doing my part-time jobs   because I want to study abroad and then I am doing it because I want to study.
 But studying a long time is not like it's not very important for, you know, getting a grade because longer is --- it --- is --- is not necessarily umm how to say like --- it's umm um it doesn't mean that longer you study better you --- better grade we get, so what I want to say is like, you know, I think the most --- umm --- the best way --- and the most important thing is to concentrate, like how well we can concentrate on something, how can --- how well we can concentrate on studying.
 So, it doesn't mean that umm we have to study longer --- for a long --- for a long time.
 So even though if we --- if I do my part-time job and then I could concentrate on my studying and then have a good grade, I think that will be okay, yeah.
 Yeah, that is actually true but umm I also want to have some experiences and like other than university, so like umm I want to know how to communicate with customers and also, yes, I want to know about manners --- you know social manners, so I think that kind of experience is also, you know, beneficial for me, yes.
 Yeah.
