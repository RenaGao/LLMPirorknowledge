I think, um - good morning, madam.
I, I - I heard that you would like to see me today because of my studies.  First of all, I - I am very sorry because, uh, my work has affected my studies negatively---
---but I would like to continue my part-time work.
Yes, I am sure.  Because - okay - the first reason I would like to work part-time right now is because I want to support my financials.  And we  didn'  get a loan from XXX   because I would not like to burden myself in the future by paying it monthly.  So, I would like to support myself by working part-time.
My plan is, during my part-time work, I will work like normal, but during - during my free time, I - I can do many extra exercises on the topic that I don't understand.  And I could - I can - I can meet my lecturer personally if I don't understand any topics.  So, that will make me more, um - that will make me more relevant for me to work right now.
Yes, I can.
Yes.
Sure.
