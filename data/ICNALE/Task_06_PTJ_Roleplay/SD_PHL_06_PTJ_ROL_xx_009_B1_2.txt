Alright.  So about my part-time job, uh, it's actually because I need to be self sustaining and I don't want to always burden - to burden my parents to let's say, asking them for my salary every time I go to school.  I want to ease my burden with them by getting a part-time job in order - in order to do the things that I want to do at the same time be more productive, and not bothering.
No, not really.  It's---
I do it on my own.
Ah yeah, that's true.  I may have little - I may little XXX   around my part-time job.  It's just that I am very committed to lowering the burden of my parents especially when I am enrolled in such a exquisite school like XXX  .  The tuition fee is little too high for my parents alone to handle, so I have to take a part-time job.
I am expected to do well, but since I am not necessarily falling behind I should be able to maintain the balance.  I may not be an excellent student, but I work just hard enough to maintain my grades properly.  So I think I can maintain both my work and my schooling.
Well, that's not me then.
I am going to have to tell my principal that if I am going to do that.
Alright.
