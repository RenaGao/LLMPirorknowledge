Hi!
Well, uh, I see that you don't want me to continue my part-time job.
Yeah, but I believe I am doing well in my research study, my - uh, grade in classes and my presentation in class hasn't dropped down I think.  I think so.
It is true that it will be exhausting, but, uh, I am able to arrange - manage the time and I can thoroughly study, so it does not, uh, disturb my study at all.
Well, I gain experiences and money, of course, and, uh, I start feeling that I cannot relied on my parents anymore, I mean, I will be at the top student, I have to take responsibility for myself.
Um, uh, you can - I can guarantee you by showing you my works, my study, my reports in - I am getting from that.  If my - uh, grade has dropped down, I promise I will quit.
Yes.
Okay.
