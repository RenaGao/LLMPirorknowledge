Uh, but sir, I just want to, you know, do something with my studies to, uh, afford my studies.
Not to be dependent on my parents.  So that's why, I think every student should part - uh, do part-time jobs if they have time.
So, mm, because if you just study and dependent on your, uh, uh, parents, after you studies, what you - you should - you have to you know start with the beginning.  So, if you are doing part-time jobs, you have experience with your degree.

Uh, if you, uh, see in Europe, there if a student is, you know, more than 20 or 22, they force to - uh, they force them to you know work and, uh, it's my personal experience, my sister is there and she, you know, they demand for loan of - in - in her Masters but they don't allow her.   They said that, you know, you have to do a job for you - because you are in age that you know you should be independent.  
So I think if---
