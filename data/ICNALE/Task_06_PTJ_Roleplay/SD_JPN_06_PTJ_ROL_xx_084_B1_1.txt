 Hello.
 I --- I don't want to quit my part-time job.
 I want to continue the part-time job for my life because uh I have the some reasons.
 First, I --- my umm my part-time job is the teacher at cram school.
 Umm, I --- in cram school there are some students I teach every week.
 If I quit the job the students will be --- will have some troubles --- some --- or some problems if uh because the teacher changes suddenly.
 I --- I think I have to the --- prepare time to shift other teachers and---  
 Actually, the change of the teachers, so it occurs very often at the cram school.
 Hmm.
 That --- that reason was for the --- for my students but I have also, the reason for me, I --- I want to be a   English teacher.
 So uh this part-time job is connected to my future job, so teaching skill or communicating with the students.
 And so umm and I am not a student majoring in education or ways to educate students.
 I am a major in literature, so I want to the experience to teach in Darwin University, so this part-time job is also my study for my future.
 Hmm.
 Reading literature is not uh just reading literature is boring.
 And it's umm I think literature has --- has to have more connection to society.
 And so just I --- if I just read every day I can't find the meaning of the existing of the literature, I---  
 Umm, if I just read --- read every day, umm, I cannot communicate with the society.
 Yes, I --- I know that, but I --- it is --- it may include uh fictional things and --- but I think the umm the whole study of university will be improved by the experience --- real experience in the society.
 So, I need the part-time job for me.
