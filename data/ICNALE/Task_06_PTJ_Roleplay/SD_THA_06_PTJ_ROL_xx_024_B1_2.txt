Uh, good morning teachers, so  
Would you - uh, my friend said you want to meet me?
Okay.  So, uh, I might stop doing that or something like that if it is affect on badly on my performance.
Yes, thank you so much for your concerned.  But actually, uh, as you can see that my project I have sent you, uh, is a really big project, and I need a lot of money to spend on them.  And my parents said that they couldn't handle - uh, couldn't afford them, so that's why I have to work as a part-time job.  And if you doesn't want me to do the part-time job, then are you have any way for me to, you know, uh, get some money for my project in the futures?
Yes, I - actually, I have asked - uh, the associate already and many of them said that they, uh, doesn't have - doesn't - doesn't have any vacancy for now, because they have, uh, a - a lot of my friends already taken all the seat, and there is nothing left for me to do.  So, one of my - uh, one of - I think it's one of your, uh, you XXX   uh, they actually, uh, give me this way to work part-time job because it doesn't - uh, you can choose, uh, the time that you can work and is - is very near to our university.  So, that's why I was, uh, working on that way out to you.  I am sorry for that.
Yes.
Yes.  I actually believe that I can do both of them, and I can manage my time with my project and my part-time.
Yes, thank you.
