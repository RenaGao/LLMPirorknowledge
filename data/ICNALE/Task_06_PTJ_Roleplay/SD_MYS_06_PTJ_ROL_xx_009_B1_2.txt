Good afternoon sir.
Sir, uh, uh, Mr. Lee you told me to stop working because you worry about my study  .
So, uh, actually, uh, I don't want to quit the job.
Because I really - I really need money to, uh, to pay for the academic fees and to buy my personal things, and also for my - for my daily expenses.
But, uh, I think, if I couldn't prefer to pay for the academic fees then how could I study, so, I think, that's the first thing I have to do.
Yes of course I can.
How!  Uh, I will make special timetable, uh, every day and I will put the most important work in the first place.  I will do the most important work first, and, yeah I will try to prioritize what I should prioritize - prioritize.
