Mmm, I think I need to continue my part-time job, because I want to keep studying hard without rest like - for like few months and also I want to buy car for my parents, because they paid me a lot since when I was young, but just - I just want to give them a present for, because I want to say thank you to them.
Like I want to just pay like - because when you buy a car, you just don't pay all of them in one time.
You just pay.
Yes.
Okay.
I think I can do both.
I do know that, but my father always said I just keep - just going - keep going best that you just - just every - keep going best in what you are doing.  So, I just - I'm going to focus on just those two and buy a car.
I agree with that.
But you know just, if you are a son, just you would want to be - be a good son - as good son to your parents and better - better at two things are better than, you know, better than only one thing.
