Uh, I think as a undergraduate student, uh, I think, uh, working, uh, as a part - as a part-time job member is essential for our studies, as we can learn more stuffs or more knowledge beyond textbooks.  Uh, for example, uh, when we learn to deal with customers or learn to deal with, uh, coworkers we can - uh, we can greatly broaden our horizons, uh, for about interacting with people or learning other new life skills when we are working outside.  And I think learning beyond textbook is important for our, eh, for me as a undergraduate as I think the car - career aspirations for me and the career experience is, uh, also important for my, uh - for my studying halfway, as, uh, when I finish, uh, my 4-year program for being a - an undergraduate student I have to enter our society and be one of the workers outside.  So I think gaining experiences, uh, in my, uh, studying halfway is important for my self-development and my holistic development to prepare myself for enter in - enter in the society.
I think I can balance time for looking outside and attending classes well, as I think, uh, our classes yeah, uh, many taken in the morning and I think outside classes I can work, uh, as part-time job members, uh, eh, at around 6 PM tom uh, 12 AM and at - at this times I can, uh, also earn more money and also earn more - and gain more experiences for my self-development.  So, I think I can balance the time well in these, uh, time slots.
I think my ability for balancing the workload and balancing the, uh, activities that are required by classes, uh, good and I can balance time well.
