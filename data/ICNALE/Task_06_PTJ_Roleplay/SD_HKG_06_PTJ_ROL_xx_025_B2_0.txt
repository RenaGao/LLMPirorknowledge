Yeah.  Uh, hello supervisor?  Uh, I really want my part-time job to be continue because I really need money for my tutorial class, uh, I have apply - uh, yeah, because I need to, uh - I need my money for my daily expense too, uh, because my parents didn't - didn't - they didn't gave me pocket money.  So, this, uh, part-time job is really essential to me.  So please give me a chance to work for you.
Yeah.  Uh, that's why I just put, uh, my lecture class, uh, in week, uh - in Monday to Wednesday.  Uh, therefore I will have two day off on first day and Friday and after all - after the class I have, uh, sufficient time for my revision and also the research and during the weekend, uh, I will have spent a lot of time on my, uh, researching too.  So, I believe I will have a lot of - will have enough time for my academic too.  So, still, please give me a chance.
Yeah, uh, that's why I choose a part-time job instead of full-time job, uh, I am - I have a good, uh, curriculum state because I have, uh, practice to be a very flexible time management student, uh, in my secondary school.  I have joined a lot of activities.  I have joined a lot of activities, so, uh, I know how to allocate the time.  Uh, in my spare time I usually, uh, reading books.  I think it's also help us - help me for my research, so, uh, I believe a good time management and good time allocation can help me, uh, to, uh, spend the time in working and in studying eventually.  So, I think it's still no problem for me.
