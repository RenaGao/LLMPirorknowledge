Hi!  Oh-oh, good morning.
Yes, my part-time job is to teach student English subject.
Um, from - from my point of view, I think that I can manage time to handle both of - both - uh, do project and do my part-time job.
Okay, but I think that it's a good way to do part-time job for me while I am doing research, because I can focus on doing both part-time job and doing research.
For me, yes, I feel tired but I think that it will, um, connected me to my - my attempt to do the - both research and part-time job.
Um, I said - um, I will - I will try - can you give me, uh, time to approve?
For me, um, yes, okay.  Sure.
Yes.
Thank you.
