Okay, um, now I have to continue my part-time job for several reasons, the first one is now the part-time job is actually related to my study and research, uh, so I can learn more practical skills from this part-time job to have me to, uh, finish my study and the research, um, better.  Secondly, uh, actually, there is some problem and some financial stress in my family, so it is very essential for me to do - to continue this part-time job, so I want to you to continue this part-time job now.
Um, actually I believe that I can keep the balance between the part-time job and my study, and about the recently - about my score, I think it is just about - about, uh, my - my concentration is actually not very enough, but now I - I reduce the time that I do this kind of part-time job so I can pay invest in more time in the study in the research so I believe I can do better than before. 
I think, uh, the very important one is to, um, improve my efficient, like I can, uh, do - I can learn with more concentration and so I can - I can use less time to finish the study and research.  So, I think it - it can become a - I can do better.
Okay.
