I feel, uh, now I am having a part-time job in a whole different, a local firm, a very small firm but I think they - it is very helpful because they got small numbers of employees, so they let me handle the whole project so I can learn every part, every, uh, details of the project.  So - and this is helpful, um, for my careers because if I want to become an auditor so I have to learn the procedure of pre - preparing an audit report, uh, computer test, uh, proper test so I think if I continue working in this role, I think I can learn, uh, hmm - it is good for my career, yes.
I think in college we, uh, emphasize on self-learning very much because you know, uh, many of us skip lesson but some of us can still get high grade in the final exam because we depends - we highly rely on our self-learning.  So, I think without a - without attending a class we can still learn it by ourself, the most important thing is that we - we - uh, we revise on the chapter and do the exercise they provided and this is a very difference if you do not do this good.
Uh, one good thing about the part-time job is that they really has the flexibility, so, uh, in my company I can, uh, take as many as leaves that I want but I can still keep up the, uh, process, because the - if I take a job I can finish it in I think XXX   so if I know that I need to have study or have mid-term or exams then so I will not take the job, so I will leave it and then also I am ready to, uh, work, so I will, uh, take a job.
