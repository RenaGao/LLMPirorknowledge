Hello, sir.
Can I disturb you?
So, first I want - I want to tell you sir that I am so sorry because I think that I want to take a part-time job and - and I heard that you disagree with my - my decision about that.
Yes, it's true  .
Sir, but so sorry mister, I am so sorry sir, because this job is really important to me.  If  .
If I cannot take this job, I cannot pay the fee and tuition and it will - will give affect to my study  
---too, something like that.  And it will - it will be decrease my study more and more because I can think to - to the different things besides it's about tuition fee.  And it will be - my parents will be like - my parents will be sad because they - they cannot - or they cannot affordable to pay my tuition.
Actually, I work part-time in a cake shop.  Actually, I can choose the time of the part-time.  Maybe if I take a morning - morning time and I will - I will study in afternoon time or the opposite, something like that.  So I think that it doesn't - doesn't disturb me enough.
And if you - if you permit me to - to still take this job, I will - I will promise you - I promise to you if I will increase or I will hard - I will be a harder study to this semester and I will increase my score, too.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you, Mister.
