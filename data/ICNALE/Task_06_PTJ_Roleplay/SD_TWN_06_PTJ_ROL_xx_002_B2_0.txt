Uh, the reason why I did my part-time job first is, because I need that money.  I don't have enough money to support my daily life.
Um, but I think working on a part-time job can make me learn something, uh, outside the textbook.
Um, I can deal with other people, um, outside the school.
But when I am in school, I won't have that pressure from other people, because, um, outside the school, I am not a student but the employer.
So---
Um, students are - we can make mistakes and they will forgive us, because we are students.  But when I am working outside, I need to try to make, um, less mistake as possible and I have the responsibility, um, for my job.  But at school, hmm, although we didn't do well on our studies or test, it will usually be, um, that's okay.
Um, then, I will try to handle my homework and assignment as, um, I can - I will try my best.
Yes.
