Uh, as a student I think work experience is really important to our future career and I think part-time is a very good chance for me to, uh - to equip myself as a very, uh - very prepared, uh - prepared man to, uh - to maybe competent to, uh - to the future careers job with others because I can gain experiences from, uh - from the job such as how to communicate with peoples and how to, uh - how to solve the problems in a very fu, eh - a very few second.  So I - I think part-time job is, uh - is really, uh, helpful for me, uh - to me.  And also I can be more independent as, I - this is a job, uh, but not studying and I am not protected by parents and also teachers and schools and all things I am - uh, are solved by myself.  And, uh, also I can earn money by myself and but not rely on my parents.  Uh, so I think this is really, uh, useful and important to me and it will affect me very, uh - in a better way.
I think this is not - this can also change, uh, maybe, uh - uh - uh, training of my time management because, uh - uh, how I adjust and how I use my time to study and also work at the same time is a really important stuff, uh, even in the future work.  So, uh, I think this is a good practice for me to adjust my time.
Uh, I would set a timetable and also, uh, I will focus more on, uh, studying, uh, during the exam period.  But, uh, I am not - I am going to, uh, continue my job, uh, at the same time but I - I am - believe that I can - I can still, eh, perform well in the exam.  And I - I - because I - I will - I have revise, eh, eh, do revision several times and I believe that I can, eh, do it well.
