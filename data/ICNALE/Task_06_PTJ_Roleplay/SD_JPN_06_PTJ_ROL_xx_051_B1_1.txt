 Uh. I, I think ARUBAITO   is not uh bad for me uh in my uh study because it is, uh, eh, if I don't   ARUBAITO  , it is no effect with my study, so I don't study. Uh. Uh. It is no reason because of not my study, ah, because I don't study. Uh. So, ARUBAITO   is not the reason for me uh to not, uh not study uh not study.
 Uh, I think the time I can spend in study is very uh small because my motivation is low in my uh this situation, this situation, oh, eh, in my time. So, if I don't uh, uh, so, eh, I think uh it is better choice to eh AURBAITO   and study in soci, social and eh not to read book and uh get a know, knowledge. Uh. We, I can --- I can get experience with social. It is very --- it is very usable   in --- when I, uh, when I graduate at the university and persuade in society.
 Uh, umm, in university, uh, there is a similar situation person. Uh. Only similar situation person is here, so uh in ARUBAITO   uh there is uh so many uh backgrounds is here. So, in society, uh, yeah, in university, there is all educated people, and they are very clever and they are very talkatable   but in society, uh, there is not so people and they are all of people is not graduates the university and high school. So, we can get eh a lot more practical uh knowledge with uh touch with uh people in AURBAITO  .
