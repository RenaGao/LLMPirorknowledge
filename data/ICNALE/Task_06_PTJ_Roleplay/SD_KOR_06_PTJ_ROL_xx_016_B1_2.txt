Yeah.  Uh, okay, so ---  uh, I think doing part-time job - to working in a part-time job with doing study together is not bad for me because, uh, it's not only causing a bad effect, I think for, like, uh my personal type is I will - I always want to set a goal and I - I - I always want to reach it and this - my goal of this semester is to achieve a - to learn a Spanish class.
To learn a Spanish.
Okay.  Um, mm, I think if - if you, uh - do I have to very strict or do I have to be persuasive---
Uh, I would - I would like to say that if you, uh, keep forcing me to stop working, it's - to work with studying together is my, uh, right and I - of course, I have a duty to finish my study successfully, to leave my study successfully but I think to finish my study successfully is, uh, I need, uh, motivation, so---
Well, umm, I would say I want to use my - I want to always use my time very efficiently so I - of course, I'm focusing on study on the time that I have to study, but the rest of the time I wanna use my time more valuably.
Well, yeah for me yes, because I can also get a money from working it which means I can live my, uh, make my life more, uh, high quality outside, yeah.
Yes please.
