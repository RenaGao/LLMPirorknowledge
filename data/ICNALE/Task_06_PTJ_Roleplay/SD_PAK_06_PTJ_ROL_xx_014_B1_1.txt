Um, sir, please allow me to continue my part-time job because, um, economy or my expenditure doesn't allow me to, uh, continue my studies, so if there is, uh, no part-time job, it is difficult for me to continue my studies.
Yes if you give me some, uh, time to understand the - the methodology of my studies, then - but if I left them my job, so there is no survival.
Yes, it is difficult, but I'll try, uh, my best, um, to give you my assignment on, um---
But I don't because, uh, my, uh, uh, expenditure doesn't, um, allow me to quit, but I'll give you assurance that I'll complete my assignment on time and if I - I cannot be able to do, so - then you can, um---
No.  I don't want to take any loan because I have to return that loan with 17%, um---
With 17%...
Yes I can, but that money which you lend, that is a burden, uh, I feel that is a burden on me and that burden may harm my education as well.
Yes, exactly.
Yes, you are right, but if I quit my job right now, then there is no chance to continue my studies.  If - may - maybe I can, um, enter into another semester if I have a job.  If I have no job, then I may leave from first---
---or second semester.
