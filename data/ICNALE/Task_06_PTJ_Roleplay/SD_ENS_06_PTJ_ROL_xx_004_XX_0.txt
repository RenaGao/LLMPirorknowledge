So at the moment, my parents are really, really poor and I need to help them with the living costs, so if possible, I would like to carry on working for my part-time job.
Yes, I am.
Yes.
Student's role is to study.
I will continue to study and I will work at the same time.  I think I can manage my time enough that I can do both.
I am not a worker, but it's important to help support my family.
Yes true, but if my family cannot support themselves, till - till then, I believe our family will fall apart.
Yes, and that's why I believe I will work hard enough to do both, my education and my part-time job.
I believe I can manage my time well enough to - to not allow that to happen.
Okay, then we can talk where I am failing and then I can work on that and we can improve  .
Yeah, well, unfortunately I have decided I want to carry on my part-time job and I will make sure to improve my grades.
