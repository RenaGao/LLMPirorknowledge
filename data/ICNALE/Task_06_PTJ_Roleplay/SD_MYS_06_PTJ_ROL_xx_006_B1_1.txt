Because I need money in order to pay for my tuition fees and so many things like the research or something.
Yes, probably.
Maybe to me other kind of - I - to do another kind of job or online it is difficult and I do not have, ah, good skill in order to work there and the only work that I manage to do is doing part-time job.
I'll try to manage myself, manage my time well, I'll try to manage my time well, sir.
