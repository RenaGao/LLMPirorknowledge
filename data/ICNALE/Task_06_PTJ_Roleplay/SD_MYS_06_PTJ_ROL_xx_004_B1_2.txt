Ah, all right.  So, for that can - I'll think I'll talk with my, hmm, boss for that to cut my working hours so that I can continue working more in the lab instead of working.
Ah, yes, I can because so far my - my results has been quite okay.  So, I - I'm confident that I can juggle two things for now.
Ah-hmm, well because, ah-hmm, I need some pocket money for myself because, ah-hmm, I need for myself.
