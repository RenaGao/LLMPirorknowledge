Good morning teacher.
Uh, because I want to find, uh, experience and want to get money.
Uh, I can separate my work and - and - work and study time.
Uh, I think - uh, about study, I will study hard in the room and if I can't understand in the room, I will read immediately after the class done - the class is done.
I think it's enough.
Uh, I think I can because I can separate, but if the time - uh, the project time is - is there about - uh, the work - work time, I think maybe I will take a vacation for, uh, some bit and come to work about my project.
Yes, I can.
Uh, because - uh, my - my employee - uh, employers is - is kind and I think she can allow me to work about study work.
Yes.
Okay.
Thank you.
