Um, I think the part-time job would not affect my study and research, uh, because I think, um, I can balance my time between, uh, my schoolwork and the part-time job.
Uh, I will, uh - because we had the timetable and I can, uh, use the rest of the time to do my part-time job and it is not affect my learning.
Yes.  Because the part-time job is not really use my lot of time.  I also had some leisure time or some, uh - have leisure time to study, maybe doing, uh, maybe when the weekdays, when I am not having a part-time and I can, uh, reading or studying my homeworks or assignments in doing that weekend or whatever, yes.
