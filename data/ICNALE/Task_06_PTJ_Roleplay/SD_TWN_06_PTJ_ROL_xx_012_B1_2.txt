Okay.  Um,  , um, my father's smartphone is broken and her birth - and his birthday is coming.  So, I really want to buy a new smartphone to my father.  So, I need part-time join   to earn some money.
Um,   but - um, but working part-time can - I can learn some social experience.  I think it is also important.
Um,   um,  .  Um, that I think it is different in school and in workplace.
Um,   I think people in school will be more friendly.  But when you are working, um, if you do something wrong and you may be fired.
Um, I will try to, uh - I will try do better.  I will try to, um, increase my grade to where I am - I am before and yeah.
