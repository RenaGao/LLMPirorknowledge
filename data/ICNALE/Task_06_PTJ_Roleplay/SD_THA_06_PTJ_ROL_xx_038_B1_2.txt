Because I - it's my life.  I want to earn some monies.  I think my, uh, some monies from my family is not enough for me to live my life.
I know, but I think the - if I can earn monies since I was in my - in university, it can built my - uh, it can pay for way for me to be a good worker in - in the future.  Yeah, and I think I can divide the times.  I can spare time to read a book and spare time to - give for my family, spare time for do other things.  I think in university life, there is many - many activity you need to do before you go to work in the future.
But for me I - I can endure it.  I can endure it.
I can - I can divide the time for study and divide the time for my part-time job.  The name is part-time job so it's not included all my time of - of the day.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.
It's very clear.
Okay, I--- 
Okay.  I accept it.
