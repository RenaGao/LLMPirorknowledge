Hello professor.  
I - I came here to talk about my part-time job.  I heard that you wanted to quit my job.
Oh, okay.  Um, um, I'm sorry that I was absent XXX  notice.  And - and I - I can assure you that it won't happen again.  I have arranged the time with my job and I'm not going to change it any more.  
I was really urgent last week.
Um, well, in this semester, I couldn't get - I'm not getting, you know, allowance from my parents, so I really have to work to go my money like to for transportation and for food and books.  
And so I have - I have to buy like really quickly, so that's why I have to work last week coming to class, I have arranged the time so now I don't have XXX .  
Um, I'm working 3 days a week.
Yeah.
Mmm, well, for in average about 5 or 4 hours.
Yeah.
Yes.  
Yes, but I think I can handle it.  
Yes.  
Yeah.
Well, actually, for the second - second XXX  couldn't come.  
Well, well, I would see if I could reduce it but I can't really predict because during the semester I still need money to live, and - and yeah, I have to work for that.  I have to buy books for classes and that requires money. 
Yeah.
Yeah.  But XXX  at the end of the semester.  
And I have to XXX  the semesters.  I mean, the XXX .
But I have other things to pay for.
Yeah.
Yes.
But I felt that the campus XXX  already.

I don't think I can apply for that.  
Yes, but I - I would really love to work on the campus.  But I told that there were no---
A week, yeah.
