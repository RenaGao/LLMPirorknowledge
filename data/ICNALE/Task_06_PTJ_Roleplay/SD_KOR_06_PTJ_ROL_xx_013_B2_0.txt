Uh, well, I'm also into my study, I really want to get a great score or after that, I want to get a great job but when it comes to graduation or before graduating, there is no chance for me to have a real social experience.  When it comes to part-time job, I have to serve my bosses and customers.  Through that case, I can learn how we make a service or how we treat people with a meaningful attitude so that would really help me when I get a job in the future.
But I am really into my study that's why I'm learning so many languages and of course all the business studies, so I'm concentrating on it and I need to earn money because, you know like, when it comes to young people hanging out, they really need money.  There is no allowance for me so I need to get money for what I want.
Well, I'm having a scholarship in my tuition fees so it's half divided so for me, there is - there is a little chance for me to get scholarship so it's better for me to have a part-time job. 
I don't want to be a burden for my parents.
