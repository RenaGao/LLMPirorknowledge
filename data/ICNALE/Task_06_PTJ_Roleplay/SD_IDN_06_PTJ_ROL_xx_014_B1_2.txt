My professor.
Ah I have to talk with you about my part-time job.
Ah a few - a few weeks ago you - you asked me to quit my job, but I can't do that.
No, no, not that - that - that is not true.  My - my GPA is dropped because not my part-time job but it's because my hobby.  So, I can guarantee you if I still working   and ah I will make it better for my GPA.
Okay, my part-time job is I am being - being a shopkeeper in the laptop shop.  So, so, it's not - not taking a lot of time for me as the shopkeeper.  So, I can - I can still study for my college.
Okay.  My part-time job we have - I have some partner.  So, I think if I have to go to the college I can change my schedule being a shopkeeper.  So, it's okay for me if I - I still doing   my part-time job.
Ah, shopkeeper is - I think yeah it's - it's - it's not hard - hard work that need hard work because you - you just wait, the customer come and you just uh, uh, explain the product so I - I think it's I can get a lot of benefit become a shopkeeper.  I can interact with people, I can persuade the people.  So, it's - I have many benefit it's being a shopkeeper.
I need to improve myself especially I have to know how people are thinking, how to persuade people.  So it's - it's going to be my benefit in the future I think.
No, no, I think not.
Maybe I later taking the training course but for now I want to still work as a part-time job in this shop.
Okay, my professor, I will come next week.  
---next week. Thank you.
