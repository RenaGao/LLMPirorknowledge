Hello madam.
You - you - you - you said me to stop - you told me to stop working immediately but I have to continue to work part-time.
I know but I determined I that - that I never give any help from my parents.  
But my wallet is - is empty, so I don't have money.  I don't have enough money to it, mm.
But right now I don't have enough money, so I am struggling. 
I - I don't want to give any help from my parents.  
In - in the future, I - I am going to live alone.
