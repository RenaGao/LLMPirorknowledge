Uh - okay, I don't - uh, I don't think that a part-time job will actually affect my, uh, study and research.  To be quite honest, I think part-time job actually provide the - the - uh, work experience we needed in our CVs.  And to be quite honest, it add ons to our study because during study we learn about theories and, uh, the words on - on the books and we are not applying it.  And I think that part-time job really adds on to this experience and as to enhance my future job, uh, or, uh, competiveness in the job market.  So, I think it is important for me to work, uh, part-time.  And what I do is that I make sure that it won't affect my study and research because I actually have a timetable setted up for, uh, my time management.  And I think if I can manage my time well, it - it wouldn't influence or change anything on my study.  I am still getting good results on my academics, and I cannot, um, gain experience at the same time, so I don't see the really the negative influence on my study and on research.
Yes.  Uh, uh, I have - I do have - people normally do their, uh, mana - uh, time management and the timetable for a week time in advance, whereas I do my timetable for a month.  So, actually from the beginning of the month I - I know clearly what I need to do at what point of the day, uh, what should I be doing, uh, let's say after studies or after work.  So, I think that really just, um, helps my time management as to compared to why some other people may not be as efficient, um, in their times.
