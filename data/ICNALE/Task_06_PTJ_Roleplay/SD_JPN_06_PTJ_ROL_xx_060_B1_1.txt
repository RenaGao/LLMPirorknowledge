 Uh. Umm. My parents give my umm give me money, but also I have many brothers and sisters, so I don't receive many money to live.
 Uh. There is uh---  
 But if I give --- no --- if I receive money from government, like scholarship, I need to return, so I don't know, I am not sure if I can return that money.
 Yeah, I think so, but the money is really important and I don't know if I can receive money soon if I use the scholarship, any money now, so I have to do a part-time job now.
 Umm. Thank you.
