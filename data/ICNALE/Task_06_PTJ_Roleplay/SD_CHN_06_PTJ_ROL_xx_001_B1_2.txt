Okay.  Um, I think, um, this part-time job is very useful for me.  It's not just as money.  Of course money is very important.
But I think the part-time job improve my, uh, Japanese ability.
Yes, of course I can improve my Japanese in school but, uh, uh, part-time job is not like school.  Uh, it's a society environment.
Means people will not think you are student.  They think you as a staff and in that situation, you can be more, um, stronger - your heart will be more stronger.
Yes.  Uh, study is most important thing in college.
But I really need that job because, uh, I don't have enough money for my, uh, life, for my everyday's life.
Mm, uh, I didn't borrow any money but, uh, early or later I have to give that back - money back and I am now do the part-time job and I don't need to borrow that money.
