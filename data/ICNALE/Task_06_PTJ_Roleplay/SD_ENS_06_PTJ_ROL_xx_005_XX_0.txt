Okay, so first, I just want to say thank you for meeting with me.
The issue about me doing a part-time job, I understand that you want me to focus more on my studies and my research.
Which I understand is important, uhm, but without this part-time job, I - it's hard for me to support myself. So uhm, you know, if I give up this part-time job then everything else, you know, aside from the research is going to be more difficult for me.
Growing pain?
I suppose but, you know, if things aren't stable at home, I think it's going to be hard for me to focus on my studies.
To learn.
Well, I'm a student and I'm also---  
Well I don't have enough money to support myself if I don't have the part-time job.
Uh yes, but - uhm - you know, if I can do something to make myself feel more comfortable, I think I would be better at my studies.
Okay, well, you said that you saw a potential in me?
Okay. Is it possible for the school to give me a scholarship to support me?
Okay, do you know of any scholarships I could apply for?
Oh really, well I guess I have research to do then.
