Uh, I am sorry that you - uh, I am very thankful to that you ask me about, uh, this that you are concerned about me that I have to do this job because there are some reasons for, uh - for paying me for this college.  So that I have to do this job.
Uh, I know that the part-time jab - job is much longer than, uh, I focus upon my studies.  I rather make it, uh, much shorter that it doesn't influence on my studies or affecting my studies.
I have, uh, uh - I have considered this point that I didn't work on my assignments and my projects on time, but I have make a plan about this that I am, uh, make my job much shorter span - for much shorter spans to give much time to my studies so that I can do this.
If I quit my job then there is, uh, no hope for getting me a degree that I wouldn't be able to pay to college to get my degree.
I think that borrowing money is something like, uh, you are killing yourself.
Because borrowing money is something burden upon you and people don't want to live under burden.  That's why I sort out some plans that I make a job much shorter and do some other job which is - which pay me more than this and so that I can focus upon my studies.
I have tried college scholarship that they should give me a scholarship so that I can, uh, continue my studies but if there is no scholarship then I have to do this job to take my degree to give thesis.
