Okay.  I think I should keep my part-time job because it funds my education.  Without it, I wouldn't be able to enroll into this college.
I think I should really balance the two, not only focusing on the part-time job but also on my research because while I am not performing well at my research, I am also spending money on it.  So the more I keep it going on and on like in progress projects like that, where it stucks over my priorities and my part-time job, I also lose money for paying those courses.  So I think I should balance the two.  I should take my part-time job and while having a rest or a brief period of my part-time job, I should also take care of my research.
I think it should be the part-time job, because it funds my education and yeah, without it, I won't be able to study too.
Thank you.
