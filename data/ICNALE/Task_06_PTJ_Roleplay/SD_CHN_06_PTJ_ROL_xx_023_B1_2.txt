Uh, I - I had - uh, I worked, uh, part-time job when I came to Japan, uh, for only 1 month.
What did you do?  Uh, to - I did not know the English is called XXX  in the supermarket to - to get the - to get the things, uh, in - in front of the shelf - shelf.
Yes.
I think it is easy for me because at that time, I'm not very skillful in Japanese, so I'm not - I was not very confident to speak, so I cannot do the XXX .  So, I chose to just put some - put the things - all the things.
Um, only in school - only in college.
Uh, as I just said, I like face-to-face, so I will chose the tutor.
Umm, if I choose to do it, I have to get used to it.  I will not choose it.  I will not.
It's up to - it's up to your heart.  If you really want to focus on your study, I don't think you should, uh, do the part-time job.  Uh, you want to - and you want not only to study but also get some experience - get some social experience, you - you can choose to do it.
Uh, to communication---
---with others.
In campus, we usually talk - talk with students.  Students, they do not have enough experience - social experience, but in - but if you do the part-time job, you can, uh, meet some people from the society.  It is, uh, very useful for you to - uh, for you to get the experience after you get into the society.
