I - I hear that you - you give me some advice to stopping my part-time job.
But my professor, for this - for this time, I - I join that - I am taking for my work part-time - my part-time job, it's because I want to have another experience than from this - this school only.  Because I working at the center research of economic in this city, so based on my focus is on the microbiology and biochemistry so for that job I also can learn about the economy.  So I please to you to um continuing my part-time job on - part-time job on that place.
Okay, but in my another - my another argument is because I do have a lot of friends on that - on my working place, so it's is very help me to knowing each other and also for the - from that part-time job I got some money so I can have uh much saving for my graduation - for my future graduation because I am - I want to continue in master degree so I should have a lot of saving.
But um I promise that in next semester I can improve my grades because in the next semester there is some major which - which relate - relating to the economic situation.
So, it really - in my opinion it can really improve my - my grade because I have to - I have - I have know about economic.
Yes, of course.  My part-time job is do - um, doing some review for the - for the roles and policy in economic, especially for the international conflict.
No, because I am working on my working place after I finish my course in - in the college.
Okay.  Thank you sir.
