Okay.  Okay, sir, here is the thing.  So, you know, the bad grades recently I got this semester.  
Yeah, it is because I am working part-time in a small company near here because you know my dad - my dad died a year ago and my mother has to work and now she is sick and I have two sisters that I must help in their school.  So, I need to work sir.  You know I - I actually really also concerned about my bad grades this semester but you know I have to do these two jobs, that's one studying and one is living my family.  So, I hope you really understand me and you can help me what should I do to resolve these two problem   together.
Yeah actually I don't really like working this part-time job in this caf�� because, you know, I don't really have a passion in it. But, you know, this is what I have to do, this is what - this is how I get money for my family, for me.  Well the condition is my mother is sick now.  So, you know, if you - if you can help me with the other suggestion of work that is easier and I can also cope with my academic job, so I will really appreciate help from you sir.
Yeah, actually my part-time job in the - in the caf�� is actually I have to stand by there from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., so this is the work hour.  And I - actually while I - while I there I can do nothing else except I'm working there I can't study, I can't work any assignment or anything.  So, yeah I know I know it's - it's really, really conflicting with my schedule in the academic schedule.  But yeah it's again, actually I am afraid I won't find any better job than this if I resign from this caf��.  So, if you have any suggestion or any - any help for me I will really appreciate it.
Okay.
I will - I really appreciate your help sir.  Thank you very much.
