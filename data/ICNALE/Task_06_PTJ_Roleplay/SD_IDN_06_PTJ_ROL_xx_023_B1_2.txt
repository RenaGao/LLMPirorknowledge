Uh-huh, sir.
So depend on my student - uh sorry, my part-time job---
---that may be distracting me to do in as a scholar---
---uh I just want to give you one - uh, a few reason that uh you have - I have to prove it that uh the part-time job is important for me because---
---because the part-time jobs, it makes me uh good and upgrade my knowledgment   and practicing what I already have in the - from the college some theory that maybe like a marketing or promotion, it help me so much practicing in my part-time job.
So the both of the student life and my part-time job is uh one of the - I have to pretend this one.
Not direct - uh not related exactly but one of the part-time jobs uh is like promoting something and handle the customer, just like make me brave to handle - to face uh another person and like promoting something.  And it just like make me uh upgrade my knowledge from theory.
Hmm
Okay.
Uh because of the part-time jobs, I get lot of things, a lot of experience that relates with some theories that I already have.  So uh maybe I have to prove it a few months later about upgrading my uh - like uh exam - uh exam, also like a value that you don't - you don't think that I can pass it.
Uh usually the classes start in the morning after - in the morning and then afternoon, and my part-time jobs is start from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  And in the weekend there is a day off for me so I can use that day for uh repeat my the theory - the theory and also like - uh like make homework from study.
Uh-huh
Yeah, for now maybe I am better for just like some - some subject or some yes, but I guess I can handle it sir, because the part job is important for me and also in the study life maybe I want to prove that I can balance both of them.
Uh-huh
Hmm
Okay.
Thank you.
