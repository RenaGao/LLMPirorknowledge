Um, I think do part-time job and do the student work I can learn how to manage my time.
I think it's important thing to all the people no matter you are a student or you are professor.
Yes.  And---
I think I am doing well on my study.
Actually, I am satisfied with how I am right now.
If you're not satisfied, I - I am sorry about that.  But I think it's important for me to learn how to manage my time, and sometimes in a school I can't learn everything.  And when I am doing part-time job, I can learn something that the - I feel I can't learn from the school.  I think it's important. 
Like, um, speak to - how to speak to my superior or the teamwork.  Yeah, we have to work in - in a school, but I think it's not enough.
I think it's too late.  I have to - before I graduating I think I have to, um, learn more skills and to prepare to get a job after I graduate.  So, I think in college I have to learn more skills.
Yes.
It's not because of the money.
Yes.
Yes.
