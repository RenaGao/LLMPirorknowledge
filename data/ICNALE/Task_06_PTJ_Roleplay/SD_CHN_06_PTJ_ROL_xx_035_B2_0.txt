Okay, uh, so, uh, Ms. - Ms. Lee, I would like to see   that I am enjoying my part-time job and I would like to say some reasons to, you know, uh, let you, you know, give me some time to do my part-time job.  The first reason is because as a graduate who start - who study economics and, uh, personally I - I - I tried to do lots of, you know, research part-time job like data ana - uh, data analyze or, you know, data researching, and I don't think this kind of part-time job is waste of time.  Uh, I do consider those part-time - those jobs can help me, you know, uh, protects or improving my data collecting skills.  Uh, for second reason, I do have to - I have to admit that those job can earn some money for me and it helps me to improve my, you know, uh, life qualities a lot.  And the second - the third reason is I do enjoying those kind of part-time job.  I am not, you know, having a bad experience or feel tired.  I do enjoying and I do, uh, think that those jobs can help me find more - uh, not more but more, mm, quality or - or, uh, can help me get more experience, uh, in my third year in graduate.  I mean it can - it just can help me to get a better job.
Uh, as you can see that I do a lot of part-time job in - in - in - in, uh, afternoon, and normally I notice that afternoon we - I - I do have a bad - uh, bad efficiencies when I start.  So, um, I decided to do a lot of part-time jobs in afternoon.  And I do think if you don't have a great efficiency, uh, you can just try a lot of different things to im - improve your efficiencies.
