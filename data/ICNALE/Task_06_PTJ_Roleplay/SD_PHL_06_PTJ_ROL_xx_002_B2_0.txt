So uh, uh, good afternoon ma'am.   
So concerning about uh, your advice to drop my part-time job---
Uh.
I would like to ask uh, if you would allow me to continue with my job because the people in the workplace help me grow and they also help me in doing my research.  So apart from that, I enjoy the environment even doing the research.
Well, I mean, for now ma'am professional work is my objective and I think research work comes after that.
But ma'am I didn't have any feedbacks from the past, so now that you have given me that I might try as well improve first myself but I won't be giving up my part-time job.
