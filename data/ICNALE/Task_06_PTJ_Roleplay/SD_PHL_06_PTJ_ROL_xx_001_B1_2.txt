So ma'am, I am working part-time because this is the only thing that I am able to do to be able to continue my research studies and my studies in particular because we are not that well off.
But ma'am, I think that when I stop this, I won't be able to go to school anymore because I won't be able to continue to uh, pay for my tuition and pay for my fees as a student.
Yes, I know that.
Ma'am, uh, please give me one more - another chance to be able to prove myself that I am ready that I am - that I am the promising student that you see me as I am, and I hope that I will be able to continue working as a part-time with the part-time job while doing my research because I know that I am capable of doing this.
