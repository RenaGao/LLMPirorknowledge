I think - I - I see I can - I can earn some - earn - earn very important experience when I work part-time.  So, I don't think so - I don't think that I will - I will - it will negatively influence my work - uh, study - study and research.  So, I think I should work - work - actually I can - I think I can work and study together.
I don't think grade - grade - grade - grade represent, eh, eh, everything.  I think the experience is important too.
My classmate and my teacher won't do the real thing to me.  We have the friendship, so I think - I think go to - go to the - go to work have - will be the true thing after I graduate.
It is true.
Uh, I think - I think experience is important too, so I - the money is the - is not the most important thing.  The money is not important thing.  The experience is important too.
