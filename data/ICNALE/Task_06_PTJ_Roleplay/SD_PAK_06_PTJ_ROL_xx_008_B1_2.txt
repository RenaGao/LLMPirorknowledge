But sir, I, uh, do not have another choice.  I need to meet my expenses.
Uh, I can work both simultaneously.
I - I can reduce the time of my part-time job but I cannot completely quit it because I need to, uh, earn some money in order to meet my expenses.
Because I'm unable to finance my education otherwise.
Definitely, I will have to work.
Because I'm, uh, financially weak.
Uh, not that I know of but I can try.
Uh, yes, that's a case but, uh, if I don't get the loan, I will have to carry my job on.
Yes I did.
So, I didn't get the loan.
What I - what I can do to meet my priority is that I can take some time off from my part-time job in order to do my work.
Quitting is not an option.  I will definitely have to return to my work after I finish my work here in the university.
