So why - why is that you're asking me to go over and say to drop working part time?
I understand.  But again I am an adult.  It's my choices of whatever I do with my free time and I also need to work because I have to pay my rent.
Well, if I apply for loans I am not sure if I will be able to pay them back and also for scholarships, those aren't exactly guaranteed and I have to think about how to support myself right now.  So---
Well, I understand, but again even though my grades are going down I have to do what I can to support myself.
Well, if you have any other options that I can work with right now I'd like - I'd be happy to hear it.  But at the moment I have to take care of myself right now.  So---
I have pursued them but I haven't really got into any yet but if I do end up getting a scholarship then I will consider dropping my part-time job.
I do.
I understand but again it's my choice that I - it's my choice that I work my part-time job.
I understand but again it's my choice.
