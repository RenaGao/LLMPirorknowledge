  I like my part-time job because I can face many different kind of people when I - when I am working and I am selling some electronic devices such as camera or computer.  And I am study in, eh, school of communication and we - in our program we need to use camera for taking picture or using some recorder for record the sound.  And in my job I can try this kind of devices, and it is a good chance for me to practice my skills and I can also earn some experience for how to - for talking with others.  That's why I would like to keep doing my job and I can balance my time in studying and working.
Yes.
Hmm, in a week I - I am not go to school every day.  I have day off and I just use, eh, part of my holiday to go to work and in my school I will work - I will study harder.
I know.  This a - it is a part-time job I can decide what - when I need to go work if in the - in the end of my semester I need to submit some project and prepare my exam I will reduce some - reduce my time for work and focus on study, first.
