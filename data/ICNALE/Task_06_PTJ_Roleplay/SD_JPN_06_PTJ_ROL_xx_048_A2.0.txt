 Umm. Hmm. Uh. Now I am work   at a cram school and I teach English and Japanese to the high school student   and junior high school students.
 Uh. It is very good experience for me to teach uh teach young people.
 Uh. Uh. In the university, I can --- maybe I can study uh some teacher uh I can join classes but there --- there is uh up there I only do listening to their speak, uh, their class, so I can only do the input of some know --- knowledge but in the cram school, I can output my knowledge to them, so the both of the experience is uh really good. Hmm. Uh. Most of the experience developed me to umm uh really skillful man.  
 Umm. Yeah. It is true that but umm maybe I --- I will not uh work at the cram school uh in my life uh forever uh, uh when I uh when I say uh when I become the 24, umm, graduate this school, I will work at another company or another uh some companies, so um-hmm teaching some --- teaching young people is uh also uh limited experience for me, uh, I can that experience, uh, I can experience those things uh only in this time, so I want to do.
 One more time, please.
 Uh.
 Relationship. Uh. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Uh.
 Umm. As I talk  , I teach English and uh Japanese.
 Japanese is a very difficult uh subject because the content is very uh huge --- huge --- huge, uh, so umm, uh, I listen to many story, story and I got --- I get many knowledge in this university and so talking that in the ARUBAITO   uh I can uh make my knowledge deeply.
