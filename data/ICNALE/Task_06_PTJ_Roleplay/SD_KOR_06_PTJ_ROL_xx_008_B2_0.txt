Uh, don't like that.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.  I understand what you are concerning about but my - I think studying in university is important, but the part-time job means a lot to me, because it's my first job and I met a lot of people that depends on me.

I can reduce the working time, but I can't reduce that much.  Uh, okay, I will try to reduce the working time, but I will gradually - gradually reduce the time working.
