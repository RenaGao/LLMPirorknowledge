Hello, teacher.
Um, I'm your student.
And I - I heard you - you think the part time job is neg - neg -negative - negatively influence---
---my study and---
---research.
But I think - but I want to - I want to do the - continue the part time job.
Because I think, uh, I can learn more thing - I can learn more things than - in it than in class.
And I will have more experience about the - about - about the society---
---than in class.
This course we don't have too many - too many classes.
So, I have a plenty of time to do part time job and in - and awake.  And I will do and it will take accounts - account for about 2 hours in a day.
So, I think I can balance it well.
Okay.  Thank you.
