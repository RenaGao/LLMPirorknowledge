I think I study all day which is - and which makes me feel bored or exhausted.
I can't do the other type of jobs that make the - make the - make the date interesting.
So, I think I do a part-time job, which can make me feel good to restart the study and the research.
I think I can keep this part-time job but I reduce the - the - the time I do this job---
---so that I can do the job and study, simultaneously.
Uh, in school club I face a lot of people but it's probably just students.
But I can - I can face more different type of people such as, uh, boss or just, uh, uh - boss or lawyers or teachers such as many kinds of different people.
But in school club I can only just face - face students or maybe just professors.
So I can face more people when I do a part-time job.
Uh, I think the job experience is - is important to my future life so--- 
I need to accumulate more society experience---
---in order not to - or in order to get used the society after I graduate from the university.
Um, many people - after graduation, many people will feel strange because the work is probably not related to what they just learn.
They need to - um, get used to the - this job that the boss needs he or - him or her to do.
So, we can - we need to trained us to get used to something easily---
---to cater to the future job.
