Okay.  I'm good.  So, um, I need to continue to do the part-time because the money is important to me, I think having a life is important outside of study.
But a full-time student just mean the requirement for the workload and if I can handle my workload with my part-time in place then I don't think part-time will become a matter.
Uh, I believe that part-time is flexible so, uh, I will see my progress with the presentation and the test and if I am falling behind then I would do part-time less or even don't do it for like a - a week or two or something.  But if I - I think if my progress is good like study I had and I complete my project before the deadline, a couple day before deadline and I think, uh, the part-time job will not affect my performance on this.
Uh, I think my progress is pretty good, so, uh, I started studying like two weeks before the exam and the presentation is going pretty well since I work good with, uh, XXX   so I think it's good.
