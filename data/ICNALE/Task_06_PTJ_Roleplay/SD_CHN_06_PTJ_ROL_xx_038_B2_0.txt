Uh, okay.    Uh, um, uh, I - I want to continue to do this part-time job because first I think I can gain a lot from this, uh, part-time job.  Uh, as you know I am - uh, I am a student who majored in English and this part-time job can provide me with an opportunity to sharp my - uh, to sharpen my speaking skills.  So, I think this part-time job actually, uh, benefit me a lot.  So, I want to continue this job no matter what and second of all, I don't think this part-time job will, uh, inactively - uh, inactively - uh, inactively - inactively influence my study.  And I would try my best to balance, uh, work and study and I think this is, uh, really good for me in my future because in the future I need to learn how to balance - uh, balance my work - uh, balance my work with, uh, for example, my family or something else.  So, I think this part-time job can, uh, give me an opportunity to learn how to balance everything in my life in advance so that I can deal with the - uh, the situation in the future, yeah.
Uh, first, I can increase the time that has - uh, that I spend on study.
Because you know when I have to do my part-time job and I have to study, uh, I really don't have much time left but even - uh, even well at that time I, uh - I don't spend, uh the time all on my study.  So, I think that's the main cause, uh, for the, uh, any possible, uh, bad outcomes that, uh, in my study.  Uh, but, uh, I can increase this, uh, time and when I am at work I can, uh - I can use some, uh - some really, uh, flexible time to try to study other things, yeah.
Okay.
