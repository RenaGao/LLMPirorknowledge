Uh, I think that this place is nearer to my educational institute, so it makes it easy for me to work here and then also keep, cope up with my, the burden of study as well.
No, I think I can do it because I have always worked, uh, side by side with my studies.  So, I think I will.
Uh, I - I understand the point you are making but I am - I am working hard enough and I think I hope that I would be able to, you know, submit my thesis on time. 
Uh, I think the life is always going to be like this, so there is no easy way out.
Uh, I do have some but I think that it's a big mistake to borrow money from other people. 
Because it just keeps hanging over you like a burden that you---
Who knows what's going to happen in the future, so---
Well, I always think that it is better to work on your own.  That's why I am willing to take this burden on me.
