Uh, sir.
May I know the reason why I need to stop working in, at this restaurant?
Oh yeah.  But, um, when I work in here, I don't think that my work is disturbing my study at all.  I can manage my time properly and very well. But I can see that you are busy and you are not focusing in class.
Not at all, sir.  I know that I'm trying to do my revision, complete my assignment, yeah, since that, you see, you see me like a bit busy but I have a good rest at home.
Uh, because I want to save my money by working at here because I have a plan.  I want to travel to, very soon.  Whenever I, maybe I, after I graduate.
