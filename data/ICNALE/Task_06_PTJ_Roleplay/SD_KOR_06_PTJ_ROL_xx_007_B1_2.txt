Uh, but sir, I need this job as I didn't get any scholarship last semester.  So, I can't afford my, uh, tuition fee, so I need this job.
Mm-hmm, twice a week.
Mmm, 5 hours maybe.
I'm a student.
Right.
Uh, study.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no, I'm good.  I - I am doing my best.
Uh, okay, I'll think about it.
I'll think about it.
Yes.
I'm sure.
Oh.
Yes.
No.
Thank you.
