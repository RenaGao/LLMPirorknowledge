Hi.  Umm, I need to - as you know, I work part-time, and  .
Yes.  But as you know, I - I support myself with this part-time job.  I actually enjoy doing it and my grade hasn't been slipping---
I see.  But I - I thank you but I feel like I have a really good work life balance as of now - as of now.  I think it would be kind of unfair if I were to quit this part-time job because this is my only source of living.  I - I need this job for myself.
I will look into that, but as of now while I apply for those, you know, options, I would really appreciate it if I can keep my part-time job for now.
School of course.
Well, as I mentioned, it's - it's actually a need for me to continue this part-time job.
It - it supports me.
Like, I don't get monetary help from - from my parents.  I am fully independent, and I really need a part-time job.
