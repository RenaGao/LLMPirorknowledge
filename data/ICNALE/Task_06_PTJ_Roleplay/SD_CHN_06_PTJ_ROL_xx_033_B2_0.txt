Uh, sorry teacher, I - um, I don't want to give up my part-time job.
Um, um, I think it have many advantages, so first I think, uh, it can dream my - dream my ability of many - from many, uh, aspects.  Um, that's you can let me know how to control my time, um, because there are too many things I need to do, so I have to try to balance the time between work and study.
So, I think I can do it, please leave me.
Um.
Uh, for this situation, I will choose to, uh, take class and gave up - give up that day's part-time job.  So, um, I know you - you may think I can't - um, because of my part-time job, I can't do well in my academic performance, so, um, I - I will correct myself and try to do it better.
Another one maybe, um, I can also earn some money and I can relieve the stress for my family.
