Hmm, I need to continue my part-time job, because I need this money.  I - I - I want to buy something, but my parents won't give me any money if I - because I don't do any job in my house.  They will do the housework and they say I don't have to do.  I just have to study.  But actually, I still need some money to fill my daily needs.  So, I have to work it by myself to get money, so I can maybe hangout with my friends, maybe buy some new shoes.  So, that's the only income that I can get so.
But I think instead of influencing my academic performance, it can also give me some special experience that can make me - maybe, they are useful in my future, maybe when I was applying for some new job, they can help me.  So, I think it is still the great experience for me.  I - I should just continue to do my part-time job.
Uhm, I think the most special one is you can learn how to deal with the weird guy coming in the night.  When you are the only one staying in the store and a drunk guy come in and wanted to do something that is not good, you have to stop him and you also have to protect yourself from hurt by this guy.  So, it is very special and it is also hard - hard experience that you can get.
