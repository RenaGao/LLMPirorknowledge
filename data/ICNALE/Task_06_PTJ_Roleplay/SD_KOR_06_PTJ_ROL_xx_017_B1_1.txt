Okay, yeah, actually, the study - studying is also important to me, because I am the student in especially college.  But also we - also relationship is very important in my age like - like 20.  I - I mean - I mean in 20s, we can make a lots of - a lots of relationship but - a lot of - many kinds of relationship, but if I - if I only study, I only can make - I only can make school relationship.  Actually, I don't like - I don't want that, because I'm - I'm prep - I'm preparing for social - social working.
But if - if I - if I mean the social, if I don't - if I don't have any experience and any other relationship, maybe I suffer something really bad.  But that part time job can make me more - more experienced and also more - more, uh, relationship, so.
Yeah.
Yeah, I agree - I agree with that.  But if you want, uh, yeah, if you think, uh, I'm - I'm losing - I'm losing the time for the studying, but I think I can make more time.  I mean---
I don't think so.  Just - just scholarship, actually just - just scholarship is good for student.  If I am always - always being student, but I have to graduate the school.  I have - I have to graduate the college, so and also you said to me - you said to me I'm going to sleep in the class, but please Professor, I - I haven't - I haven't slept in the cla - in the class, isn't it?
Hmm, yeah, I agree and I'm not yeah, but I have - I have - I - I have the con - I have the confidence for don't sleep in class and - and also I told - I told you, uh, uh, sorry - you said to me about I'm losing the time, but I don't think so.  It's - it have more time for my life.  So, you know, I think I don't - I'm not losing the time for the study. 
Thank you.
