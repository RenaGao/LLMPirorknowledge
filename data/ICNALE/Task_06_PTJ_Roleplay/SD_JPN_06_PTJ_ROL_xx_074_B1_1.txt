 Hello?
 So, Mr. Pro --- Professor, I want to continue my uh part-time job.
 Because uh my family --- uh, uh --- as you know, I use the scholarship and I --- so maybe my income is not so --- uh --- if the part-time job's income will lose --- lose maybe I can't live --- I can't --- maybe I can't buy the food or like that, so.
 Yes-yes-yes, uh, uh, maybe I have to return such a scholarship after I graduate from the grad university, so uh so if I borrow a lot and I used a --- a lot of money of scholarship, maybe I have to --- I will have to suffer to return the money so.  
 Yes, yes, yes, but in short term, I have to --- if --- if I can't uh maybe I can't learn by part-time job, umm maybe uh that --- that also umm that also will be the obstacle for the studying because uh for example, uh when --- huh-huh, uh, when I study about the --- uh when I study about or --- uh --- when I   studying, I have to care about the uh umm this month the money is good or huh-huh this month money is enough or to think about the such things and maybe that --- that will be --- that in the --- intent will be in my mind so I have to care umm even when I study about the some --- something.
 But for my case, it's not --- it's not the --- it's not enough.
 Because I have to pay the housekeeping money and---  
 Yes, but everyone is not so --- the same situation and I am not so rich like uh other students.
 Thank you very much.
