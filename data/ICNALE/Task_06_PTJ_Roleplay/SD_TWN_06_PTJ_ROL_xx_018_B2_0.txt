I know being a student is important for me to study hard right now.  But I think do a part-time job can make me learn more things that   I can learn from class like social skills.  And when I conflict the problem, how can I handle it immediately.
Yes, I can but I think when I do a part-time job, can know more about the social because in my club I only meet, like, most of my friends are the same age.  So, when I do my part-time job, I can meet some elderly people and face more different problems.
Hmm.  Well, maybe, I should learn how to arrange my time when I study and work at the same time.  So, I think doing this job won't, uh, have a great impact on my study.  If you want me to - want me to study harder and I will try my best.
Maybe, I can try from next semester.
Um, I think, uh, maybe I can study when I - when I work in the class.  And after class I can review it immediately and it helped me to remind what you teach in the class.
