Okay.  Uh, supervisor actually my job is about - is very similar to this - module is about the translation, I am now working in translation, some company so I work every mo - every moment I work is about - or every job I work is about translating things, translating law or translating some business policy.  So, it's actually very similar to your class so if I still getting into this job, I can have more experience and I can do a few things more easier.
Actually that job is just a part-time job.  I - I always go to work after the school and free time - free hours or some - in that free hours I can actually finish your homework already and so I can go to the work - I can go to work.
Actually, nowadays, people only use Skype or some - WhatsApp or some other software to communicate, really not go into library for the discussion, so it - it can - I can already finish the job when I have the computer and phone into my hand, so I don't need to go to school for the project.
Um, actually I - yes, as I say, I only go to the work after this - after school so every lesson I am still coming, so I'm still coming all the lessons so I can go to have the lecture or some presentation.
