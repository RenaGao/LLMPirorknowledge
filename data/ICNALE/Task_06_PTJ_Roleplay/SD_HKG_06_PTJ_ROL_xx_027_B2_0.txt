Okay.  Um, I - I think that, um, that the part-time job is very important to me because, um, firstly I think it can - uh, I can earn money from this and, um, I am - I don't want to use so much money, uh, that - that comes from my parents.  I don't want to spend their - their money that much.  So, I want to earn my own money, that's, um - and then I can do maybe like - uh, do things that I like by using my - my money but not theirs.  And then also I - I think I - I can learn something, um, from this part-time job because I - I work as a - as a tutor in a learning center.  And I can train up my, um - my speaking skills and also how to teach students English.  So, it's important maybe for my, um, future career.  So, I think, um, uh, um, that's - these are the reasons why I - I should keep doing this part-time job.
Um, I think so.  Um, but the job only like, uh, accommodate some of the time of my maybe like 3 hours a day so I will actually have, uh, other time for doing homework and also, um, revising and things taught by the lecturer.
Yes.
