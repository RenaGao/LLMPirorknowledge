Uh, good morning teacher.
I was told by my friend that you wanted to see me.
Uh, yes I am doing a part-time job at night as a waiter at a nearby restaurant.
Coping with my study?  I think I can because, uh, for me I, uh, at my restaurant of course is not that busy so from time to time there are space and time for me to just sit and study for a while.  So I can search for time to study doing to improve my learnings.
Uh, for me, I can pretty much manage my studies because, uh, at school I -- I usually didn't, uh, not focus at class because I -- I have friends and means that make me want to study more, so when I did not understand much so I can ask them since they are pretty much my housemate and roommates.  Plus, uh, I can learn much more experience when I am working.
Yeah, I can maintain good grades since I am still one of the students in the lead in the class right now, so I think I can manage my learnings and I can manage my grades, of course.
Okay, okay.
