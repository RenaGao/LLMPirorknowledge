Hi.  Uh, I - I have three reasons for continuing this part-time job.  First, um, - first, um, because I am - I arrived here in Japan for only 3 or 4 months, so I have to find some way to develop my Japanese skills, especially the speaking skills.  If I took - uh, take part in this part-time job, I can quickly gain the speaking skills.  And - and secondly I think, uh, doing a part-time job, um, I can - uh, uh, I can understand the Japanese culture or the living style in this country.  This can help me with my study.  And, uh, lastly, I think, uh, doing part-time job, basically we can - uh, I can gain, uh, some - uh, a little sum of money, uh, so this can get me a good mood in this country and I - uh, because I can - maybe I can buy something that I need, but I don't want to use my father or my mother's money.  Yes, that's all.
Uh, uh, for these, I - I think, uh, um, to start with - and, um, for - for the studying time is not enough, this I - I - I don't think so because, um, studying and relaxing are two important parts in student life I think. 
Uh, because in the job, I can - uh, I can make some other friends in different areas, for example, some workers or painters or sailors.  They have their different lives in the city, so I think, uh, talking with them, uh, is different from talking with the teachers or the students, classmates in the school.  So, uh, in this part-time job, I can gain a lot more, uh, to understand or study in this city.
