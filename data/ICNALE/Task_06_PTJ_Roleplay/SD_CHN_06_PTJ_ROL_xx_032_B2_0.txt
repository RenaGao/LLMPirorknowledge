Uh, Hello, Ms. Lee.
I am - I am right now doing a part-time job, so - uh, but I hear that you are not okay with that, so I come here to talk with you.
It is a part-time job to teach, uh, young students English.
But Ms. Lee, I have to say it's quite important for me to do this part-time job because, you know, recently my - uh, let's say I have some cash problem, so.
It's serious I have to say.
You know, I am adult now so I do not want to make extra pressure on my parents, and I think I can balance this two stuff, and I have to say, right, because, uh, recently my academic performance is not that good, uh, because it's my first time to do part-time job, but, uh, now I - I got, uh - uh, got a way to balance this two and I have confidence to do my academic things well next time.
