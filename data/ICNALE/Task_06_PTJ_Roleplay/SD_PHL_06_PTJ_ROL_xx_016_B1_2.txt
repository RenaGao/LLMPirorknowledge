  ah hello, Professor, I do understand that the job, the job is, the part-time job is affecting my school and my research.  But I really have to do this so that I may continue going to school, because if I stop, I may not be able to go to school and do my research because of financial problems that may arise.
I think a good way is to set my time and my and do my time management first before considering to leave the job since I really need the money.  So, I'll try managing my time between work and school.
I'll ask my, I'll ask my boss about the job if he could split the job to a shorter time and to a lower pay.  With that I get more time and I still get the money.  And I think it's, for me, it's the best way to tackle the problem.
Thank you.
