Okay.    Um, so in my stage of as a student, you may think students need to concentrate on studying and studying but these are just on the book.  The real life is, if you don't have experience the employers would not hire you.  Well, I am doing the part-time job now is actually going to equip me to be a better me.  And I would learn more from your workplace, you can coach me, you can teach me and you - what you can teach me is to know how to survive in the real world instead of following the books, instead of learning what the books can only tell.  And it is really different and I can manage my time pretty well and I - I have done it so far and you can see how I manage to, uh, study and go to your place and work and I hope you can, uh, allow me to stay here and work for you.
Yes.  And since we know quite a long time, I know you will be very flexible and you will spare me some days for, uh, my studying and I hope it won't affect your, um, operations and of your shop.  Uh, and I will use these few days to finish all my studies and come back to you.
