Um, I can use less time to - for playing or hangout with friend - friends and, yes.
Um, it won't because I have a part-time job now and I can do the part-time - go to - go for work when I am day off and other time I can, uh, like revising, uh, when I get out of class and I have - also have time to go for the exercise, running or, um, hiking, yes.
