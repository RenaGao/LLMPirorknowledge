So uh, ma'am, uhm, I was wondering uh, why you wouldn't allow me to continue my part-time job.
Uh, is that so?
Okay.  I understand.  But I think that having uh, a part-time job would be better for me because uh, it would - uh, I would gain more experience uh, and uh, as I am studying right now and working at the same time, it will also - uh, I will also gain a lot of uh, values and benefits to myself.
Is that so, uh, ma'am?  So uh, what if uh, we have a deal uh, if I put more uh, into my studying time, rather than my part-time, but um, you give me uh, sometime where uh, I can uh, work for a few hours but then I can exert more effort and more - uh more time in my research and my projects, would that be okay?
We did ma'am, but uh, as you can see, the company that I am working for part-time is very important to me.  And I believe that I am a very good - I am a very great asset to the company and uh, showing my effort to the company would be great.  But I am not saying that I should leave this - leave all my research behind, because I know it's important to the school.  So as much as possible, uh, I want to uh, put more effort in my - my research and my study.
Alright, thank you.
