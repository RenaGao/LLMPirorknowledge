Um, I have the job because I want to learn more Japanese.  Japanese is not in the, um, school, but, um, I will place XXX .  Um, so the job is not only for the money and I can have the more chance to such - to, uh, touch with different people.
Yes, but actually I will - I will not spend more time on part - part job.  When I - when I tired or when I don't want to study, I have a little time can to do the things that I want to talk - talk about people and - um, yes, I can touch with the people in the college, but it's not enough.  Um, in the job, I will see the more and, um, the - the - eh, the things about the - uh, ... about the XXX .
In the work, I can - I can see the attitude about the Japanese.  Um, the - actually is about the job and the setting, uh, about the country. 
I think I can make the balance.
