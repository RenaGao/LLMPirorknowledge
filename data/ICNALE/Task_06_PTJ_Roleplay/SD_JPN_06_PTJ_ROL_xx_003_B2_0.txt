 I want to keep doing part-time job, because, yeah, I --- yeah, I --- I know that it is --- it takes time --- my time to study.
 But if I have a lot of time, I --- it does makes me don't want to --- don't feel necessarily to study it, because I have a lot of time.
 But if I have a --- a short time, only short time, yeah, I have to do study, right, because I don't have any other time.
 So, I think for me, if I have lots of time, I don't study well, so.
 Yes, but only studying makes me --- makes me give --- have --- makes me have a small view, I think, and.
 Yes, but for me, if I have short time, I --- maybe I can know that what is the most important thing to study.
 And if I --- yes, I can --- maybe I can know the --- the most important things.
 Yes, yes.
