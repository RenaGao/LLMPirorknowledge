I do want to tell my opinion about the last time talk between us.
I do form the part-time is as well as important as studying since it give us the actual experiences in the real world situation.
Hmm, but actually my senior has done the same with this even though their - their score is not that good or maybe just the - the average.  But when he or she got the actual experience with the part-time, they could be able to be accepted into the company just like after they are graduated.
Oh yeah.
I don't want such thing to be happen to me for sure.
I will try to push myself - myself on the studying as well as the part-time job.
Maybe I could place my part-time just right after I finish my studying, so maybe in the week off for example.
I am doing part-time in accounting field by counting the bicycle inventory.  We may know it by inventory checking - stock opening.
Maybe I will prove you with more evidence by the next semester.
Yes, got it, sir.
Yes.
