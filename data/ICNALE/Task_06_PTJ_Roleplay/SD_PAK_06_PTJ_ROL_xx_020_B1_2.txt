Uh, sir, it's my personal problem, so I'm facing some financial problems so I had to work for my study.  My parents wanted me to a good students and so I can do all these things by money.  If I don't have money, I can't do anything.
Sir, actually, my father is dead.  I have family.   I have to run my family.  There is no one back on my shoulder for a family so I have to work.
Sir, actually, when someone support me from my back, so I would - maybe I would, uh, leave my job but no this is - I have to do for my family.
I don't think so.
Would pay the money back.
But sir this is the family problem.  If my family allow me to, you know, leave all those activities---
I'm - I'm describing all my problems to my parents but actually for life we have to do all these things, you know, to run a family to - to teach our younger, uh, sisters, brothers, so everyone in my family.  So I have to take all those responsibilities.  That's all I want to say.
I can't leave my job sir but I promise you I would give more time to my study now.
I will arrange different activities regarding my studies.  So, I will improve myself and my study as well but I can't leave job.
