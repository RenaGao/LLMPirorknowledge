Okay, okay.  Um, um, as   um, as, uh - um, I think work is I think a, uh, uh, accumulating work experience is a one of a important, uh, in our, uh, life.  Uh, I don't think - I think there is some method for - for us to balancing, um, in academic, eh, or career, um, many - many students can afford - can - can, uh, uh, spend their time in, eh, either work and - or, uh, study during the, uh, study time and maybe I can still, uh, focus on my study but I - I can work after I have settled those, uh, in - uh, uh, studies stuff and - and I think I can still, uh, continue my career.
Um, uh, when it comes to final exam, um, for me final exam is, uh, in this is more important than my job so I've - I think I can just pause my job during the - some final examination period, but after the final examination period I can have more lesson time so that I can work even more before the final examination period to compensate for my, uh - my time loss in the final - final examination period.
Hmm.
Um, I've - um, I think I can awoke in working, uh, even more at before the final examination period because I think 14 days is enough to, uh, make me to - to - to work more before the time that I spent in - in before the final exam period because during this - during this moment we are - uh, I am very busy and maybe I can just, uh, attend, uh, I can - maybe I can just have attend to my job or - one to two days but after the final exam period, I can even work, uh, 6 days in - in a week.  So I think, um, the time should be enough for me to, uh, compensate the time loss, yes.
