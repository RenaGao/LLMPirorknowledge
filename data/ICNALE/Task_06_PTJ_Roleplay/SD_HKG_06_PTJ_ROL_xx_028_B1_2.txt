Uh, I think that I should, uh, continue working part-time because, well, it's - firstly, it's only part-time so there are still some free time for me to continue my research and studies.  And then, uh, also, uh, working part-time can give me some work experience so that, uh, I can - I can use my experience in the future.  So, uh, if - uh, given that I am a college student and eventually I have to go and work in the society so, uh, I think that knowledge is important, but then work experience is also important.  So, um, uh, I think that I should continue working part-time because I can gain experience but at the same time I also, uh - I - I can also grow some - I can also learn some knowledge about things that I couldn't learn from the, uh, lessons and lecturers and things like that.  So, um, also, uh, I - I will continue to work - I will work harder on my study so that I don't get to poor grades in my exams like studies and research.  So, um, I think that it's really okay for me to continue to work part-time.
Well, um, for my part-time job and I only work for like, uh, 4 to 5 hours per week.  So, for the rest of my time, like for the rest of the week, there are 24 times 7 minus 5 so I still got a lot of time to, uh, study and research and, uh, yeah.
