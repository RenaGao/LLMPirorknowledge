Hello.  Uh, I - I - I'm - I want to - I want you doing my part-time job because I can earn a lot of - a lot of experience from it.  With the part-time job, no college - the challenge with the part-time jobs, challenge, I can know how to fix a problem and with - with not - not get lost by the others and then, um, I want - and then a job is very important to me.  I speak a lot of people so that I can get the job.  If I give up this job, I think that the boss may look down on me - on us because we just give up easily.
Um, I'm a student, right and - but I think, student should not only study.  They can do a lot of things because - such as I'm working on this part-time job and I gain a lot of experience.  This experience may also benefit me.  When I finish my study, I will not be like others - others who do - who only study.  I can - I can tell the - tell the boss that I have been worked for long, long time.
This is my ben - this is my treasure, I think.
Research is very important.
And - but I - I do my part-time job, does not means that I cannot do my research very well.  Um, now my research - research may be not very go - going not - going on not very well but I can say this is because I'm not job - I'm not get well with my part-time job.  I'm now getting very well with my part-time job and then I should - I cannot - I can - do not spare my task to other things, just do part-time job and study.
If I always study, maybe I will be confused with other - such as computer games, basketball XXX  and then this - and then part-time job is not like - the reason why I get my - is not the reason why getting my study not very well and it's not the solution for my - for to get my study better.
