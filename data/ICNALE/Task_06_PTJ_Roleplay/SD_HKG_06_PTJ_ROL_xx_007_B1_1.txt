Um, because I think actually the way have a part-time job will not affect my study and I think doing part-time job can help me to earn more money that can buy stuff that I want and I can also gain some experience that can help me when I graduate.  Also, I think doing part-time job is my choice and my freedom, that's it, I don't, uh, eh, that I think I can continue my work.
Um, I think doing part-time job is only, uh, not my - not - will not use, uh, all the time and I can spend a part of time doing my part-time job, and I can also have time to go on my study.
Um, I think time management is very important and actually most of the college still don't have day off and they can use their day off to, eh, do the job and other days they can study.  And they can also study at nights, uh.
