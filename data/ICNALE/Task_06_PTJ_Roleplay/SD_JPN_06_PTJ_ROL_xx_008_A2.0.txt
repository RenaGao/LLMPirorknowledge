 Okay, hello professor, I want to keep my part-time job.
 My family --- my family is very poor  .
 So --- and my educational cost is very expensive, and they can't pay for it.
 So I --- I have to --- I have to earn money to --- to pay for my educational cost.
 I see, but actually scholarship is not enough to pay educational cost.
 I want to study more but --- but when --- when I see my parents, they --- they are hard --- they work hard to pay it.
 That makes me very ashamed.
 So, I want to do for them.
