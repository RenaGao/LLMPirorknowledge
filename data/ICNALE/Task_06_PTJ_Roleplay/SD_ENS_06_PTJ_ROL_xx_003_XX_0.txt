Well, I need the money for my social life and our - as you know, my paying the tuitions and college life is not easy.
That's right.  That part I understand, but I try my best to balance my studying as well as my working hours.
I agree with that, studying is my first priority, but at the meantime as in the life that we live, we do need some extra income.  As long as I can keep up with my studies and make the extra time to do my study and do a good job, doing my homework and study, I can also put some hours  .
That I understand.  In life, we also need to have - as you can see, a cost of living in the society is high and we also need the happiness in our life.  And to have that without extra money that we need to spend time with our friends and have the social life, studying will not be the only thing that we can enjoy.
That's true, but as you can see, my grades are average, I am keeping up with my studies, I have full confidence  .
There is always potential to get better and better in life, but the job is not only for the money, it is also build up our skills to have social life, to learn how to interact with customers, with people in society.  So it's that part is also important to be in an active person in society.
Okay, thank you.
