Ma'am, can I, can I continue my job because I think this is what I need the most, because if it isn't, if it isn't for my job, I won't, I wouldn't be able to study, because this would help my parents, in my, parents in paying for my tuition fees.
Ah, to compromise, the thing that I would want to suggest is I will try my best and I will try to manage my time more.
Though I said that last time, but I think I, it might not be a big result.  But I think I am slowly improving.  It's, it's not a big leap.  But I think in the long run, I will, I'd be able to do it and  
I think during my break times in my job, I can try doing my homeworks, my activities in every way that I can, especially in the commute.
I think I can put some time in doing my homeworks instead of just sitting on the car or vehicle.
