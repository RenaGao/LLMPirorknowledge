So, sir, it has come to my attention that you require me to stop from doing my part-time job.
But sir, I have to uh decline that because you know my family economic condition right now is not good.  We have - we are in tight money and so I want to continue this part-time job not only because I need to help my parents but also it become the source income for - for me to pay my college tuition.
I think I will rather choose part-time job because not only  
---it gives me money, it also challenge me to become a better person and also it give me new experience, so not only I can apply what you taught me in college, I can also open my eyes to wider work.
But sir, I can assure you that this is only temporary.
I - because my part-time job currently uh is very time taking.  I am very busy with my part-time job but I can assure you that this is not permanent.  It will calm down after a few weeks.  So, in those few - in the future I can catch up to my studies.
Yes, absolutely. 
Okay, so my part-time job is actually a stock opening on an audit company, so it not only requires me to be present there, I have to count their stocks one by one which is taking a toll to my physique, to my body.  And so when I come home from my part-time job, I cannot really concentrate on my study and I usually I spend my nighttime sleeping instead of studying.  I think that's why my grade has been dropping.
Okay, sir.
Thank you.
