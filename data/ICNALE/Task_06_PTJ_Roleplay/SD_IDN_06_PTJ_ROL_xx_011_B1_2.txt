Okay.  Excuse me sir.

Okay.
Okay.  Excuse me sir.
As you already know, you have already send me a message.
About that I can't continue my part-time job.  Could you explain me why the reason because I really need this part-time job.  Thank you.
Not really sir.
Okay, because as you already know, actually I really need this part-time job because I have to make money because I - I am far away from my parents.
Yeah, because they already not working anymore and then I also had so many brother - little - and little brother and sister.  And also about my study, I think if you can give me some more time, I will try hard to fix it and then I mean like can you please give me 1 or 2 months to fix it and we can take a look at how the results and then if it's not good enough, you still can ask me to quit, but if it's already better than before or even better than all of your students, can I still continue my part-time jobs?
Okay, I see sir.  Thank you for your suggesting.  Maybe I will try to search some of scholarship but then meanwhile I try to get scholarship, I will still continue the part-time jobs until finally I got   the scholarship and maybe that's only the solution.
Oh well.  I have the part-time job at the restaurant and the restaurant give me more money than I - I mean then the limit of salary, so it can helps   me to survive because I also have to work for my little brother and sister.  So that's all.
Okay sure.
Okay sure.
Okay.  See you.  Thank you.
