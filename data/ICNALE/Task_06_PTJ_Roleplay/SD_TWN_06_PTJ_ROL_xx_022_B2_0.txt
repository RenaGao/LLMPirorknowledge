I think this is, uh - uh, this is quite personal because, uh, if I am a student working is my own business and passing the exam or not is not the supervisor's job.  So, it is me have to make a balance between my work and my studies.
Okay.  Uh, I think I will have to re-arrange my - my life, uh, like trying to because I think the job is that you - you can quit when you want.  You have to take a time - take some time.  So, uh, I have to, uh, see how I performance   on my study and think of it for a while.
Uh, okay, I will try to quit my job because, uh, working they have, uh, uh---  
Contract.
Yes.

I still have to work until a period
Yes.
Um, I can't get the, uh - the money that if you are quit that you can get a little money.
And uh, and I may not be able to get back to my work when I was fine with my studies.
