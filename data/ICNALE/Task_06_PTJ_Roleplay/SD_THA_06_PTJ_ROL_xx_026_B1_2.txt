Hello!
  I work a part-time job.
But I have no money and it is very important to me.
Uh, my parent is work hard and they have a - expense - their - the estimate for them, so I want to stop them and I can arrangement my time to work it very well.
How?
After I work a part-time job, I reading a book for 30 minutes and I have a time for sleep.  I think it's okay for me to work and learn together.
I - I can manage my - my time and if I tired, I should sleep but I do care about my study too.
I will study hard - harder than I do.
I am sure.
Uh, it's okay.  Thank you.
See you.
