 Hello, uh, I want to continue my part-time job uh for my, uh umm for my umm daily life.
 And uh I --- I received uh some scholarship uh but uh it's not enough for a living uh and my parents have not, don't have so much money because uh they have to uh keep their money for a --- for a living uh after they stop working.
 Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm, uh, uh, there is a limit of uh the amount of money we can borrow uh from government.
 Uh, as you know, uh, we can borrow money uh up to 12 umm uh 12,000, umm, 12,000, no, uh, umm, uh.
 200, umm, 200, umm, uh, okay, uh, there is a limit of money, uh, the amount of money uh we can borrow.
 So uh even if I, I, umm, I borrow much more money, uh, it's still uh not enough, so---  
 Um-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm, uh, uh, so uh, if I go to the conference, uh, it needs very much money.
 Uh, even if it will uh be returned uh from school --- from university, but uh we have to uh pay uh money at, umm, pay money to go to conference.
 It needs very uh very much money.
 So, uh, umm, the --- the amount of money I receive now is enough for daily life maybe, but uh if I think about going to conference or---  
 Or uh umm when --- when I go to conference, it needs very much money.
 Hmm.
