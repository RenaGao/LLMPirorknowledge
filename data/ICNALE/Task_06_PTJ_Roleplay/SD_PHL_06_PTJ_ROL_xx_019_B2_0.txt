And right now, there is not, not much of a problem, right.  I've been, I've been doing my best though it is tiring.  But I know the consequences.  It is really hard for college students not having a job before they go to the real job to be honest.  It's really hard that, it is a privilege to experience this, like to be a part-timer for you, because  
I think okay, I'm got to wind up and tell you that, yeah I do think for now it's affecting me, because it's, because it's a probably hell week in, in the college and I don't think I can do better.  Now that you told me my mistakes, I will own up to it.  I will do it again.  Just give me another chance and I will do my best.
