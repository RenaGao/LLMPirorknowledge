Uh, I would like to continue my job, uh, while be able to continue, uh, studying at the same time.
Because I would like to have a - have income for me to be able to afford different necessisties  , for example, pen, pencil for me to continue my study.
Uh, however, the weather is getting cold and I would like to be able to afford some clothing or, uh, hot food for my family or, ha - uh, be able to afford dinner with my friends as well.
Uh, yes.
I don't think it's much a problem as I have a perfectly, uh - perfect time schedule, uh, for my studying and I already planned that out, it looks perfect, and I think that with this timetable I am able to balance both the job and my studying and I am able to have in-depth revision on, um - on different courses for best preparation for the exam.
