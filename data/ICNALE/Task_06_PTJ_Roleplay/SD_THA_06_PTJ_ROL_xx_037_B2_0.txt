Yes.
Yeah, I know but as to have money - I will have to get money, teacher.  I - I have problems and even then get this part-time job and I studied, I get a lot more, uh, trouble, so please let me do this.  
Uh, I mean - I want to get more experience.  Study is not the whole thing, so I want to work and get, um, experience and other graduate maybe this is a process for me to have the chance to get to the company or the firms because I have an experience on working.
But I still focus on it but I have the time to work the part-time job, so I can do both thing at the same time.
Uh, I think - I can manage my time and manage it everything that I think, um, growing up tired is not the big deal.
Yeah.
Not really but I think I can work and study, uh, together - along together.
Uh, but I think you will see.
I see it has negative, um, effects for me, so I will quit, but now, I think it is - it is not a big deal for me and, um, I am still - I will still--- 
Yeah.  Thank you.
