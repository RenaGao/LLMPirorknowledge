But I have to because I need - uh, I need some mon - money for my - for my living.  I know that is going to inf - is going to give the negative influence on my study, but I think I can manage my time.
Because I don't want to bother them.  They pay me a lot and I - but sometime I need money for my - to buy the stuff that I - I like to have and is - is not, um, is not an important stuff, uh, is not about the studying.  I don't want to ask them for that.
I - I see, but doing - doing part-time job is not - is not that bad, uh, is help me to - is help me to be more responsible with my life.  And if I - if I have to go for work, I will - I will know - I will have a goal for that today, for that day that, oh, I have to go to work, so I have to finish my homework or assignment before.  So, is help me a lot on managing my - my life.
Um, I will fin - I will do my part first like as soon as possible.  I will finish my part, I will be responsible for the - for my part that I work - on my project and then send them to my friend.
Um, I think if - if I man - if I manage the time well, I am not - I will have the - enough time to - to take rest, to study and to work.
Okay.
Okay, all right.
Good bye.
