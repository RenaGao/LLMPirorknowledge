Okay.  So - so I'm sorry that I had to continue my part-time work because, um, first I think I won't let the part time to influence my study because I choose the - the time is - is in the afternoon and not in - at night, so it won't affect my sleeping time and I can use the - the time at night to study
And, um, my habit - and my habit is, uh, I have - I have to sleep before - before the midnight.  Yeah, so I won't stay up.
Um, because, um, yes, my parents stopped to - stopped giving the pocket money.
Yes, and - and they want to - and so the - the money of eating or the transport have to - I have to pay for it - these things.
But I think it's that the paying - I have to - yes, it's - it's that this pay and I have - I think I will - I have to - um, I have to share the burden from my home yes, and my sister, um, start to work at part time during - during the university.  So, I think I had to work part time too so that is fair to her.
But I think it's very important to have some experience from working.  So - so when I have to go into society and I graduate and this part-time experience will be my, uh, advantage when I--- 
I think the interaction between the classmate or some peers is not - is not understand with the - I interact with the customers and my - and my boss and this is not the same, yes, because it's like the - um, because we won't - uh, we won't speak to the customer just as we're - we're talking with our friends.  Yes, the level is not the same.
