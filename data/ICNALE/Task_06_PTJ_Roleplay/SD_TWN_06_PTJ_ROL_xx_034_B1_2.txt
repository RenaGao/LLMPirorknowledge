Um, excuse me, professor.
I really need to get a part-time job.
Yes.
Um, but I really cannot because my family has some financial problems.  So, I really need to keep on this part-time job.
Yes.
I'm really sorry about that, but if I don't get the part-time, I can - if I can't continue my part-time job, I could be starving.  I - I mean because my - you know, my dad's company was bankrupt last month and so our credit line just being lower and lower.
And my mom just need XXX  operation next month.  If we don't have the money, then we could be starving and cannot just - cannot live.  I don't know.
No.  Just as I said - as I've said, our credit line just being lower and lower because my dad's comp - company just bankrupt.
Yeah.
I have---
I have tried because we are a family.
The bank will have a list to check out our family's condition now, so I really need to keep on this.
I - I'd like to and I would try to but please just let me, just keep on this job.
Okay.
Thank you so much professor.
