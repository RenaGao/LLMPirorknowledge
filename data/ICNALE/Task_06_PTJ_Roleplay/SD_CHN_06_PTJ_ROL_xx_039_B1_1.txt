Hi teacher.
And I had a part-time job several days ago.
And I thought you have something to speak to me.
I am sorry teacher.  Um, but, I - I'll try my best to have this part-time job and I didn't thought - I didn't think it influence my academic study.
Some other reasons about my relationship with my friends.
Firstly, I think have this - having - having this part-time job can give me more experience and I can write it on my CV in the future and secondly, I think I really love this part-time job because I can practice my communication skills with other people.
Last, but not least, I really need some money these days.  I want to buy something for my father.
Yes I balance.
Okay, thank you teacher.
