Uhm, excuse me sir, but I don't want to be resigned.
Uh, no, but I need the money because my - my father is about to retire in - in three months.  And my brother didn't finish college.  And I need to also help my father finance the family.  
Yes.
No, but as a matter of fact I am not - I don't have anything that can make me be eligible to apply for  
Scholarships like any achievements or some sorts.
Getting a student loan, no, I don't think so, I would like - I don't like the mindset of having debts.  Yeah, and so I would like - I would prefer to work for my money.
Uh, I think I can manage the time very well, because  
So, now is my last semester and I am only - I only have one class per week, so I have an abundant amount of free time.  So I can use the free time for working - working here.  And since it is only one subject, I can easily do the assignment after the class is over.
I will still pick the work because I need the money more.
It is about prioritizing sir.
And I think I can manage that pretty well.
Uhm, I'm not really doing much.  I am just like a - a busboy, like I mean cleaning the floors and washing the dishes.  And that's not even tiring or much for me.
Yes.
Okay, sir.
Okay, definitely.
You're welcome.
