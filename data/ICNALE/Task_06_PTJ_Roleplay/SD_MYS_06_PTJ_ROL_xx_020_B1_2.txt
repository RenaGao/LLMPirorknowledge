Doctor, I really need this job.  I need it.  I need to - I need - I need this job.  I need to pay my tuition.  I need to - why should I leave if I don't work.
Yes, I can promise you I will.
I'm different from them.  Trust me, if you give me this chance, I will do my best really.
I'm going to - I'm going to make - spare time to study to make homework.  I will do everything to make sure that my studies won't affected - won't be affected by my work.
Yeah, I'm so sure.  Please, please believe me.
