All right.  Ah, ma'am, I would like to continue my work and study, because ah, if I don't continue my part-time job, I cannot afford to pay my tuition fee for the studies.
Umm, I really need to do the part-time job.  I will just improve my effort and submit all the needed requirements for the academics.
Oh, I cannot really, I cannot really stop my part-time job, because if I stop my part-time job, I can't really afford.  I will really, I will really improve my performance in the future.
I think I will manage my time more and I will ah, bring more attention to my academics than the part-time job.
