Excuse me sir.
Uh this, actually I have some part-time job.
---and I think I want to do it more longer because I have some economic stuff and I don't want to make my parent worry me because in this - in this place I do it alone I live alone here and meet my parents so far away.  So, I cannot worry them more than now.
Uh, actually no sir, because I think that this semester going to be so hard than I - I - I cannot take it the place with my friend.  So, I cannot get a good grade.  But I think I can make it better and that's not because my part-time job.
Yeah.
Uh, I have tried scholarship but until now I still cannot get that one of the scholarship and a student loan.  I think I cannot take it because when I take it I have - I have to think how to pay it back.
Yeah, I want to do it.
Uh, I think I will try to make a shift in - I have to divide the shift with my college time, with my study, and with my job.  Actually I have a part-time job in some of information stuff I have to put the data and I have to administrate the online stuff of that office.
Okay, sir.
