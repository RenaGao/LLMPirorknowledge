Okay, um, I - I am sorry that I really don't think that my part-time job is really affecting my study because actually my part-time job is now being a part-time tutor, an English tutor, which I think actually help my study, because like I am now studying some courses which are, uh, related to linguistics and I think what I have learned can used in my part-time job, which can en - uh, reinforce my memory, um, and maybe doing some demonstration in the classes which actually really help my study.
Uh-hmm.
Um, first of all my part-time job only, um, happen in weekend, one, uh, in Saturday only, so which I have got a day off on Thursday and I have got a Sunday to complete all my jobs, and actually I will do some revision or do some preparation at night every day.  And so I don't think it actually gives any like, um, affecting my study because I got it - got it a better GPA in last semester so I think that didn't affect me.
No, from year one actually.
Umm, um.
