Uhm, well, recently I have a part-time job.
Uhm, as you know I am a student at the university.
Yeah - your student.  So I need a part-time job uh, because, you know, I need to have money.
Yeah, I apologize, yeah, so.
Okay, so I will study more, but I do need my part-time job.  Without it, I cannot buy books or anything that I need.
Uhm, I didn't know.
Okay, thank you.
Well, like if the teacher tell me how to do it without actually working, so yeah.
