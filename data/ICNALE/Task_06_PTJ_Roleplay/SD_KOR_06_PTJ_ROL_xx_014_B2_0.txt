Well, first thing that I need money to go to school and study or living, so I need a lot of money.  I need it but actually my parents couldn't support me, so I need to earn some money to - for school, so of course you might think that part-time - part-time job is, um, it's hard to study but I - I think that I can study hard and have a good score with having part-time job so, um, I think---.
But now I'm getting scholarship but it's not enough for a living.
So, I think part-time job is really, really, um, I really need it, like scholarship is not enough.
Yes but now I have my sister and brothers and also my parents have to support them, not just me, so it's really hard for pa - it's really hard for me to ask my parents to support me the whole of things so I will - I will study hard and also I will work hard so you - I think I hope that you might admit me to work.
But I have to work to study.  I - we have to buy some books and we have to buy some - like in my major, I have to buy some tools like XXX   or like XXX   like things like that so---
Parents?
Uh, if I per - persuaded them but they can't support me then after that, how can I work XXX
