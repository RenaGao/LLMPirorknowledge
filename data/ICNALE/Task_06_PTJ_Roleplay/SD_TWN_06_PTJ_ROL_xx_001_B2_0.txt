Um, hi, supervisor.  So, um, recently you told me to stop working, because it would likely influence my study and research.  However, I think my part-time, my part-time job in some cases can help me more efficiently, uh, to do my study.
Um, like uh, if I have like 20 - if I have like 18 hours a day to do things, but I will mostly waste it on - on not doing things like just watching TV.  So, having a part-time job can help me more efficiently personalize my time.  I can, um, I can use, uh, like when I had the part-time job daily, so I had - it means I had only like 6 hours left.  So, I will try to do much things as within these 6 hours.
Yes.
Um, that - that come   to my second point.  I think, um, communicating with others and learn how to, uh, like so - uh, social with others is really important.  So, part-time jobs, um, I think it helps me go outside of the comfort zone.
It's one, uh - it's one important experience I can experience in college time.
Um, because my part-time job is not, uh - not in the campus, uh, and eventually I would go out of the campus to actually know about - uh, like know about people in the workplace.  So, it will be better for me to, uh, stay out of the comfort zone and not just make friends in the campus but, um - but in the real world.
