Yes.
Do I like speaking English?  Actually, not yet.
Uh, because when in elementary school, uh, I usually, uh, fail in English.  Uh, maybe, because I don't, um, go out to learn more English, just in school.  So, I can---
Um, so I can - I don't know how teacher teach us, vocabulary or something else.
A week?  Uh, except in school or---
Now?
In school, only, uh, maybe, 4 hour a week.
Yes.
With who?  Usually, I, um, learn English by myself, so just myself.
Uh, yes.
Um, I want to speak in English class but I seldom speak out.
Because I scare, I can't say a - a correct word.
I want - I - I afraid I can't.
Because, uh, because---
Uh, yes both, then - in uh, I - I can't tell, uh, something in English with others and I also will nervous when I need to say English with them.
Uh, I want to, uh, improve - improve my English speaking, uh---
Uh, I don't do something to improve.
One to one or---?
I prefer one-to-one because it just two people and not very difficult to me.  Uh, one-to-one will be more, uh, comfort to me.
Yeah.
Most important, actually I think speaking is most important, uh---
Because we - we usually need to meet with, uh, some people from other country and English is very formal - normal - normal language and, uh, if you want to tell your thought you can just - you can't just write down your thought and then take, then look.  You need to say out, speak out.
