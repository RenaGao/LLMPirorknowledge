Okay.
Sure.
Very much.
I live in America for 2-1/2 years.
And that makes me speak lot of English.
So, I like it very much.
I'm not sure, but I speak often in class and sometimes - sometimes I meet foreign students, I speak English.
Just normal lifestyles like such as just - just like asking how you're doing, what's stuff like.
Yes.
Absolutely!
I want to improve my English.
Just everyday life, you know, hmm, like speaking in business---
Such matter.
Yes.
I watch many American dramas---
You know like, yeah, like all dramas like comic is like Friends.
And also movies---
---without no captions---
---because we have so like.
Hmm, I think one-in-one is much better.  It's because I can use other languages if someone don't understands me, and there is no much difference between those two, but I think just one-in-one is---
---comfortable for me.
Just one?
Uh, the speaking is I think, is most important thing, because when you speak, you also listen what you are saying.  So, I think that's the most important skill.
