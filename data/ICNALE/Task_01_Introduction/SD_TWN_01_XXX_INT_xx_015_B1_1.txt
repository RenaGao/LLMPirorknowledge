Yes.
Um, it depends because I need to express my feelings while the other people know what I'm saying.
Yes.  Because I -- I try to express my feelings in English to my classmates but - high school classmates.  
So they always didn't get my point, so yes.
Feel about confused.
A week?  Um, probably not.
English class, once a week.
With - with classmates or teacher
In maybe group discussion.
Or just answer the questions the teacher asks.
Topics just - many topics.
Such as marriage, landscaping, Halloween and Christmas.
Yes.
Um, just about the daily life.
Such as my habits, my favorite food or restaurant.
Um, maybe, I will watch some English movies.  
Um, or some English - oh, watch TED.
I think because I will shadow their talks.
"Shadow" means they - and speecher   - speecher   says--- 
Speaker say the sentence and I - I check the sentence if the whole sentence is difficult to me.
I'll check - check the grammar or just the vocabulary.
And to pretend what he or she says.
I prefer a group discussion.
Because, uh, the other one does not focus more like one-to-one convers - uh, one to one conversation.  Um, group discussion is more like the whole group--- 
---not just focused on me.
So, it's not that stressful.
I think the speakability is most important because I think language is to express your thoughts or feelings.
