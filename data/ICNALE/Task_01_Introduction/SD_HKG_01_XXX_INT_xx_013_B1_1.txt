Yeah.
Hmm, sometimes I like.
Because it - it wasn't my mother language so sometimes like when I have to express some of my ideas I may have to think a lot in my brain before I use English to express it.
Oh okay.
In a week?
Basically, I think every day I will speak English.
Hmm, mostly in school with like some of my teachers or sometimes it's because of the discussion of the school projects or assignment and sometimes I will use it in my part-time job also because I will face some of the foreign customers so I have to use English to communicate with them and ask them mix also.
To improve my English speaking, usually, I will like revise some of the like tenses of grammar exercise to confirm that I - I can use it wellly and sometimes I will also listen to English news like BBC or sometimes even from the TVB Pearl channel and then some of those like drama like learn from their expression of English also.
Hmm, like in my - sometimes I will speak English with my brothers also because he is a secondary student and he have to improve his English also so sometimes I would taught him with English to improve his level also.
Hmm, actually I prefer one - one-on-one speaking.   
---rather than group because if like speaking in group I have to pay much more attention by listening to each groupmates of their speaking and I have to analyze what they have talked also, and sometimes it might happen often that few - a few people speak at one time and I might not listen to their ideas also.
The most important skills I think, first, it should be listening, because if you don't understand what the other said to you, then you couldn't be able to communicate with them also.  So, in my own feeling - opinion I think listening is the - is come first.
