Yes, you can.
Hmm, so-so, not really like speaking English.
It is not a simple task for me.
Uh, usually I don't speak English.
In my daily life.
Hmm, so maybe once a week.  In English class, I will speak English.
With my classmate.
Hmm, we discuss about some topic--- 
Our teacher give us.
Hmm, such as uh, marriage and any - I don't know how to speak the English of XXX  .
Horoscope, okay.
Yes, I want more - more chance to speak English in English class.
Every topic is okay for me.
Maybe, something like this, about my life, I can feel familiar with it.
Uh, okay, maybe I can try more chances to use English to talk with my classmate.  More practice can improve my English speaking skills.
I prefer group discussion, because sometimes I don't have to speak.  I just can sit there and listen someone's ideas and that's more easy for me.
I think speaking is the more important skill, because you learn a language, then you have to use it to communicate with other people.  So, speaking is the most important one.
