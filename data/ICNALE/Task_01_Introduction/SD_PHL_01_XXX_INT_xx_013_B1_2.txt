Okay.
Ah, yes.
It somehow seems to   quite professional.
Mostly about three times a week.
Mostly with my colleagues in the school and professors.
Mostly about academic topics.
But I think I'm quite comfortable with my, my speaking chances.
Well, more in academic, engineering, and some creative topics.
Well, I read a lot and try to speak in front of a mirror by myself.
Well, I think I'm quite comfortable with the one-to-one conversation since ah, I'm not, I'm a shy type person.  So, I'm quite comfortable with one-on-one conversation.
I think it's listening, because if you listen to someone, you can respond, respond immediately with an accurate answer if you listen well.
