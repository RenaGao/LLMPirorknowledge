Sure.
I think it's general.
Because my major is English, so when we have class, we must speak English with our teachers or classmates.  But after class, uh, we talk to our friends, we use our mother tongue is more often.
As the last question, my major is English, so I speak English is very, mm, frequent.  I think every week we need to speak English every day.
Yeah.
Sure.  Because after we graduate from the college, we need to find a job, which is - mm, which is match - matched with our majors, so, uh, speak - speak English is a very important skill for us.
I think the - the story or some - some life is---
Yeah.  Daily life.
Yes.
First, I think the vocabulary is very important because when we want to explain something to others, if we don't master the enough words, we can't explain exactly to - to them.  And maybe finally the meaning will have something wrong.
Yes.
Yeah.
I think both are good because I will call as two sides.  Uh, when we - when we talk something serious, I think one-to-one talk is - uh, is better because in this way we can - we can explain our opinion more exactly and improve our English as much as possible.  But when we have class, uh, our teacher often gave us a topic and when we will have a conversation with other single team, in this way, uh, we can exchange different opinions with others.  This is also a very good way to improve our English speaking.
Yes.
I think speaking is the most important one.
Because except our study at school, uh, in the four types, speaking is - uh, is more important.  When we - we talk to others in our daily life or we - we - we seldom to write or do something else to - do something else with others.  Uh, we rarely talk in - talk to others to - to share different ideas.
Yes.
