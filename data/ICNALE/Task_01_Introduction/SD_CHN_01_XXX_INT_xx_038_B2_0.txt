Yes.
Uh, no.
Uh, because when I, uh, speak in English I often feel, uh, nervous and I think that when I speak in English I can't quite, uh, really think uh - I can't really quite, uh, organize my speech, yeah and I can't speak very fluently.
Uh, I think, uh, every day.
Uh, of course, yes because I think speaking is a very important skill for every English learner and I think in China we often, uh, lack the situation in which we can speak English with one another.  So, I think, uh, more chances will be good.
Uh, all the topics.
Uh, um, I think maybe the first thing is to talk to myself because I often, uh, lack the situation in which I can talk with, uh, another, uh, people in English, uh, so I often talk to myself in English.
Uh, I think it will help, but not that much I think because if you don't speak in yourself you cannot really - uh, really - uh, understand the skill, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
One-to-one.
Uh, because in that way, uh, people can exchange their views without much barrier.  But I think in group - uh, group what - group discussion.
Yeah.  In group discussions, uh, some people may feel nervous and embarrassed, uh, and they don't want to, uh, speak in English.  But it is in our group so people will not notice that, yeah.  
Speaking.
Uh, because I think the main role of language is to communicate with each other and I think speaking is the fastest way to communicate with each other, yeah.
Uh, reading is important too.  Actually, these four skills is of equal importance I think.  But if I had to choose one, I will choose speaking.
