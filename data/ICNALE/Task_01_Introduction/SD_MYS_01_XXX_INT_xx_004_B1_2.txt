Walaikum Assalam.
Yeah sure.
Yes, I do the speaking in English.
Because ah it sharpens my mind besides speaking my mother tongue language XXX  .
In a week, not that many times I guess.  But, let's say if I meet a person who speaks in English then I also communicate in English.
Ah-mm.
Like with the lecturers during the English class or some of my - some of my friends do speak English, so yeah.
Basically it's like a daily conversation just like, hmm.
Yeah, normal conversations that happen.
Yeah, I would love to.
Well, I love psychology like the topic around that thing.  So, I mean if I will be given that chance I am in - into that thing I guess the psychology.
Okay, so like I like love watching movies.  So like one of the ways of me learning English is through the movies and listening to music.
Music
Sorry, can you repeat.  
Probably the one-one-one type of talking.
Yeah having a conversation.
Because, ah-hmm, because - because ah-hmm I enjoy the discussion and all, but then I don't really like I just enjoy having the one-to-one like face-to-face conversation rather than XXX  .
Ah-hmm, for me it would be speaking.
Because like as an example if you go to like other countries then the way of communication is like through speaking.  So, writing is also important but then if you want to go like outside from your own country then I guess English is one of the main language that people are used to communicate with each other.
Yes.
