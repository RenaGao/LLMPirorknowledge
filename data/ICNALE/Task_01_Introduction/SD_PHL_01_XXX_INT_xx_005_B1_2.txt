Sure.
Yeah.
Because it is the universal language and it makes it easier for me to communicate with foreign countries, to foreigners and actually, whenever I am in trouble like finding directions or finding people, finding places where I needed to go, I can use English to communicate with them.
Uh, usually, I use English for communicating with my friends online, especially in games because most of them are from other countries.
We talk about a lot about games.  We spend lot of communication - excuse me, um, conversations about in-game items or strategies, something like that.
Yeah, because it practices my - or it - it enhances my skill.
Um, I think I want to teach my skills or my specialties or specialization in English.
I practice my English verbally and in writing.
Usually, I comment on people or talk to them verbally about---  
Certain topic.
And then, if I think I should revisit the dictionary or something that offers English, maybe - maybe I should practice more on it.
I would prefer group discussions.
Because if given the same wavelength, I could express more of my information to them.
For me, it is reading and listening.
Because usually, if somebody gives me instructions to follow, usually it - it comes in written instructions or verbal instructions.  So listening and reading is really important so that I could understand which or what instructions are---  
Oh between these two?
Uhm, I think it would be listening.
