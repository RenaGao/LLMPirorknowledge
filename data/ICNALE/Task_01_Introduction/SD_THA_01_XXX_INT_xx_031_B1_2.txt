Yes, I do.
Uh, because I think I am good at speak - speaking more than reading or writing and--- 
Yeah.
I think around five days a week.
With my friends mostly, and situation is like just randomly when we were having lunch or when we are in the class, and the topic is like all daily life like what did you do last night, when did you go to sleep.
Yes, of course.  I do.
Um, I think about the education.
Yeah.
Mostly I watch, uh, movies, watching interviews or video created from YouTube, and I try to use - I try to speak like - like them, imitate them.
Yes.
Like some word that I have - I cannot pronounce or I haven't heard before, I try to pronounce as them.  Or sometimes just lip read after them.
I like one - one to one because I - I think one to one speaking, uh, communication is like, you can - you - you are - you are talking with people - only one people and you are not - we will not, uh, you will not get nervous for me - for me.
The most important skill, I think reading.
As the - as there is a lot of information that you can get from the book, sometime there is not - there is no information from the - the vid - I think video or the record that you can listening to.  So, sometime - so, most of the information you can get from the book.  I think reading is the most important.
