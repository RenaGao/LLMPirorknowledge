Uh, sure.
Sometimes.
Uh, uh, because uh, because I read a lot in English, so uh, uh, speaking in - speaking in English helps me think more efficiently.
Uh, because, uh, while reading the text, you have to translate into Chinese and then, thinking in Chinese and then, translate into English again.  So, uh, speaking English like, it helps me understand the text more.
Uh, you mean uh, to other people or---?
To other people maybe, uh, maybe once a month when I meet some foreigners.
Uh, probably on the street when they - when they get lost and I have to show them the direction.
Uh, uh, I - not really, uh just for some English classes  
I will speak English  
If necessary.
What kind of topics?  Um, while presentation  
And talking about the XXX  .
That's all.
Uh, in uh, speaking in class or---?
Foreigners?
Foreign students in China, I haven't met any, so  .
Um, but I think uh, I used to work in library, so  
So, I got a lot of foreigners to ask me uh, where to visit in XXX  .
Sure.
TV shows, TV dramas, uh, movies on Netflix.
Um, read the text, uh read some English novels--- 
---uh, in the first place and then, mostly, uh, I learn my English on Netflix.
Speaking?  Um, I usually practice on my own, I - um, when I watch the TV show and I, uh, encounter some words that I cannot pronounce, then I will stop and just repeat after the character.
Yeah.
Just probably every time I watch the T - TV show, I would encounter some words I don't understand.
Uh, group discussion.
I like to, um - I want to know more about others opinion.
And one-to-one conversation is more faster.
Uh, I think first, uh, I think speaking is the most important, uh, because even if you can read or listen like when you got lost in foreign countries, you have to ask them, you have to express yourself.
