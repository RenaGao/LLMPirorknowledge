Salaam Alaikum.
Yes.
Ah, yes, I like to speak in English.
Ah, because it can improve your English skills and it can also um, connect you to other people like um, ah, from different countries.  It's not like um, I - other than that we as Malaysians also sometimes speak in English just you know in the conversation.
Um, in a week?
I think---
Not much, may be like 5 or 6.
Ah, sometimes my friends.
Or myself.
Um, sometimes during our lab work sessions or like meeting at a caf�� ah, or in the room.
Ah.
Ah, just - just like what we did just now, chit-chat, some boring topics like girls talk.
Ah, yes.  I would like to because um, I think that right now my English is not that okay because I haven't speak English speaking with other person you know because I rarely meet in  one room  here.  So I guess it's kind of good if you can speak English with anyone else.
Um, it can be anything.  I don't mind really um, life, work, relationship, advices, anything, friends.
Yeah.
Okay, ah, I listen to English songs.
I watch English movies.
Ah, but I think what helped me lot is when I was little, when I was a kid I usually watched cartoons in English.  Ah, I think that improved my English a lot in understanding what people are trying to say or like trying to speak to us.  At least we understand what they are trying to speak to us.
 Ah, I think I like both.  It depends on the situation.  You can - if there is no other people just like you and her or him then it's a two-way conversation.  If it's in a group then we can talk like everyone around.
I think ah, important?
Speaking I guess.
Because not anyone who can write can speak in English and not everyone can speak in English can write in English like okay let's say ah, you are writing an essay.  You have ideas but you cannot like speak English easily with other person because you have to write, construct the words inside your mind like how do you say it properly to that person, yes.
Yes.
