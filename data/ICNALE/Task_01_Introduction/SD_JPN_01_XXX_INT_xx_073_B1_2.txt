 Yes.
 Umm, because umm recently uh many foreign people speak English and --- and not only uh their mother --- mother tongue --- mother language.
 Uh, so if I can speak English, I can umm conversation   with umm many people.
 Ah, in 1 week?
 Umm, yeah, it's umm different but uh umm maybe once or twice a week.
 Uh, in which situation?
 Umm, because my close friends are foreigner  , so I speak with them umm in English or in their mother language.
 Uh, yes.
 Uh, I would like to talk about politics.
 And economics.
 Umm, yes, I try to umm watch umm YouTube or many uh umm TV programs.
 A lot of TV programs but like a Ted or kind of like.  
 Umm, yes because umm when I watch umm some programs in English, I learn some new vocabulary from that and I can uh use it later.
 Umm, private conversation---  
 I prefer one-to-one conversation.  
 Umm, hmm, because I think umm for Japanese, it is difficult uh-huh to uh discuss umm with a few peoples   because we don't learn in elementary school or junior high school.
 Um-hmm.
 Umm, in general or for Japanese?
 In general?
 It's speaking.
 Umm, because umm uh speaking is a tool to express myself.
 So if I can read and write and listening --- listen in English, if I cannot speak in English, I cannot uh tell people what I'm thinking about.
