Yeah.
Yeah, I like to speak in English  .
Uh it help   me to uh just like speaking because uh English is one of the language uh speaking - the people talking in the worldwide.
Okay.  I am sorry.  Uh because English is one of the language   that uh the people around the world uh talking to, so it makes me to understand what the people think about worldwide.
In a week, it's around 10 hours. 
Uh with whom - with my friends in my college.
Casual conversation.
Um - uh usually I am talking with an English section, talking about the movies---
---and just like songs.
Uh I usually more listening uh just like listening for the conversation of in the talk show and also listening music.
Um because uh something in the movies show us about the how to - how you speak in English in some situation and relate in our lives and just like the movie is representing what do you usually do in this life.
Uh-huh
I like uh one-of-one uh face-to-face.
One-by-one uh one-on-one because it's comfort me because we can speak uh focus in one topic and - and for group discussion I don't really comfortable because there is a lot of the eye looking at me.
I guess writing one.
Because - because when we are write something, we have think about how to write because and you thinks   about the grammar or specific word that maybe uh in the good one or not---
---and for like let's say for speaking section I guess you just say, uh not really focus in what grammar so I guess writing - writing is one of the uh learning section to improve or to upgrade my skill.
