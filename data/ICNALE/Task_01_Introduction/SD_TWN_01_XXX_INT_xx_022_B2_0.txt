Yes.
Uh, so-so.
Uh, speaking English make me feel, uh, unconfidence   - don't make me feel confidence.
Because I can't, uh, explain what I think, uh, fluently.
Seldom.
In English class.
Mm-hmm.
When we are asked to, uh, make some, uh---
Discussion.
All kinds of topics.
Uh, movie characteristics, uh, uh, holidays.
Uh, can you repeat it again?
No.
Speak English is a kind of pleasure for me.
Uh, listen more English, uh, programs like, uh, videos or radio.
Uh, I can go into the conversation situation.
And make some - same thing in my situation when I speak English.
Uh, one-to-one.
Because I can have more time think what I am going to say and even I can't, uh, even if I can't recognize what I want to say the other people will help me.
Listening.
Uh, because people well speak - uh, if others want to make you understand something, they will talk to you and if you don't understand, they will write later.
