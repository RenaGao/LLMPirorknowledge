Yes.
Yes, I like speaking in English.
Um, because it's another language from my motherland, so I think when I speak - when I am speaking in English, uh, it's like we exceled it sometime, you know, when somebody can't speak English so - but we can.
A week?
Not so often because I can only speak English when - only in class.
My teacher, but sometime I speak with my friend.
Um, if - if with my teacher, it's about, uh, class, it's about study, but with my friend, it's just normal life, everyday life.
Sorry?
Uh, yes.
Um, it's - it's anything, I just - if - if I can speak more English, it's better.
Yes.
Uh, I always watch movie in English with English subtitle and so I can learn how they pronounce and speak.
Well, I listen and I speak also.  I speak to myself.
Yes.
Uh, I would prefer group discussion because I think I - let me see, I - I like - I don't like the privacy, so one by one it's make me - sometime it's make me not confident.
The most important skill I think is speaking because if - if we all study everything, but we can't communicate so but it's important.
