Since I can speak with the, uh, foreigner people, I think it's very interesting.
In 1 week, I guess probably, in a seminar I will speak English with the - and speak with, uh, my classmates or - or the students in the seminar.
Yeah, yeah.
Not very often.
Yeah.
About my interest, like - uh, I like play basketball, so but in Japan I can hardly find people who like to play that sport.  So, if I can I will that - like that.
I think that first of all will be remember more vocabulary and sometimes the grammar is also important.  I guess, for me I am Chi - Chinese so the words will be the most difference, I think.
Um, it's hard to say but for me I would like to speak with groups.  We can have more people to cha - to exchange our ideas and that's - that's cool.
Yeah.
Important thing, probably the listening.  First of all, you can - you need to know what - what the - uh, what they are talking about and then you can think how to respond to them---.
