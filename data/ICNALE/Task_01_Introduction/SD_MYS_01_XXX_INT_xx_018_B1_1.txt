Sure.
Um - yes, I like - speaking in English, I like.
Because it is fun to know the language that not other people know.
About one of the times in a week.
With my friends, and sometimes with my lecturers.
Sometimes during the class and sometimes when we meet each other, we tend to speak English.
Basically with my friends, we talk about the - the - our life and sometimes about our family.
Sure.
Umm - a lot actually.
But I always like to talk about family and about animals, about nature.
Because - umm - in industries, we tend to - we need to speak a lot in English and even in the - umm - in the university we need also to speak in English.  So I think I want more chance to speak English like fluently.
Yes.
Umm - I basically learning to English song and - umm - speaking English with my friends.
I think by speaking English, even we know sometimes we speak wrong, but with friends we tend to teach each other.  If we get wrong, my friends will say, oh this is wrong, you need to speak like this.
Since I am an introvert, so I like to - in any - in any language, I would like to one to one conversation.
Because it is more personal and - umm - it's more heart to heart maybe.
The most important - I think, for me, speaking is the most important because  .
Because if we can speak, at least we can write something.  Even the grammar is wrong, but at least we can write.  But if we only can write, sometime we cannot speak in a good way.
Okay.
