Yes.
Uh, I think it's not about like or not like speaking in English.  I think for me it's more like a challenge and experience to do this.
I think I will choose like.
um, uh, because, um, languages represent culture and social society, so I think, uh, if I - if a person wants to learn a language means he or she is interested about this culture or this country, the person wants to learn more, uh, besides one his or her own cultural background.
Um, how often you mean time?
How many times---
Everyday I think.
With classmates or self-practice.
In which situation if it is with, uh, my peer who will be talking about like class - class problems and if I'm talking to myself, it may be just a thought come up in my mind and I want to express it in English.
Um, everyday situation I think.
Yes.
Um, daily life situation like conversation with friends and also news.
Yes.
Um, first, I think to improve my speaking - speaking ability, I have to improve my listening ability.
So, what I do is, uh, listen more and maybe YouTube or some media in English.
I think the most, uh, uh, evident one is the accent.
Yes and - and then it's the vocabulary.
The - the two are not making a big difference to me.
Because speaking English is trying to depress your thoughts, so even if one-on-one or in group whenever I want to express myself, I - I can - I can speak.
I think I will choose group.
Because, uh, group means more people, right---
---so we can hear from people's different opinions.
Yeah.
Writing, yes.
I choose listening.
Uh, because to me listening is the most basic ability of the four, if you cannot write or you cannot, uh, speak, then at least if you can listen, you can understand others and try a way to figure out how to express having another way.
