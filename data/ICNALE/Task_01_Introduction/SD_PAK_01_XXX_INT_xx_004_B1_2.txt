Yeah.
Yes, uh.
Because I belong to English department and I prefer to use English while speaking, uh, with my friends, teachers and with my colleagues and almost in interview I usually prefer to speak English.
Mostly when I am with my colleagues and teacher, often in class and---
These topics are mostly related to studies and - mostly related to studies.
Yeah, I have but I prefer to use the native language.
I would rather like, uh, to talk about politics and the daily routines and if there is a competent person or who - who can speak English with me, I can probably speak almost English.
I mostly look upon the things and do some, uh, research, uh, I mean that, uh, did some search on both - those words and read books and often watch TV serials which are in English from History channel or HBO channel.
In watching there is also a listening abil - uh, there is also a listening process that when one - uh, one is speaking we can understand the native like speaking that his or her accent and how they speak.  And in reading books, I can understand the grammatical errors and mistakes that I cannot do further.
I like the group discussion because in group discussion we can, uh, come across the many mistakes you did that every person has different ideas and different, uh, thinking - thinking capabilities so that anyone can pick you - picks your mistakes and errors.  And so that and we can correct our English.
I think that listening because when you are listening you are also watching and something that if you are listening on radio and this is only listening and then, uh, if you are watch - uh - uh, listening on TV then there is also watching you can see him or her what they are doing and how they are speaking and what are their gestures.
