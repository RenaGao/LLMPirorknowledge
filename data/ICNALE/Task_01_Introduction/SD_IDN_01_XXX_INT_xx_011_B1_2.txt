Yes, I like it.
I like it because I have learned English since I was in elementary school and I found it fun to speak English with my friends or my family.
Hmm, I will say about 12 hours a week.
Usually I speak English with my friends oversees because we still keep in touch and we used to be close friends and they usually ask how are you or what are you doing now?  That kind of things.
Yeah.
Like help my lecturer to translate paper or journals.
Usually, I watch movies without subtitles or although if there is some visitors from another country here, because it cannot - I help them to go around the campus or I am kind of the guide for them, so it also helps me to improve my English.
Okay, because sometimes after I watch the movies, I also try to communicate - I mean like try to make some conversation with myself or maybe with my friend after we watch the movies or maybe we kind of have forum, group discussion.  So, it helps me.
Actually, I like it better in one by one.
Because it's more intimate and I can take a look at my friend.
Yeah, at the partner eyes for something.
Speaking of course.
Because in speaking you don't have to care much about the grammar and also it helps you to communicate with other person so the basic English actually is speaking.
