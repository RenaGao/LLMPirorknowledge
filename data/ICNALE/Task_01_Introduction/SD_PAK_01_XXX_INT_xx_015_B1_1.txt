Yes sir, sure.
Yes, obviously something sometime.
Because our mother language is Urdu and so it is easily to, uh, speak in English because our relatives and our friend circle also speak in, uh, native language, sort of time for them to understand English.
In a week, almost on social media, some time and almost when there is, uh, some official as the students convey message, as convey with the teachers, etcetera, yeah, society members, so we speak English.
Yes sir.
Uh, basically, the open topics that's something that both the society issues and also something to build confidence, skills to understand the international scenario, it is very helpful because it is our international language, so easily can understand this.
Yeah, I use a grammar and basically the - we are, uh, learning from the basic and education, uh, English from books, etcetera from other, it is very tough time.
In addition, discussion, vocabulary also matters a lot because we have not a lot, uh, XXX  - uh, vocabulary for this, so grammar and vocabulary also important.
Spoken English.
Because when we have vocabulary, we speak easily.  If we don't have the words for something, um, any objects thing, TOH , we cannot speak it.
Yes sir.
Group discussion is more preferable sir.
Because these are interaction of different people, different area and different thinking, so we can - we can get different thoughts also from that because one-to-one, sometimes there is chance of their thinking match, but when there is a large - a large group of sons, TOH , a different, uh, point of view we will get.
Listening sir.
Listening first of all most, uh, preferable thing that when we don't listen to, TOH , we cannot understand what he is saying and what he is demanding.  If we listen them, then we can answer easily.
