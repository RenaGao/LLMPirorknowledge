Okay.
Uh, yes.
Because I think in the workplace we have to speak in English.
Uh, I think it's only 5 days in a week only in my class because we use English in our class.
Uh, I think more because actually in class it's at least 2 hours for one class.  So I think yes, 10 hours.
Uh with my friends and the lecturer, only that.
If it's talk with friend, it's only about the class, it's only about the lecturer. 
Yes.
I think listening to music and film.  Yes.
I think one-on-one conversation is better because I - we will speak more in the one-on-one conversation rather than group confirmation  .
Actually, I have - I can speak more English because I want to work in the place where we - which is we have to use English always.
I think speaking is the most important skill because we have to speak other people.  If we meet people, we can just - we cannot just write or something else.  We have to speak.
Yes.
But I think in the end we want to meet them in person so we have to speak---
Yes.
Yes.
