Yeah.  
Um, yes, I do.  Yeah, I'm fine with it.
Mmm, I haven't really thought about it.  Uh, I don't find any reason to not like it.  It's just a way to speak to people.  
So I'm okay with it.  
Like in recently I don't have any chances to speak English at all.
Yes.  
Um, yeah, yes, I think that we like.
I like to just talk about things, just simple conversations about things that I like.  
Yeah.  
Well, I don't really do anything nowadays.
But before I used to go to English academics - academy, and there I would speak to my teacher or my friends in English, that helped a lot.
Um, one-to-one conversation.  
Because - so, it's okay if the situations are informal but like when I'm in informal situation, especially in discussions or debating, I find it hard to speak out.  
So, I just prefer XXX  better if it's just daily conversations. 
Well, most important skill is - I think listening is the most important skill because I - I think that listening is the basics, the most basic skill.  So, if you have listened, if you can understand, you can speak and you have to develop your listening skill first.
