I do like speaking in English. 
I think it's quite interesting to speak in foreign - foreign language which not many people can speak fluently.  So I can feel superior than my peers. 
Okay. 
In a week.  I will often - I will speak in English maybe since I - since I live in not-speaking - non-speaking - non-speaking English community.  I was speaking in---
Maybe in only 2 to 3 hours per week.
Yes.
Usually with my friend, discuss - discussion group friends in English.  Maybe from fresh note or maybe even video call or maybe face-to-face - face-to-face discussion. 
I like to watch movie in English because the - the international - in the international fiction because the joke and the plot is actually talked in English.  And therefore the main stories should be -should - should be known in English - the - the - the actual information will be different than the translated ones. 
Yes. 
My speaking ability is quite horrible.
I have to - I have to practice every day-- should - should practice every day.  But I feel I don't have confident -- confidence - confidence for speaking - speaking every day because my friend and my colleague and my teacher, they are not in speaking in --
They don't speak in English. 
So far I would listen, read anything in English including web novel, graphic novel or watching any movies without subtitle in, in English language. 
Can you repeat the question? 
It - it improve both of listening and speaking ability in - in my opinion.  Because when I listen then I will, I will repeat what the - the main - the actor or actress say.  Because somehow it leave -it  left a deep impression to me like - like a quotation from some character about something like 'Hasta la Vista' or uh like ���what's in a name' or like this. 
I like group discussion better because  . 
---there are so many information coming and I can indulge in it.  And yeah, I can speak freely because focus group discussion is like an open discussion which I am entitled to speak freely in my opinion or supported by facts or not. 
The most important for in basic language is - basic language skills is writing because I think - I think it is the most hardest part.  The most basic part is writing.  If you - if you can write then you can read; if you can write, then you should be able to speak or even listen.
