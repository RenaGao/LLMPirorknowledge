Okay.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
I enjoy teaching kids and um, okay elementary school and junior high school.
Uhm, about maybe on average anywhere from 18 to 20 lessons a week.
Mainly the listening and speaking portion of the text books that the schools are using.
I teach in a pretty - the same area that where - a downtown area.  So  
Um, from anywhere from first graders, elementary up to the junior high school third graders.
Uh, no.
It was my dream to come to Japan and I will do anything to stay here in Japan.
They should um, there should be more repetition, more practice and the problem with the text books they are using is so focused on grammar and vocabulary, it doesn't focus so much on getting them to speak the natural English.  So if they can just focus more on getting them to speak outside the textbook and especially using the ALTs or the language native teachers to - for those activities.  However, the grammar they are teaching in school is targeted for high school so they don't um, it's - it's just mandatory for them to study, not change the system and focusing on too much speaking is not going to help them, you know, get into a good high school.
In Japan, group discussions are much more um, especially up to junior high school um, works a lot better because of just the culture itself doesn't - they are used to like functioning in groups, not in a one-on-one where they are put on a spot.  They like to use the same opinions, and agree on the same things.  And choosing something different will be like outside the norm that they live in.
I can choose only one?
Okay, listening um, first, and then next speaking.
Um, listening is the input phase and the production phase would be speaking so it's just reproducing what they are learning.  So everything starts from listening.
