Sure.
Uh, it depends on the situation.
I like it when there a situation or context that - uh, in where, uh, I have to speak English then I like to speak English, so that I don't feel, uh you know degraded that I can't speak English among people  who are--- speaking.
Why do I like it?  I like it, um, the stigma attached to it that the people who speak English are educated.
In a week, um, I don't speak English much.
Yes during---
If I speak in home?
Uh, uh, I would speak with my sister.  She - she likes to talk about, uh, political issues.
So, we discuss.
Um, yes.
Um, especially, I would like to talk about arts and film, cinema.
Um, I watch movies and shows without subtitles.
Because in order to speak, you need to first listen carefully so that whatever you listen, you use that in your conversation later on, there are more chances that your memories allows you to the - use those vocabularies that you have heard in that.
Yes.
One-to-one.  I don't like---
Because in - mostly in group discussions, uh, I feel that I'm being dominated by someone.
So, I avoid group discussion.  I prefer one-to-one face-to-face conversation with only one person---
Yes.
Um, I think speaking.
Um, it's because you speak a lot and - a lot and usually more than you write so you should more focus on speaking.
