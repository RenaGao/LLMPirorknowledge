Yes.
Okay. 
Mmm, actually I don't like speak English because when I was third or first grade, or when I was in school, I go to an English training and they tell me you don't have to - you don't have to make a mistake.
And you have to repeat XXX  about 300 times a day.
So I feel so stressful to speak English.
Mmm, I think one or two times when I have English class.
Yeah.
Uh, yes, yes.
Mm, about my daily life because in my English class, clearly we are talk about my everyday situation then while I often do something, so I feel very exciting about this.
Mmm, I think I do not learn speaking English totally but, mm, in English class, I - I can learn speaking English naturally.
Yeah.
One-to-one group.
I think group discussion is better to speak English.
Because I can learn vocabulary, which I don't know but my friends know and my friends use.
So, I can learn that situation.
Mmm, I think listening is the most important skill because listening is the basic and fundamental skills to learn or speak and write in English.
