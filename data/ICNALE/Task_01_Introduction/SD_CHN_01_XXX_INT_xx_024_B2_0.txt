Uh, please.
Well, I do.
You - you mean why I like speak English?
Well, it is a very, you know, very common language throughout the world, and well, as a matter of fact, I like the pronunciation of English.  I think it's beautiful and - and longing for speaking it very fluently.
Well, how often?  I think it's maybe once a week because my seminar is in English.
Yeah, of course, I do. .
Well, maybe my hobby.
Well, I like workout actually, like in gym.  Workout in gym.
Yeah.
It's - yeah, I think it's my only hobby.
Maybe, um, watching some telly - like - like drama.
You mean watching drama?
Oh yeah, speaking - well, you know because you do not have some language partners, so I have to, like, speak to myself.
Yeah.
I can do that.
Well, I like the latter, the group speaking.
Because, um, it gives me some time of thinking.  I do not have to have, like, to answer the question in a very short time.
Maybe I can, like, think it over while some other people speaking.
The most important skill, I think, it's maybe speaking.
I think it's very important part of communication.  Like, in - well, also I think it's the most convenient one.
Because, um, when you - like, communicate with someone else, it takes a lot of time for you to - to write and, well, speaking is the more convenient one.
