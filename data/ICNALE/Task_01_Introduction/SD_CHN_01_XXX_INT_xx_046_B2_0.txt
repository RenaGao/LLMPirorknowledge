Yes.
Mmm, absolutely yes, because I like many English movies.  So, I enjoy speaking English, uh, just because I watch these movies and I want to - uh, to repeat the - mm, the lines I like.
And to be honest I seldom have chances to speak English in our daily life cause - because, you know, uh, some - my friends around me always speak Chinese.  Uh, so we have - we don't have to speak English.
Yes, I - you know, uh, I want to - I want to, um--- 
Yes, so I need to, um, increase my ability to speak English.
Definitely about - uh, talk about - talking about my favorite star - stars, like - uh, like the - like the singers and Ara - Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift.
Mmm, um, firstly I want to, uh, have some chances to talk about more foreigners.  Uh, talking with them is the best way to improve my oral speak - oral English - oral ability.  So, I think it's a most eff - effective way.
Yes.
Yes, because you can - you can get used to the accent, uh, you have the - you have the, uh, sense of speaking English.  So, you can, uh, speak it easily.
Mmm, I - I prefer the letter.
Yes.
Because I think one to one speaking is sometimes make me feel nervous, because I know my oral speaking - oral ability is not as good as foreigners, so it make - make me feel very tense.
Mmm, actually I think both, uh - all of these abilities are important, but most important must be speaking, because if you learn, uh, English you just - you can only, uh, write, uh, listen or - or just some - something else.  You can't speak with others, uh, just nothing.
Yes.
