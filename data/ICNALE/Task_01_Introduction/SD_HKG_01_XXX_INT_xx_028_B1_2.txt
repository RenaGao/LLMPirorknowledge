Sure.
Uh, kind of.
Because, uh, some of my friends they are studying in the United States or elsewhere like European countries and then also, uh, I grew up watching quite lot of English movies, so I am kinda interested in speaking in English.
Well, uh, mostly during class time for now, but when I was little I used to speak in English like every day because the school requires us to speak in English.
Uh, yeah, kind of, because, well, we don't have much chances to speak in English nowadays.
Um, mm, depends on who I am talking to, yeah, because.
Hmm.
Well, uh, I just try to, um, like maybe watch some more movies and then learn their accents and then I also read more books so that I know how not to make too much grammatical mistakes.
Um, I actually prefer one-to-one speaking because, uh, group di - in group discussions there are often people that dominates the, uh, conversation too much and then what they are talking about might not be interesting to me, so I prefer talking one-to-one with a friend or with someone that - that's interested in the same thing as I do.
Um, I think - uh, it's hard to decide.  Uh, speaking and listening might be more, uh, important in like social or daily life because, uh, you have to listen to some other people speaking, you have to understand them, and then you can - you have to, uh, give them a proper response to interact properly with them.  But then, uh, sometimes, uh, reading might also be important because nowadays we all just use our phones and text message each other, so, yeah, reading and writing can also be quite important.
