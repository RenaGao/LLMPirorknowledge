Okay, sure.
Ah - I - not really, but I can - I keep learning to speak in English.  Sometime yes, sometimes I am try hard to speak in English.
Because I like to learn a new vocab, and also I - I need more new experience to talk in English.
Very rarely actually because I - I speak in my own language country, but in some event, I must talk in English.
With my lecturer, with my friends if I need, and with strangers sometimes.
I use - usually like asking - ah - the experience or the - the - what you call that - the - the example or something - or the opinion on something - some topic or in studies.
Actually yes, if I can, but I am a little bit shy or not confident to talk in English because I - lack of practice and confident.
Maybe some story or knowledge in biology or also experience in future or history maybe.
I mean - if to improve the English, we should read a lot of article or journal maybe, some magazine, newspaper or website, or try to talk - I can try to talk with some people that I am close to - to - and that my embarrassment and also shy and confident to talk with them.  And also maybe the - I can use frequently to talk in English with my close friend or family members.
Actually I like group discussion more because many idea can come at one time and also we can discuss about the topic with - actually in the group, can - we can discuss the topic in the long time.  So between one and one, we only have a few ideas, and in group discussion, there are lot of - there are lot of times.
Actually I think speak - speak is more important because - yeah we listening what people say and also we - we need the confident to speak the English to the others, so they - they can get - get a correct information with our speak.
