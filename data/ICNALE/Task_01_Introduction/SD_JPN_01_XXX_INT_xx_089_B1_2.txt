 Yes.
 Umm, umm because, uh, when I speak English, I feel XXX  .
 No, nothing.
 Uhm, yes.
 Uh, I like mass media so I want to talk about mass media in English.
 Uhm, for example, uh I, I, I am interested uh in uh buyers in newspaper, so uh I think it is uh I think it is uh different by country so, uh, I want to speak about it.
 So speaking in English is not necessarily easy for many people, so in your case, what do you usually do to develop your speaking ability?
 Now, uh, I am busy so I, eh, I am doing nothing but.
 If I have chance, I, I will do, uhm, speak in, in English.   For example, when I study English hard, I often do shadowing, shadowing using text book.
 I like uh um, I, I think group discussion is better.
 Oh yeah.
 Because I am shy so, uh, if I feel stressed, uh, I can speak well - but - so conversation is - a little nervous for me.  But a group discussion, uh, is, uh, in group discussion there are many people, so I, I can, I can just, just listen.
 Uh, but in conversation, I have to speak.
 Hmm, I think it is depend --- it is dependent on   individual.
 Uhm, I think, uh, reading is the most important skill.
 Uhm, ah.  Uhm, for me, I will, I will enter graduate school so I have to read many papers in English.
 So, uh, I need reading English but, umm, speaking is umm.
