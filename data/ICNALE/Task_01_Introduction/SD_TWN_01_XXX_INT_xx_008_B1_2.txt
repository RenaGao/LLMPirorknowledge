Okay.
Hmm I like speaking in English, but I think speak English is, um, little bit scare for me because I - um, I don't have, um, many experience to speak English to other people.
Hmm   how often?
I think most of time it's the - the---  
In the class, um, every class I - I attempt to speak English because that's the only time I can use English.
Um, with my classmate and with TA and when - when we do some, uh, discussion.
What kind of topics?  Um, uh, they prefer to, uh, the class, uh, the topic of the - uh, of this class.
Like - um, like love and marriage or some, uh, different culture.
Um, I think it is good if I can have more chance to speak English because, um, only if I use English, uh, I can improve my English.
Uh, I think it is some communication in life, daily life.
Like - like, uh, order some food or, um - or talk to foreign people like if they want to find some - some, um, location or and they have some difficulty when they come to Taiwan.
Um, I will try to, um, when - when - when I use English to communicate I will first think it in my brain or I written - written to the eye looks some YouTube or some - some, um, YouTube video like gaming or travelling and I try to - I try to - um, I try to learn - uh, learn the way they say English.
Uh, I think group discussion because in group discussion we can, um, many people are in the communication who can learn and main - um, more way to they talk English.
I think it is speaking.  
Because speaking ability is, uh, the - the - the usual way we use English.
