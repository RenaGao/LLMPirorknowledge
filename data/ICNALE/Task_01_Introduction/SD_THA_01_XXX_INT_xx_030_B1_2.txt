Yes, I really like speaking English.  I always speak with myself at - when I am at dorm.
I think it's, uh, um - I think English is - it's - it's beautiful - Thai is so beautiful to like I love English, I love - it just loves speaking English.
In a week, um, maybe, uh, five - five days a week.
In - in general topic with my friends and, uh, when - uh, as I have said, when I am at dorm, I speak with myself too.
Yes, in - I have attended the oral speaking class, but you know, the - the two - two class, I have attended the oral one, oral two, we studied in almost in a book and we had, you know, few chances to speak English.
Uh, general topic with food, my habits, or maybe, uh, okay pop songs, generally like that.
I - I always talk with myself.  I always think of any topic or maybe any questions and then I pretend that I am, uh, the interviewer and interviewee and then answer my own questions and sometimes I watch, uh, English videos, English movies too.
Yes, yes.  Um, I think watching videos, English videos is a efficient way, uh, practicing speaking English because I - every time that I finished watching English videos, I could speak it - I can speak English more fluently and--- 
---write after watching the English video.  I think I just watch the - the accent, the way they speak, and then I can speak a little bit better after watching the video.
I like group discussion because, uh, the more people I talk with, uh, the more vocabularies and new vocabularies I can get and I can get a lot of opinions from other people to like versus idioms.
Uh, the most important skill, I think - I have to choose only between--- 
Um, speaking.
Uh, when we communicate, I think speaking is the most important we can speak.  When we speak, we can - we - we listen to each - to - to our partner that we speaking - we are speaking with too, so.
Yes.
