Of course.
Yes.
Uh, because I can practice my English and I like social.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How often?
Well, um, I try my best to speak English very often.  But actually, um, about fourth a week.
Yeah, yeah.
With my may - maybe my roommates. 
Or classmates.
Yeah.
Huh, when I need to, um, explain something that cannot use Chinese.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, sometimes gossip.
Yeah.  Or like, um, professor's home works.  Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.  If I have this kind of chance I - I want to.  Yeah.
Oh, recently, I would like to speak, uh, about economic.
Yeah.
Because I think it's very important to know that, um, what's going on in the world---
---especially the ec - economic issue.  Yeah, because it's kind of - you don't even know how to, um, maybe somehow you need to take a trip to other countries, and then you think that, oh, maybe 10,000 is enough to buy something.  But actually it's not enough actually.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I think, um, like my professor says, uh, um, we need to understand what other is talking about.
And listen - listen is the most important thing I - I think.  So, um, I can listen then I will comprehend it then speak it, and speak - speak out to express my.
Uh, force myself to speak English with my roommates, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah but sometimes she - she will speak Chinese to reply me.  Yeah.
Yeah.
I like group discussion better.
Yeah, because---
---I - I like to listen to other's opinion then, um, to come back with my opinion and give out the most, um, specific or most important opinion to others.
Listening.
Because if you don't understand that what others speaking about - talking about, you would not say anything.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
