Good morning.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Hmm.
Uh, not that really much.  But I am trying to speak in English as much that I can. 
Uh-huh.
I am sorry?
Hmm, for the first time, it's because uh, in the my faculty actually almost all the lecturers try to speaking in English.  So and also all of my friends try to start to speak in English also, so yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
In a week?
Uh, I'm speaking in English uh, with my boyfriend, it's like a whole day.  So, like every day I am using in English.  But in, in my, in my, in my campus maybe like 2 or 3 hours.
Sorry.
In total?
Uhm, 5, 4, 4 and 5.
Per day.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh, almost it's like a daily life.  But when it's starting university things, we - we talk about the studies or something.
Uh, like what?
Almost everything.
Everything, especially for the important things, because uh, I have a gap, age gap with my boyfriend.  So I'll try to use it in English to reduce the gap.
I try to speak as much that I can.  Try to reading the English book.  And whenever I am watching the movie or something I am like, you know, I like uh, watching the variety show of the Korea.  And I almost using the English subtitle or then the Bahasa subtitle.
I would like to one by one.
Uh, I thought this because it's - it's easier rather than in the groups.
In my case, it's the writing skill, because my job is about the writing something, so yeah.
