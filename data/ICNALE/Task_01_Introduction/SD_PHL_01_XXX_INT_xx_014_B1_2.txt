Yes.
Ah, I really don't.
Ah, first ah, it, it's difficult for me to have words to put into because ah, I'm good at writing English words.  But speaking in English, a little difficult for me.
Hmm, I speak English during the ah, English subjects requiring for speaking in English and some of my subjects ah, some profs speak in English.  So, we, I, I should speak in English too when talking to them or reciting.  And whenever I talk to my, a foreigner, some foreign students, I should also talk with them for me, for us to understand each other.
Yes.
For me ah, ah, especially maybe with topics like life of, of course, living space, history and geography especially here in the Philippines or ah, in Asia.
Ah, I always talk with some of my friends in English so that I can practice myself speaking in English too and my sister is fluent in English.  So, I always tell her to practice speaking in English every day.  My cousin is from the United States.  I always talk to him in Skype or in Facebook messenger.  And also my other relatives live in other parts in the world.
Maybe a lot more in conversation.
Because I feel it's, I can practice myself in speaking in English and it's also in private.
Ah, for me, it's, for me, it's writing, because ah, people can communicate freely in speaking.  And ah, by writing or typing, you can speak.  It's like you are speaking in English too even if you are not good at speaking it, but very good in writing it.
