Uh, I like speaking English.
Uh, because I think it is a challenging task as my mother tongue is Cantonese and is a difficult or challenging task for me to speak English to for - foreigners or to strangers.
Um, maybe I think I speak English during classes, especially for English classes or I speak English so my, uh, uh, friends or to my brother.
Uh, we usually talk about, uh, our interest - interest of topics and, uh, uh, the - the stuffs that we need to discuss, uh, during classes in English - English lessons.
Uh, I would like to speak more English as I think, uh, you know, international world, uh, we should learn to speak fluently when we talk to others.
