Oh, thank you.
Yes.
Yes and no.
Yeah.  Yes as is much I love teaching the children.  No is in as much as sometimes the way things are structured are a little bit machine-like, if you know what I mean.
It depends, anywhere from 5 to 10.
Well, whatever happens to be in the textbook at that time.
Young children, anywhere between the ages of 4 and 11.
Yeah, I would love to.
Well, I need to go somewhere to take it up, and I was thinking something like Myanmar or somewhere, a developing country where children will be requiring English in the future.
Well, I've only heard good reports about the place.  Of course I have to check it out myself, but yeah, it sounds fantastic.  Peaceful country and people have good values and people with good values deliver good education.
Well, of course it depends on the individual, but just like anything like visualization, stand in front of the mirror, pretend that you are an English speaker, sing in the shower if you like, don't worry particularly about grammar.  Be a child.  Let it sync in naturally.
Hmm, that's a good question.  Again, I think it comes down to the individual and that would depend on how much they have eased or open as it were to taking one of the random.  Yeah, personally for me, one on one is better because I like to - I like to have a little bit of friction.  In a group setting, I prefer to be a bit of a listener and take everything in and - and try and write it down as I go and check it up later or take with somebody else.
Oh, look I think it's anything to do with affirmations anywhere in life works well because when you've got affirmations, then the visualization comes.  So, I think speaking would be the top part to practice.
Because - because then at least a visualization.
