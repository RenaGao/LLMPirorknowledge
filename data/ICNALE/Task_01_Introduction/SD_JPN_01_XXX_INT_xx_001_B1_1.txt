 I don't like.
 Yeah.
 I can't speak English so well.
 So when I speak English, I am so feel nervous.
 I speak English at university lesson, so.
 Not so much.
 With my friend in class.
 So, I think I can speak English more better, so.
 I so, I think.
 I want to think   with the same, yeah.
 I do nothing.
 I want to speak with the foreign students.
 I think I have to listen English more.
 I like one-to-one.
 I am not good at English.
 So, if I talk with many people, I can't speak.
 I think speaking is most important.
 I learned writing and listening in my high school.
 But actually mostly, I meet foreign people.
 If I can write English, but I can't speak with the foreign people.
 So, I think most important thing is speaking with foreign people.
