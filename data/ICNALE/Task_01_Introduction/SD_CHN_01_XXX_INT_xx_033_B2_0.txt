Okay.
Uh, yes, I like.
So, you know, English is the most common language in the world and, um, if you - if you travel to another country, uh, there - there is a great possibility that you will meet a - a - a foreigner and you can use English to commu - communicate with her, so it's useful.  
Uh, how often?
From now, maybe once or twice a week.
Um, sometimes with my roommates because, um, most of them are preparing for their, um, postgraduate, uh, entrance examination, so, uh, they need to think - uh, they need to improve their English a bit, so we - we chat, use English.
Uh, of course, yes.  So, I want to study abroad to gain more chance to speak in English.
What topic, um, I prefer some topic, uh, related to our true - true life.
Daily life.
Um, for me, I like to - to watch some, uh, English movies or English TV series and - yeah.
Uh, yeah I like.
Um, uh, for me, I prefer the group discussion because I am a little shy and I - I am the kind of person who don't like confrontation.
So, uh - so if - if during a group discussion, you can - uh, if you don't have opinion, others will give their, um, supp - supplement, so the atmosphere will not be so embarrassing.
Um, most important maybe the speaking.
Um, I think speaking is the basic skill for - for a person.  Um, if you can speak very freq - fluently - fluently, um, you - it means you can - you can read - read these words, your article, or you can write them down.  So, it means you - it means you can - you can, uh - it means you have - you are very excellent English user.
Mmm.
