Yeah, sure.
Yeah, I love it.
Um, because, uh, I - I learn English since I was 3 or 4 years old, um-hmm, in private school--- 
Yes, so I love - so I love it.
Yeah, also, but, uh, in my school.
Yes.
Um, I think that's two - uh, that's twice a week.
I think that's 1 or 2 hours, maybe one hour.
Yes.
Now?  Um, um, actually I'm, um, appeared, uh, like pharmacy ambassador for foreigner, and I always, uh, bring foreigner who comes my faculty, um, travel in Hat Yai or some XXX   like this.
Um, I join, uh, like, uh, the organization for pharmacy student like a XXX   is international pharm - for pharmacy student, we work together.  So, we chat a lot and sometimes Skype.
Um, because I think it's very important for me, uh, I think if you know a lot of language, not only in English, but also in other language, it will, uh, improve - improve your life quality and, uh, enhance some opportunity but also in career path.
I just, um, brave and try to speak.
Yes.

For me, I think maybe reading.
Because, um, most of foreigners like me, I think first do, when you - when you don't understand, and you can writing - and you can write in academy, I think, uh, reading, uh, is easy to improve.  And, for example, if you - you skilled about listening, uh, the listen good, you can ask someone to write on something and you can read it.
Yeah and there are a lot of text books, so you can gain more knowledge from that.
