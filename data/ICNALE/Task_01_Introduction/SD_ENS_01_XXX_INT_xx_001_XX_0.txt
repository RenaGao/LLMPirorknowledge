Yes sir.
Yeah, yeah, I am satisfied with it.
Because I am doing it with all kind of enthusiasm and I am so happy doing it, so that makes it almost like my hobby doing it, so that's why I am really satisfied doing the job.
A week I have roughly like almost about 40 - 40 classes.
I teach any - any content that has been given to me by the company or by the school.  Now because there is no specific content I don't make up content myself.
I teach all grades from - from babies to - from toddlers to adults - I teach almost everybody.
Yeah, sure.
Are you - are you asking as in the future or---?
In the future?
Sorry, I don't - I don't think so, but I have done that before in China also.
In the future, no, I wouldn't like to continue.
Yeah.
My advice is everybody got his own different advice about that as in different way of putting people together to speak more fluently in English.  But my advice is I think people should focus on activities, games, and you know funs because through funs people can easily be happy with what they are speaking.  The language that is not originally theirs, we make it fun and they will - they will speak it very easily and they will like to speak it more and more.
Group.
Yeah, because in group, some people are scared or rather shy to make mistakes, but once they are adjust to the situation of that group, then they - they are not shy any more.  They just feel free and free to - feel free to speak, and they learn easily because they - they are free to make mistakes and they don't want others to see them as XXX   or something like that so they want to speak up.
The most important is speaking.
Yeah, because generally everybody speaks and on the phone you can make a phone call and speak, and phone call doesn't - doesn't demand writing or reading or - it demands speaking.  So speaking is more important anywhere you go.
