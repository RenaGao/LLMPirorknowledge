Of course.
Uh, yes, of course, you can speak like that because I have learned English for about like 12 years, but normally I speak in Chinese.
Uh, for now, uh, honestly, zero.
Topic, uh, because lately I normally listening English a lot, uh, because as you know the podcast - podcast, I don't know if I pronounce right, but, mm, is quite popular in students.  So, uh, I listening lots of podcast, so I would like to talk about lot of, uh, people who are doing podcast.
Yes, of course.  I think more chance can improve - I mean, uh, help me for improve my English speaking.
Uh, like I just said, I listening a lot of podcast and I watch a lot of English speaking videos, uh, and for now, I am a graduate in our university, so I, mm, read a lot of papers in English.
Uh, yes, but I would like to say that I - I prefer to talk, uh, with lots of people who, mm, how can I say that - who, uh, treat English not their first language.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mmm, yes.
Uh, I think it depends on the content you are speaking.  Uh, if you are going through a serious talking, I would like to going - uh, I mean I would like to talking with person one to one.  But if you are, you know, uh, discuss, uh, I would like to, uh, go through a group discussion.
Uh, I think for now, for my situation, I prefer to choose writing because I have to write a lot English papers.
Yeah.
