Yes.
Yes, a bit I think.
I like speaking in, in English, because many people understand it, not just Filipinos, but also other nationalities.
Maybe ah, I speak almost every day, I think.
In everyday conversations like in private messaging and Facebook.  But I rarely speak English when, when in person.  I only speak English if my, if the other person is speaking in English.
Yes.
Hmm, speaking,   anything I guess.  I just want to speak in English so that I may improve my skills in speaking it, because when I type in English, it seems okay.  It seems it's very, it's very flowy and fluent in English when I'm typing or when I'm, when I'm doing an email.  But when I am speaking, I kind of stutter, yeah.
What I do is I read, I read a lot of books in English and then, I try to speak English with my friends especially if, if they are comfortable.
Sorry, may you  
Umm, I prefer one-to-one, because it gives us a chance to listen very well and it gives us a chance to speak up, because when in a group, we, we have the, the tendency to not speak because others are speaking as well.
I may say that reading is, for me, reading is the most important part, because I believe that if you can read English, you can also understand English when you hear it.
