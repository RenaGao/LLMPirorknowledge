Sure.
Yes.
Because like every Pakistani, we have some natural instincts to speak English.  So, I do believe that, uh, English is a international language, so why should - so why shouldn't I speak English?
Well, every time when I am in university especially in front of my teachers, so I used to speak English.
Well, in home I am not used to speak English, not in my friends because I have very informal relation with my friends.  Uh, in fact, in - in my family, so, I don't speak English at home.
Well, politi - politics and uh, especially, uh - especially I would like to talk on corruption and some taboo topics like smoking and, you know, uh, gambling, card playing and etcetera.
Honestly speaking, I have made some vocabulary list.  So, I used to cram all those list and sometime I, uh, get help from my students, uh, from my, uh, buddies, who are, you know, teaching at University of Lahore, so I used to get help from all those sources.
Well, well I don't think so it helps your spoken skills, I mean, it helps to improve your language to - it - it helps to improve your flowery language when you speak in front of public, uh, in you know, XXX , so then you need to speak such a - such type of words.  So that's I believe.
Uh, by my choice, I like, uh, one-to-one conversation. 
Because so many people, uh, the - the presence of so many people, it annoys me, probably, I am a patient of xenophobia.  Uh, so I have been kidnapped during my XXX  so that from that time I - I don't like so many people on one place.
Speaking is the most important skill, uh---.
Because in every country in every region, if you can speak English, then you can survive even in Middle East, uh, a person who can speak English can find job easily.  And you know, when we speak, then we do anything.
