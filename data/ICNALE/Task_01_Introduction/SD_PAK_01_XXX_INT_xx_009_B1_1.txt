Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Uh, English as it becomes an international language and for - to survive in as our society for or to - or to achieve a good position in our society, we have to speak in English so we want to learn English.
Uh, almost 3 to 4 hours.
With my, uh, teachers in classroom or with my, um, uh, roommate in hostel.
No, I don't have more chances to speak in English. 
Yes, I want to have more chances - chances to speak in English.
I want to talk, uh, uh, on the social issues.
I want to improve, uh, my English abilities, uh, in speaking, uh, to while interacting with others
While communicating with others, while reading.
Uh, because when - when we interact with others, it - uh, it is related to our sur - surroundings and when we, uh, translate or when we try to think or talk about the things that surround us that improves our speaking abilities.
I like the most group discussion.
Because in group discussion, when someone is, uh, speaking in English and while the others is noticing, he can - he or she can highlight the mistakes or he can instruct the others that in this way, you can improve your English.
I think so for academic - for academic skills, writing skill is the most important and, uh, to get high grades or high position, then speaking skills is, uh, important.
