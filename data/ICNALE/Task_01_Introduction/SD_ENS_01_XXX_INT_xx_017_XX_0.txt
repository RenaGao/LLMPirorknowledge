Thank you too.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Because I like working in the morning.
And afternoon, I finish early, so I like it.
In a week, I teach about - it depends actually.
On average, maybe 9.
Yeah, 9 to 10.
Umm, I teach like - it's a personal teacher I work with.  So, sometimes I - I am like the main teacher, so they let me teach grammar.  But sometimes, it's just like conversation activities or---
I teach different kinds of students.  Umm, now, I am - during my last contract I taught at a very - like crowded school.  You see---
I'm sorry.  Junior high school.
Yeah, so---
From first to third.
Well, I am happy in - in Japan, so yeah maybe just in Japan.
Well, I think they should, like, be comfortable with the teacher first, so it will be easy for them to express themselves or - yeah, so I think the teachers must be, like, very, like, warm.
But it's quite difficult for Japanese because we're in Japan.
Um-hmm.
Um-hmm
One-to-one.
Because you get to - like the conversation is, like, man to man, so you ask a question, they can answer and by that they can practice more.  Because actually I think  
Okay because I think if it's a group, then - and they are Japanese, so they are like more - they could express them - themselves more in Japanese than in English.
They have a choice.
Depends on where you use English, like formalist Japanese students, especially engineering high school, they need to practice more grammar because they have to take tests.  But in like the real world, speaking is the most important.
Because you interact with people and you use - you need to use the language more rather than like - it's quite useless if you can't speak and you just know how to write and read.
