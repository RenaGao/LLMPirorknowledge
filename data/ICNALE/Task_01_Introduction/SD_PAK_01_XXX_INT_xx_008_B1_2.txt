Yes, you can ask me.
Yes, I do.
Uh, because I have been speak - uh, uh, studying English for a very long time and I have liked conversing with other peoples in English---
---for no good reason.
I speak a lot in English actually.
With my brothers and sisters.
Uh, at home.
We talk about, uh, daily things.
Yes, I would like to speak more English.
Mostly, I would like to talk about academic topics because I don't talk much.
And academic topics engage most of the students in spoken activities so---
Well, to improve my speaking ability, I normally, uh, listen a lot to the BBC radio on YouTube and a lot of English dramas, I have listened and I have seen.
Well, uh, listening actually provides us with a lot of vocabulary and the way English people speak so that becomes a part of our consciousness and that's why, I think it is the better way to communicate or speak English.
I like one to one conversation the most.
Because it provides more chances to engage and answer, uh, your - and provide your opinion openly.
Uh, reading is the most important skill according to me because without reading, we cannot improve our writing, we cannot, uh, adopt new vocabulary items in speaking and we cannot, uh - uh, you know, enter or add new, uh, items of syntax in our language.
