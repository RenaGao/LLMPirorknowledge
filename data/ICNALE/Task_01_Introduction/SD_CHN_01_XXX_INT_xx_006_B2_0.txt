Uh, yes, but rather than like speaking in English, uh, I have to say I have to speak in English.
In 1 week, I think, uh, since last year, I came - came to Japan, uh, the frequency just tends, uh, to be much more than - that it used to be.

Maybe, the hobbies and - because I really like the, uh, documentaries about animals, maybe I want some - some people have the common interest with me.
Uh, to develop my speaking ability, I usually - I like to watch the TV serials like The Big Bang Theory and also some Hindi movies, and I just told you before and - and I - I like - I like to watch the documentaries of animals.

The most important one is, uh, you have to let other people knows about what you are thinking about.
