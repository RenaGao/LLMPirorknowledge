Uh, okay.
Uh, I - uh, no I can't.
I don't like speak English, uh, because English is not my, uh, nation, uh, language.
I think, uh, speak Chinese is more, uh, a better chance for me.
Um, in fact, uh, I don't speak English in the adult - uh, in adult life.
Uh, when I take classes, uh, I will speak English, uh.
Okay.
Uh, I - um, in fact, I don't want more chance to speak English.
Uh, because I don't like speak English.
I think the speak - speak English is, uh, difficult for me.
Um, I think to improve my speak English skills, uh, I will, uh, speak more, uh, English---

For example, I will communicate with my friends, all my, uh, stu - uh, all my student---
Uh, classmates, 
Uh, classmates, all my classmates, uh, in English.

Uh, I prefer - uh, I prefer, uh, group conversation.
And I think I can learn from each other's.
And this is a conversation and I can, uh, speak to each other and, um - and I can improve more easily.
Um, in fact, I think as a Chinese students, writing is more important---
---because many - uh, because many, uh, exams, uh, uh, many exams, uh, think the writing is more important, but in fact, uh, in my eyes, I think, uh, listening and, uh, speaking is more important because, uh, the English is to - is used to - uh, is useful to communicate - uh, communi - uh, communicate with each other.
Uh, so the speak and listening is more important.
