It's fun teaching the children and seeing them grow and - you have a part in seeing them grow and you help them to learn something.
I only - I only teach on Saturdays.
I teach elementary school level.  We teach English in a - we teach everything, so science, history, maths, and English.
Elementary school.
Currently, I am teaching grade 3.
I don't know.
Yeah, sure.  My job is actually programming.
So I - that's why I only teach on Saturdays.
The main thing is practicing everyday I think and having more natural conversations.
I think group conversations where everyone can join in and interact with each other is better.  But if the child is less confident, then the one-on-one will help the teacher, so it depends on the child's personality I think.
So English learners, the most practical is speaking and listening  .
Because of how we interact with - with each other, day to day.  And most of the time we don't - we don't - although we send a lot of messages, in terms of business and future wise speaking and listening is the most important.
