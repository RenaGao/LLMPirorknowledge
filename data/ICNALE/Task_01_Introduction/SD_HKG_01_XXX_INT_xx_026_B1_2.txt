Yes, of course.
Hmm, yes.
Um, because, eh, speaking in another language makes me, eh, to have another, uh, mindsets that, uh, different from, uh, speaking in Cantonese.
Um, I speak in English most in - in campus, in during my university life and also in - several friends outside the campus, such as some, uh, social networking events in - that - in outside of the campus.
Yes, indeed.
Um, it depends on what, um, what situation in, for example, uh, for me and I want to speak English more in maybe in making new friends that - yeah - yeah, English native speaker and also in - in my webpage in the future, I also hope that have a chance to speak English more.
Yes.
Um, to improve English speaking that I will, uh, try to and to, um - listen to more, uh, uh, responses that are produced by English speaker, for example, there are ABC, BBC, that all the documentaries and also even TED Talks that, uh, led by authentic English native speaker that help me - help me to - to improve my, uh, English especially in the oral aspect.
Um, I think in, uh, one-on-one conversation is better because there, uh, you fully, uh, respond and also focus on listening what the other is, uh, speaking, rather than group conversation because in a group conversation there are always, uh, happen that maybe always one or two, um, people in that conversation, that are just listener and seldom speak.  But in a one-on-one conversation that I can fully respond and also listen to what other say.
Yes.
Uh-hmm.
Most important, let me think.  And I think speaking is the most important because it's the - the fundamental, uh, step for - to - to have conversation or to communicate with others.  So, for language I think speaking is the most important and also the crucial part of - um, in English rather than others.  And I mean others, uh - others is also important but speaking is the most crucial part.
