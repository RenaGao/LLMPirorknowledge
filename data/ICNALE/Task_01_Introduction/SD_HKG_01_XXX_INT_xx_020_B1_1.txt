Okay.
Um, I think I like speaking English.
Um, because I think English is an another, eh, language that, uh, that I can say because my mother tongue is, uh, Cantonese and I am enjoy to speak in a more language.
I think maybe, in the university, I think I may speak more often and maybe three times or four times per week.
Uh, when I speaking English I - mostly I will talk to the professor and I have question in some of the lectures.  And also sometimes when they - when the class has some exchange and I have, um, communicate with them then I will also speak in English.
Um, yes, because I think, um, um, in Hong Kong, people are less likely to speak in English nowadays and therefore we should have more chance to speaking English.
Um, I usually, um - sometimes I will read some English books and listen to some English songs to improve my English.  And also, um, I will, uh, read some magazines that, uh, English for example the CNN or English Corner.
Yes.
Um, I like one-to-one discussion better because, uh, I am quite scared to - afraid of, uh, meeting many people.
When speaking English because I think my English is, uh, not very good.
Uh, can I say all of them are important?
Um, because, uh, I think in English you have, uh, these four categories and for example like Chinese, they also have and therefore I think when we communicate with others, uh, in two - uh, in everyday and we also need to use this for things.
Okay.
