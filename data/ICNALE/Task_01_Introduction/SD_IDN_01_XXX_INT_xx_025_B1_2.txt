Yes.  I like talk a lot in English.
Because I think I can express more what I feel.
And I can explain what can I - what I cannot explain in Indonesian.
Yes.
Please.
Ah, I think in a day I talk 1 and until 2 hours with my friend.
In a week I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sometimes I talk with my uh lecturer and my - my parent but it's not uh, more often than with my friend.
When I talk about something more like scientific thing and sometimes about casual thing.
Sometimes it's about I am in a pharmacy then I talk about pharmacy thing and then I talk about hmm political, social, economy, about that.
I think when I talk with English, people will know my what I think, what I want to say, and I can talk more than when I talk with Indonesian.
Sometimes I learning   English song and then I try to watch movie in English with the subtitle and then I try to watch a video how to speak English fluently.
Because I think when I watch movie I like that movie and then that's make me want to learn more and then I enjoy to learn English with watching movie and then I can - I can think and I can know it and then I can applicate   with in - in a life.
Sometimes I try to imitate what the actor said and then when I don't know what it is meaning I try to search it and I try to listen it what does it say, something like that.
I think I like to talk in a group discussion and---
Because when I make a mistake someone can - someone can what is that.
Yeah someone.  
Yeah, someone can fix what my mistakes is, something like that.
I think the most important one is writing because with writing someone can express, someone can explain what they can - what they want to tell to people and I think I - I enjoy more in writing than speaking.  
Yeah something like that.
