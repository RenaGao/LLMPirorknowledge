Yes, please.
I do.
Umm, for me umm, it became my everyday use for language.  For example, in school I always speak in English because it is required and most of my friends speak in English.
Mostly my - with my close friends and my classmates usually.
Especially when there are no classes to attend - umm, my friends and I are always tend to going - umm, coffee shop or in library and there we're going to talk about something that is related to ourselves like umm, if we're fond of poetry, we're talking about poetry with the use of English.
Of course.
Umm, my friends and I are really fascinated about literature, especially umm, filming literature and of course the literature from west - of course, popular literature and if we are about to talk about something that is fund and we are related about, we're going to talk about the - the literature in a English way.
For me, being a person that is not really into talking, umm, I tend to practice more in writing umm, by of course in writing - in practicing writing you have to read of course to gain lenalidomide, to gain more vocabulary and while after that you have to execute it to writing and of course after writing you have to share the issue of speaking.
I like the one-on-one discussion more than the group discussion.
For the reason - umm, there is an intimacy between the - the two because in - if it's in group discussion there is what you call a proximity that you have to be my - you're not allowed to speak if the - if the speaker is speaking.  But if you're - if you're in a one-to-one discussion you're allowed to share thoughts with each other and there you have the - you will find an intimacy about it.
For me the most difficult to acquire is listening because listening has to something with umm, gaining knowledge and for you to - umm, execute in - to execute how to speak, the how to write you have to first learn how to listen very, very proficient.
