Yeah.
Um, yes, I like but sometimes I am afraid of speaking English.
Because I think my English speaking ability is not that good.
Uh, maybe, once a week.
Mm-hmm.  Sometimes I'll talk my sister.
But I usually speak English in English class.
Um, meaning when I speak in English with my sister?
Um, because she is preparing for TOEFL exam.  So, she need - she needs a person to practice English with her.
Uh, just like daily chatting.
Everything.
Like, uh, what happened recently or what do I feel about something.
Yes, I want.
Um, about movie or music.
Um, I try to not to be afraid of speaking English.  So, I usually speak English at home with my sister because I think maybe I speak English outside make - make some mistakes.
I like one-to-one better.
Because, uh, I don't like to speak in group discussion.
Um, because I think sometimes my ideas are not that good.
I don't know whether if I speak it's a good idea or not.
Only choose one.
I think speaking is the most important because, uh, learning a foreign language is I think in my opinion is used to communicate with a foreigner.  So, I think speaking is the most important.
