Of course.
Yes.
Um, because, uh, speaking in English can make me a little happy.  I don't know why, but - but I love languages.
Uh, um, almost every day.
Uh, my foreign friends---
---and also I speak to myself.
Yes, of course, I want to practice my English.
Uh, uh, I don't know.  I think everything's fine.  But I want to talk - talk more about Chinese culture and, uh, foreign cultures, I think.
Uh, when I walk - when I walk in the street, I always speak to myself.  And - and also I will to read some books to improve my accent.
And also try to find some foreign friends to practice.
Uh, yes, actually I am.
Sometimes, because sometimes I think my accent is not very good and what makes me a little upset.

---because, uh, if - if I - if I speak in a group---
---maybe I won't speak something.
Yes.
Uh, I think speaking is the most important one---
---because language - languages always need you to communicate with each others, not just to read some books---
