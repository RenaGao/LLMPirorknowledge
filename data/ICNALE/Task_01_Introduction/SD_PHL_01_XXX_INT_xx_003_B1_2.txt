Uh, yeah a little bit.
Um, because of course everyone could understand me since it is the mother uh, language that everyone knows.
I often speak in English.  I just usually speak in English in my classes and also in my OJT.
Uh yes, of course.
I just want the casual talks like for example, about my life, sharing my experiences and my knowledge to other people.
Uh, honestly, I really watch videos in the YouTube, most specially the uh, the YouTubers from other countries so that I would be able to adapt their way of speaking and also learn some vocabularies from them.
I - I prefer the group discussion.
So that I would be able to interact with other people, with many people.
