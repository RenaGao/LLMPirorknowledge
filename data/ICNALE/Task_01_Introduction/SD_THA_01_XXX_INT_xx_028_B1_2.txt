A week, uh, about three or four days a week with my friends.
Uh, in class too.
General topic, because, uh, we want to encourage ourself to practice speaking as much as we can, so that we want to speak it slowly.
Um, no.
Yeah, I - I like writing.
Uh, I am quite a shy person and I don't talk often, only if I am friends, so I don't practically talk much.
Oh, I like, uh, imitating, uh, the sentences quote from movies and singers.  XXX   and I repeat it and I - it's automatically memorize it.
Uh, group discussions because I can hear, uh, various opinions from different people.
Um, for me, I think it's writing.
Well, um, I prefer communication in text I think.
Yeah, yes - and in writing, I can have time to think of what I really want to express or say so that, uh, the communication will be successfully.
