Yes.
Because it can give me more chance to get a job if I get a higher score if I can speak fluently.  I can get a job easily.
Actually, I don't have the chance to speak English with others.
Because people around me often speak, uh, Chinese or Cantonese or Japanese.  Most of them don't like Japanese - don't like speak in English.
Of course.
I want to talk about business.
And some culture communication, some - something about technology - technology, innovation, information.
Some - something - something else.
Actually, in my opinion, English is just communication tool for you to get to know others from, uh, English culture and English speaking country.  To know them more, you need learn English well.  So, actually, I improve my English to - to pass the exam.  Then, I love learn English---
Then I become good at it.
Actually, no.
I just push myself hard and then I XXX  because I come from a poor area in Canton which have no good English teacher.  I have - only have own - have to learn by myself.
That's all I have.
Both of them.
Yes.
One person's speech can give you more space to - to - to - to speak what you want to - want to talk and want to express, and if you in a group, you can also learn from others - learn from others, uh, opinion, their ideas, and can open your horizon if you communicate with others.
If you only speak by yourself, then sometimes you will get - your - your - your idea will narrow - will become narrow and because if only speak for yourself.  Because one person's idea is different.
Speaking and listening.
Maybe, the most important thing is speaking.
If you cannot speak, others cannot understand you quite very - you know, very successfully. 
If they cannot get the idea you want to express, then you cannot communicate.
