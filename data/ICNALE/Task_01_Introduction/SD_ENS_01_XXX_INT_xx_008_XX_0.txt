Alright.
Okay, thanks.
Okay.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh, I mean I like the challenges of creating like original material and being able to do something different every day.
A week on average, I would say 9.
Uh, content, it will be a mix of levels, so mixing with kids, mostly phonics with adults.   It's situational things and simulations and with high school students, it's grammar.
Ah students, the age ranges are between 3 and 83, so that's really a wide range. - Uh, public school mostly and I would say high school students make up about 70% adolescents.
Hmm, probably not.
Uh, relocating will be a problem and yeah just relocating is the main thing.
Uh, for teachers, for the Japanese teachers?
Uh, for students to improve their fluency, I would say, uh, practice with material that's meaningful.  To them, if they can review and practice more frequently.  And for fluency I would say just practicing, listening to like with maybe movies and pop culture things, just something that they are - it's not a chore  
Not a grind.
Uh, group discussion will be better.
Uh, let me see, to kind of play off with off other people, like naturally off-the-cuff, and to kind of challenge yourself and to see against other people's progress 
Uh, I would say speaking is most the important.
Uh, that would be because it's you are developing your own skills and cementing the vocabulary that you have, uh, kind of practicing, using its strength and using it.
Oh, tasks.
