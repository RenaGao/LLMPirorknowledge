Okay.
Yes, I like speaking in English.
Because I think that English is really important to my life and - and important to my future.
Yeah.
Maybe two or three days in a week.
Maybe with my friends or my family maybe when---
Where I usually speak English--- 
That most of that maybe in--- 
---in out of the class maybe because in my class still in Indonesia.
Yes.
Maybe but not every day and every time.
Maybe I like entertainment and reality show or movie.
Pardon me!  Can you explain?
Yeah, sure.  Yeah, sure.
Maybe in - maybe in social media.
Yeah, social media and maybe just in social media only.
Oh yeah, travelling, yes, because I like travelling.
Maybe English or German?
Yes.  Singapore.
Yes, yeah.
Okay, I usually improve my English from music - from I listen music.  Maybe when I being a fans of a singer or of a celebrity maybe and then the last maybe, I will like to watch a channel from YouTube and - and there is from - there is content of English.  So maybe I can improve my English from that.
Maybe so far I feel that maybe group discussion because I think if we are in group discussion, we can improve our topic.  But if one-of-one maybe, we just stuck in one topic.
The most important skill maybe I think that listening - listening is the most important from the writing, reading, and  
---speaking.
Because if we cannot listening properly, we cannot speaking and we - we can loss of - we can loss of the topic.  So we can - we cannot replay the - the - the - response.  Sorry, we can give a right feedback.
