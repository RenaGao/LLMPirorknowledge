Okay, sure.
Um, a little bit.
Because it - it's not usually common using in my daily life.
Um, it depends on where I'm in and - and, uh, in other country, I may speak English a lot, but in Taiwan, no, I don't speak English.
For example, like to the US or Japan---  
English is very helpful.
Yes.
Hmm, most of the time I speak English with others is, it's related to when I'm shopping or buying something, because you need to - just, uh, when you are buying something or XXX   with someone else.
Yes.
In Japan, it's usually, because Japanese English is not very well, but sometimes, well, I don't know the Japanese, what I am going to say, I will try to use English, because sometimes their language is, part of their language is from English.
Of course.
Um, the topic I like to talk about is like some kind of sports or something I'm interested in, volleyball or yes, volleyball.
To improve speaking - English speaking ability, I think it's when you are studying English, you can read it aloud.
Even if you are studying yourself and also when - and if any words that you don't how to speak, pronounce it, you can check your dictionary and try to figure it out.
Um, I prefer a group discussion.
Because I think group discussion, I can - usually it has a main topic and I can figure it with some main ideas, but with one-to-one, this one-to-one talk, usually it's just like a chat or something else.
I think writing is the most important, because writing is the way that can transfer to each, because when you have a computer, you can - if you can write - have ability to write it, the computer can transfer it to the speaking or even to for others to XXX  .
