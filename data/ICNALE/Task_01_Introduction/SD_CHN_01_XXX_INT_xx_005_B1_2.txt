Umm, uh, because I have no foreigner, uh, friends so I, uh, didn't have the English speaking environment, so, uh, but, uh, if I have the, uh, opportunities, I'd like to speak English.
In 1 week?
Umm, once or twice because in the Kobe University, we sometimes will meet some foreigners and they will ask - ask me some questions, so I will response in English but, um, in - uh, almost the, uh, situations we use Japanese.
Yes, of course.
Umm, first, from the single list topics, uh, such as food, uh, the, uh, interest and music, movies and, uh, if - uh, the higher level is the, uh, academic.
Yes, of course.
Usually do, I, uh - listening music is the, uh, funniest way - funniest way to - the easiest way to know English and, uh, watching the English movies and make it us so and the - uh, I will remember the English words, uh, that it's - uh, it's a little bit foreign for me.
Uh, group.
Uh, group.
I prefer group because, uh, there must be many different people from different cultures, so I can, uh, observe new, uh, new acknowledges from them but if one-to-one, if we have no top - topic to talk, uh, that might be embarrassing.
Important, um, for me, it's, uh, maybe in my academic life, it's writing because I have to write the, uh, academic - academic English paper but in the daily life it's speaking, it's must speaking, it must be speaking so---
Uh, because you have to communicate with others.
You, uh, talk English that they don't know what you are talking that might be trouble - big trouble but listening is also difficult because if you, uh, do not understand what they are talking, you can't response to their questions.
So, uh, actually the four, the fourth is, uh, all the import - all important I think.
