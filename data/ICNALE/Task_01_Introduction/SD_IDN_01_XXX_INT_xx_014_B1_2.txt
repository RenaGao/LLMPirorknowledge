Yes.
Yes.
It's interesting for me because my mother language, my mother tongue is Indonesian.  So, learn English is fun.
Ah, once maybe.
Ah, not more than 1 hour.
I usually talk in English if I met a person from the abroad, so they - they - they don't know Indonesian.  So, I have to talk with them with English.
No.
Ah, for travelling abroad maybe just once a year, so it's not often for me to speak English.
Yes 
Oh, for me I just listening music and watch a movie with the subtitle so I can learn from that.
Yes.
Yes.
Because - because I think when you are watching a movie, it's fun, you can have the movie and you get the English I think.
Yes.
Ah, it's - it's - it's better for the conversation because if discussion, maybe we - we have to understand people thinking but if you just conversation, it's more easy to learn English I think.
Maybe just a daily activity or a hobby or some sport news, I'll do that.
For me it's conversation and writing.  .
Yes.
Speaking and writing.
Yes and second is writing.
Because it's hard for speaking if you from the - your native is not English.
