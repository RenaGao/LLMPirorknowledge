Yes, of course.
Of course, I like.  
Because, you know, uh, sometimes learning another language, uh, speaking it will make me confidence, so I like.
Actually, it's not that frankly as I thought because, you know, the people around me always speak in Chinese and their English speaking is not that good, so I have to say not that frequently.
Yes, because, you know, uh, practice more, then you - uh, you say it more well.
Uh, I think, uh, Harry Potter, fantasy story.
Yeah.
Sometimes I think Chinese student cannot use English well because they do not have that much opportunity to talk in English, so I think talking to yourself maybe is quite a good way.
I prefer watching English TV series or movies.  Actually, I think Friends and Big Bang is a good choice.
Actually prefer the conversation between two people because, uh, I like speaking, so, you know, in front of lot of people and just to talk and talk and never stop is not that friendly.
Usually, I am good as speaking, but actually, um, I think writing is the most important thing for, as you know - uh, for example, I cannot hear or I cannot make a voice, but I can writing so I can understand it and make people to understand me, so I think writing is more important.
