Of course.
Yes, it's actually my first language.
Well, first of all, I was born with the language so there has not been much of a choice.
And second, uh, I am actually much more comfortable in English than - I am actually much more comfortable in Tagalog than speaking in English.
Alright.  How often do you speak in English in a week, with whom, in which situation and what topics?
That depends actually.  When I am speaking with just by myself as in in my mind, I tend to speak in English because it's actually much more fluent in my mind than actually in real life.  Um, when it comes to Tagalog, I usually speak Tagalog when it comes to my family members especially my relatives somewhere along the XXX   just because they tend to you know not really understand English all that much.
Uh, yeah because English is as you all know is the most spoken language in the world and I would like to have more - more opportunity to speak with other people who are more acquainted to speak in English than Tagalog when it comes to let's say my job since it's - it's much more professional.
Anything that doesn't involve politics.
Well, primarily, my - my number one source of English speaking is by watching shows in English, reading English books and maybe a little bit of talking to yourself---  
In English.
I am actually a little bit extroverted, but not entirely, so I prefer with more than one person speaking.
Is it when it comes to speaking in English?
I really, really think that when it comes to speaking in English, writing is the most important skill.
Because first of all, you learn much of the structure when you write let's say a poem or an article unlike when you are speaking in English most of the times you are speaking in how do you call it, it's not that much structured, ad-hoc, is that how it's supposed to be unlike when you are writing, you have your thoughts in your head which can translates into what you're writing.
