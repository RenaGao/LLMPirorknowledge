Yes.
Yes, of course.
I think English language is, uh, a new language for Thai people.  Uh, I'll - is a new thing that I can use to connect with other - other peoples, uh, such - such as a foreign because I, uh, I live in Hat Yai, is a lot of foreigner.  I - if I can speak as they - as speak them, I will, uh, communicate about my case to them.
Uh, I think it's a little bit of time because I didn't have op - opportunity to use English language, because in my university didn't have a lot of foreigner, and I can't use this language.
I think, uh, the most is, uh, foreigner when - when I go to walk, uh, hangout in the department store, I will, uh, met some - meet some foreigner and I happy to speak to them because they ask me some question about, uh, for example, a direction of some place, just it is---
Yes, I really want the chance but sometimes this chance is little bit, uh, I want a chance - I - I want to go to camp to make a chance to myself, to speak, uh, language to foreigner.
Uh, kind of topic, I want to talk about culture, uh, what culture of them, what do they like to do in their city.
At first, uh, yes, English is really hard to me because, uh, my - uh, my mom cannot speak really, uh, perfectly and is not care to talk with other people.  I - I try this myself by, uh, think in English first to make a sentence in my head, and then I - I try to pronounce out to catches my mouth just to make a sound, uh, to like, uh, native speaker.
I like one to one, because one-to-one speaking is I - I will have a lot of chance to speak.  Do not get the chance to, uh - the - do not have to share the time of the people.  We will just only two of us we will speak together in the same time.
I think, uh, speaking skill is really important because if - if you can read, can write, but if you cannot, uh, comp - comprehend, uh, express your thoughts to another people, I think it's, uh, it's no matter to be better in English if you cannot speak to other people.
