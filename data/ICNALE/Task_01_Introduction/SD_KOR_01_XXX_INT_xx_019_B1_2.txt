Yeah.
Uh, yes, so I guess.
Uh, I just like to speak in English.  It's interesting where I can speak, uh, another language, uh, instead of Korean.  So, I just like it.
A week?
Um, last year, I was in USA, so every day, I speak English, but after I got to Korea, I - I have no, um, opportunity to speak English.
Yes, of course.
Um, just normal things about the life or just the school.
Yeah.
Do you mean why do I like to improve my English?
Um, just speaking alone or I have some foreign friend - friends.  So, I talk to them or watching something in English.
One-to-one, of course.
Um, it's more - it's more like interesting, fun.
Yeah, I can have fun with in that conversation and I can learn about the people.
The most?
Um, maybe listening.
If I can talk, it's okay to live in other country, but if I can't listen or understand anything, I can't live in there.
