Yes.  Yes, sure.
Yes, I like to speak in English.
Well, I think, uh, if I speak English means I'm educated and I belongs to a noble family.  This is - this is some kind of prestige.
In a week, uh, at home, I can - I cannot speak.  Uh, even if I want to speak English, I cannot, uh, speak English because nobody at my home can understand English, so oftenly I speak English in my classroom.
Our academic topics, not my personal life or something like this.
Yes.  If I will get the chances, I will definitely speak English.
Uh, the topics, uh, the - these are my personal - uh, personal topics which I would like to talk in English like politics, international relations and comparative, uh, analysis of different religions.
First of all, uh, I watch a lot of English movies, English drama series.  And, uh, my teachers are also advised me to do so.  And I practice with my teachers.  I used to touch - uh, I used to talk with foreigners on social media.  So, in this ways - uh, in these ways - in these ways, I try to---
Because first you - uh, if you want to do something, this means you need some kind of input, so I think watching movies or talking with some, uh, foreigners is input that you will have.  And when you have input, after this you - you can speak English.
Group discussion.
Because in the, uh, group discussion, different people, uh, have different opinions, so you can talk on any topic, you integrated with a lot of people at the same time.
So---
In communication?
Speaking, writing.
Because, uh, as really we - we, uh, make communication with other peoples with mouth, not writing or listening.
So, the - that is why---
---speaking.
