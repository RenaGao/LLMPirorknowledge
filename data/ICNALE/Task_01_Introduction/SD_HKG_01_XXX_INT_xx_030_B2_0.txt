Hmm.
Yes, I like speaking in English.
Yes, because, um, actually, um, I am born in Hong Kong and from my kindergarten and actually before kindergarten I started learning English and what I think English is actually a beautiful language which I think we can practice the accent like speaking like singing.  So, I think actually the pronunciation of English is better than Cantonese in some way, so I like it.
Um, I think like one - two - about two hours a day.  So maybe a week maybe over 10 hours.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Um, do you mean what I will talk about when I am using English or what way I want to use more English?
Uh, I want like moving to a English speaking country.
Yeah, or like I want my relatives like my daddy, mummy also know English and they can talk to - talk to me in English.
Yeah.
Uh-hmm.
Um, first of all, I think I have the advantage of because I am the English major student so I can talk to professors and I can - I can receive enough English training at school.  And I also go to some tests like IELTS and other test as to prove my English and also I would do - I would try to teach the childrens English in order to make sure my English is good enough to like I want to be a teacher later, so yeah like this.
I don't like group discussion.
Because, um - I usually like to focus on one's conversation.  Yeah, I like to build a better relationship with one people and understand that one more and more than having so many people gossiping and having no points in the discussion.
Yes.
Speaking.
Because people can understand you, um, from the way you speak, um, so I think it is the best way to give peoples the first impression, yeah, because you may not only to look at one people and then do nothing.  You may talk to them and then so I think speaking would be the first step to know people or people know you.
Yes.
