Yeah, of course.
Umm, not really, but I can - I can speak English.  So, I think I like it.
Um, I don't know because I can - I started in English since I - in maybe 10 years old.
I don't know, I forgot it.
So I - I don't - cannot really say if I really like it or not.
Maybe.
A week.  Almost every day, because---
You know.
Um, because and I have a - I've got a part-time job and sometimes I need to speak with some foreign - foreigner customers.
Yeah.
Um, customers from---
---from - from other countries like I guess.
Umm, I am standing at the counter?
Yeah.
The topics - because just like to ask them which meal, which sets they need to order, yeah.
Kind of.
More chances.  I think if I have the chance, I would like to grab it.
Topic.  I don't know but I think the most interest I - I am most interested is communicate with others.
So, chatting - chatting or---
Yeah.
Improve, just speak with other's life.
I suppose that English is - language is a life.  You need to use it often.
But - or you would forgot it - forget how to use it.

You mean speaking with - have a chatting conversation with---
Types of speaking.
I think one-on-one.
Because one-on-one force you to speak.
And group discussion there is - there may be three or four, four or five many, many people.
And sometimes you don't even need to talk.
And you don't have the chance to preface yourself.
Yeah.
Yeah.
In my opinion, I think most important is speaking.
Because if you don't speak and others don't know, what you want to do?
Yes.
Yes.
