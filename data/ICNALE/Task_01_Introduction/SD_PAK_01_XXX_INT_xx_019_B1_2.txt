Yeah, sure, please.
Yeah, I do.
Uh, because it - I like to speak in English.  I like the language and I want to learn it.  As a student it is the way of getting education as well, so.
Uh, not too often but probably in my, um, institutions in my class in my - with my colleagues I used to speak in English.
Different topics.  It depends on the situation.
Yeah, sure.  Why not?
Uh, the general topics, for example, that help me communicate in English?
Okay, I used to talk to my foreign cousins and I used to listen news as well in English, so that I can improve my accent, my vocabulary and other things. 
Uh, not.  Listening to news will improve my vocabulary because many words are used to, uh, learn from news.
But my spoken is improved when I used to talk with the native speakers.
Group discussion.  
Because many people can, uh, interact with you at the same time.  Uh, many people can judge your language.  They can help you - they can tell you that this sentence you have spoken right or this sentence you have made mistake.  So, error correction is, uh, going on at the spot.  So, group conversation is more beneficial in learning spoken language.
I think speaking.
Uh, because as we are human, we live in society so we need to - it is our basic need to communicate to survive in the society.  So, for survival I think this is the basic need to speak.
