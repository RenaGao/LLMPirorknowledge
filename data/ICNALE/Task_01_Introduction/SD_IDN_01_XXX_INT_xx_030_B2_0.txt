Yeah, I like to try to speak in English.
Because I think uh, speaking in English is one of the skills that we have to earn  .
And then, it's fun speaking English.
I don't really know the exact amount of time because we mostly Indonesian speak Indonesian language, yes.
Yes.
Yeah, I think it only, 2 hours per week.
With uh, people that speak - also speak in English like  
Yeah, they are confident in speaking in English.
Yeah, yeah, lecturers and friends in other countries.
Uh, partially, yeah, like we put some English words with our conversation  
I think, any - any kind of topics.
I think it's lifestyle because  
Uh, to speak with other people that speak in English, of course.
Uh, by uh, meeting people that speak in English.  And then for me, like watching television that speak in English, like they really improve my English, yeah, because I know new terms in English.
Yeah.
Uh, because to me, like in English movies they have like easier terms to speak, like it's very different than English that you learn from the classes.  Yeah, to me, it's very - it's so much easier.  So, I can put it like in daily work, daily use, like much more better.
Maybe one-on-one.
Because like ah, sometimes when you talk in a group, you have to like uh, waiting for someone, yeah to finishing.   
Yeah.
Yeah, waiting for our turns, yeah.
Ah, maybe speaking.
Because sometimes people are very, very good in writing.
But they don't have the confidence like to speak in English, like so they - they are very timid to speak English like, yeah.  But I think speaking like we have to understand each other, yeah and then, that's to me is very important.
