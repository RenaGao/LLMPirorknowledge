Yeah, sure.
Very much.
I think, um, I like speaking English because it raises out my confidence level very, very because when I speak in English my confidence levels is boost up and I feel like no one can win over me.
Um, every day, a lot with my friends, especially those from XXX  , yeah.
Um, when we eat, when we do our task together.
Friends, boyfriends, the questions that we have.
Yeah, sure.  I've been looking up for it for a long time now because, you know, when we live in Malaysia we don't really have that kind of spirit where the older speaking in English that kind of spirit, yeah.
Um, I am not sure but for now I like to speak about political economics issues with my friends in the office, and yeah.
What I usually do is I watch movies.  I also read a lot.  I do a lot of reading because I think reading enhance my grammar and my vocab because when I didn't - when I don't understand a certain word, I - I keep on looking it on the dictionary and so on.
When we look at the - the subtitle given, we can understand - some words we can't understand, so we tend - I have the tendency to keep on looking on it what does it mean, how should I use it, how do we pronounce it and is it wrong if you use it like for the XXX   something like that.
Um, I like grouping I think because then we have a lot of idea that we can change because yeah, everyone has a different perspective idea and if we do a grouping - speaking in a group, then we can learn a lot more from a lot of people.

Because when you read, you can write.
And when you read, you have to know how to - how to - how do you pronounce it like, um, when you read, you should know how should you speak in real life situation.
