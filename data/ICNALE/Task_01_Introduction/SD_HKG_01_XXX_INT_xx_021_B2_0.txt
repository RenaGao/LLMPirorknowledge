Sure.
Yes.
Because I think English is interesting than Chinese, I guess.  Even though my mother tongue is Cantonese, I still think that, uh, English is interesting.
Well, I think, uh, quite often because I have a friend who comes from, um, foreign countries and he - and she seldom speaks in Cantonese, so we usually, uh - I usually speak to her with English, so it's quite often.
Everything, like, um, kind of gossip, like celebrities, news and, uh, self-experience and, uh, own interest.
Umm, yes.  We can say yes because I usually watch movies and - and learn some vocabs or phrase from it, so yeah.
Maybe, historical things like, um, to introduce some of the historical buildings to the friends who come from other countries but not Hong Kong.
Uh, I think speak more because when you speak and you are willing to speak you know or you notice words can improve or you read more novels or the others, uh, fiction like that or you try to write and you find that okay so, um, there is a lot of space that like you need to polish yourself.
Um, perhaps group because in group, um, the others may express their experience or ideas with each other, so we can learn from the others or what they can - what we can improve ourself.  And also we, uh - which enhance ourself to speak more.
Um, maybe listening because if you don't know what they talking about you don't even know how to respond them, so I think listening is the most important things for me.
