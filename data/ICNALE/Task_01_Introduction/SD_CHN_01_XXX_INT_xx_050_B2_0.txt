Okay.
Yes, I prefer to speak English in my daily life.  I think it is very social for me to practice my English.
Um, actually I speak English almost every day.
Yes, I am - I'm trying to find more opportunities in my life to practice my English, my oral English and writings, uh, skills.
I like to talk about culture and some politic - politic topics.  And I'd like to - also like to use English to, uh, speak some movies.
Oh, well, firstly I'd like to listen to some, uh, radio in - in English and to learn how to pronounce and to improve my oral English.
I am keen on discussing with other people like in a good discussion because it can make me learn more different views and to improve my English.
I think, uh, speaking is the most important one because you need to, uh, learn something from the books and try to exchange this - this information into yourself.  So, I think speaking is the most vital one.
