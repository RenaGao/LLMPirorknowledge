 Yeah, part --- partly I like to talk umm with someone in English but my English is not so good.  
 So, I am afraid of talking English umm sometimes.
 One week?
 Yeah, I don't speak English usually because I am living yeah in Japan and there is no um-hmm huge umm opportunity to speak Japanese uh English, so just in yeah this Kobe University, yeah.
 Yeah, umm, I have two --- uh I have two classes umm in a week.
 Yeah. Uh-huh. My umm.
 My English teacher is umm Greg --- Greg teach  , so he umm produce --- huh produce us the opportunity to speak English in Japan, yeah.  
 Yeah, I think.
 Topics umm yeah uh-uh --- I want to talk about yeah of course umm the cul --- about the cultures in English because umm, yeah, I --- yeah uh some Japanese people with, so I don't know about the other country's culture. 
 Yeah. I have no opportunity to umm travel abroad, so.  
 Yeah.
 I want to speak about, yeah, different cultures in English.
 Uh. To develop our speaking ability umm --- yeah, I think yeah to develop speaking ability to learn a lot of umm English words uh is I think umm it is really important because umm if --- when I want to talk with some --- with other Eng --- umm --- native English speaker, umm, I don't know what to say about the word umm in English, but uh so I think uh learning uh what English word is yeah really important.
 Um-hmm.
 Yeah. I like one uh one-to-one converse uh conversation communication.  
 Because I can't --- I can't talk a lot --- umm --- I can talk more than the group discussion or a --- a group activity.
 Yeah.
 Uh. Yeah, I think umm yeah speaking.
 Yeah, I think.
 Yeah, because umm you know a lot of Japanese can read or umm write in English but a lot --- a lot of Japanese can't speak or listen, so speak uh listen Engli --- English, so yeah, I think Japanese people want --- should umm develop the speaking ability and the listening ability uh more.
