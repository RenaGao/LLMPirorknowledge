Yes.
Yeah, kind of, like, uh, I'm not so good at speaking English, but hmm, actually I think I like it.
In 1 week, actually I'm, hmm, taking the class in Japanese.  So, I don't have so much time to speaking in English, but hmm, I like the courses like comparative economics which we can speak in English.
Yeah, of course.
Hmm, maybe it's, um, about study or the jobs I find or something like, uh, foods or culture, different countries.
I usually look at, um, serious, I don't know how to say that, and, uh, actually, in - in - in university, my major was English and Japanese.  So it helps me a lot I think.
I think face-to-face is better.
Hmm, I'm kind of scared with there - there'll be a lot of people.  Face to face is more comf - um, comfortable.
I think when the people communicate in the life, it's more - more important to have the, uh, listening and speaking skills.
I think speaking is more important.
Because uh, um, um, I think I'm not good at, um, speaking.
So, um, it's important to tell other people, um, what I'm thinking.
