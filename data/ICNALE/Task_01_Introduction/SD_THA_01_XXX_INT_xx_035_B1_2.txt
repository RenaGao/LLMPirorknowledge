Okay.
Um, I am not sure.  I am not good at speaking English.
I want to like it.
Um, I - I used to like it a lot but when - when I - uh, I try to speak English I am just got stutter over, don't have enough confidence, so I - I don't like.
I will say none.
Uh, if it's outside class, I have no one to talk to in English.
Yes, of course.  Uh, I have been in internship in XXX   and I had - I had used English a lot, and after that, I - I kind of find no one to talk to of course.
I wish I would have someone.
It would be my interest.
Games or something like that.
Yeah.

I just try and try and---
Try to talk.
I - I know that I - I know that I can speak English but there are so many other factor that I need to improve like my confidence, yeah, I have to improve this a lot.  Uh, so, if I want to improve my confidence, I had - I have to get used to it, so I have to use it a lot.  And for me---

And I will start to share my opinion.
Um, I would say writing.
Uh, if - if the other - if the other skill fail you, you can still use writing, except receiver is lying, so - that - that - that is the more obvious.
