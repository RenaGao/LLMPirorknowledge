My pleasure.
Yes, I do.
Uh, I think when I speak English, I discover what I have never known before.
Uh, these days I speak English, um, three times a week.
Uh, normally, I speak English in front of the mirror, and nowadays, I have took an English XXX   course.
Uh, yes, it called XXX   English.
Yes.  I definitely wanted - want to speak English more often.
Um, I think, um, business English right now.  
Uh, I have to read a lot.  So, I get what the people normally say in daily life and the real life.
Yes.
Really, you gain more vocabularies and, um, perfect structural sentences.
I prefer one to one the most.
I think I have more time and chance to speak with the people in front of me, more than lot of people gathering together.
Oh, interesting question, and it has to answer as well.  Um, I will say speaking.
Um, uh, speaking can convey what you want to talk or want people to understand what do you want.
