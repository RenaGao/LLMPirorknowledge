Sure.
Yeah, I like speaking English.
Um, basically, uh, this is, uh, the world of English so we all have to know about a little bit and if we speak in our daily conversation then we would be competent in it.  So, I think---
Uh, I usually talk with my friends in English.  I tried my best to speak in English very well.
Uh, an hour in a day.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah daily, on a daily basis.
My friends, my bus fellows.
I discuss my daily life.  Uh, my friends often ask me about my family, my friends and my habits and I usually talk about that.
Yeah.  Definitely, I want - I - I would definitely want some, you know, uh, platforms where I can conversate with each other and you know---
I would love to talk about the social, uh, realities---
---or social phenomenas.
Yeah.
Yeah, basically, I, uh, just use English in my daily conversation.  I - uh, I listen many talk shows, many international TV channels I follow.
You know, basically, uh, listening makes, uh, if you are good listener, you would be a good speaker so listening improves your speaking very well.  Uh, it's my experience.
Definitely.  Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I like the one-to-one conversation because you, uh - there you have a capacity to talk, time.
Yeah.
I think speaking.
Uh, because if you speak, uh, you would be competent, you would be fluent in your speaking.
Uh, if you just listen that not would be so better - that not would be better for speaking if you don't ruhearse or you know practice it.
