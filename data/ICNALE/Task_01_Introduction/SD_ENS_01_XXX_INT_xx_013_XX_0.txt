Okay, let's go.
I do.
Uh, currently yeah, I am.
Um, well the teachers that I work with, I am lucky.  I've been lucky for a while to be honest with everyone that I've ever worked with I've got along really well.  They are generally very courteous, they are very kind, they're helpful, they're patient, um and I just have a - naturally I think I have a good rapport with my students and so it's just a comfortable experience.  I enjoy myself and I - and I like to see when - what I do if it makes them, you know, happy and satisfied, you know, it's kind of a snowball effect.  It's it makes the working environment comfortable. 
Um, currently in my past contract which has just ended I had about - I had steady 19 a week.
So I teach junior high.  Now I teach high school, pardon me and I am generally teaching like English communication.  I sometimes teach a little bit of sort of basic grammar and phrase work.  The students that I teach even though they are high school, their level is kind of a little bit low.  They would actually kind of if I were to rate them, they are somewhere in the range of like junior high school, maybe second year, first year sometimes.  So I try to get them exposed to sort of the communicative approach of English as much as possible, try and get their message across more than perfecting their use of grammar.
So I teach high school students.  So it makes it boys and girls.
Oh, I teach primarily third grade high school and some second grade.  I didn't teach any first grade this year.
Probably not, it's just because the fact that I am married and my wife is here and you know the whole point is start building a family in the future so that kind of makes that kind of an off-the-table.
Um, well, a really important thing is - it sounds clich�� but practice really is one of the most important things to - to train your mouth how to make the sounds that are required for speaking English and I think a lot of students not only in English but any language, you know, just reading the phrase book, your - your mind kind of maybe understands the rules and how things work but the fluency comes from training your mouth - mouth how to move and certain muscles work differently when speaking different languages.  Not being afraid to just talk to yourself and just practice speaking even though you know you're going to make mistakes because over time your mouth just sort of gets used to it and you get stronger with - with speaking.  And that's generally what I try to tell my students.  Don't be shy, just go.
Okay.
Well, I think it depends on the level.  I think for beginners I think one-on-one is typically more helpful because that's a lot easier to - for the teacher to isolate maybe potential problems and then help, you know, correct any issues and errors.  When a student is more comfortable with the sort of the speed of a conversation in a group then - then that's a better opportunity to be able to hear different kinds of you know ways different people speak.  Because even in one language different people speak differently.  So I think it - I think it really depends on the level.
Um, I would say that listening is probably the most important um, because you now if you're not - if you can't understand what you are trying to say, that makes it difficult to duplicate.  So I mean I think that's pretty much the simplest way of explaining it.
