Yes, sir
Yeah, I like.
Because it's interesting.
I can learn other language other than Indonesian and Japanese.
Yes.
Around 4 days I think in 7 days.
Yeah.  I think it's around 10 to 12 hours a week?  
Yeah, I like to talk with my brother in home.  I talk about anything randomly actually about politics, about sports, about what happened in - in the near present - present time.  So, it's actually quite random things we talk about.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.  I think I would like to speak in more and more audience.
Yeah, I think that will be interesting.
Usually I watch movies first and then I learn about, I listen the dialogue and then I search in - on Google or I also read some article about sports mostly because I like sports and then I also listen to the music that use English language.
I think because we - sometimes the quote from the character is really, really iconic so we - we really like it and then we try to imitate the dialogue and kind of so.
Yeah, yeah, because they are speaking with - not, not plainly, they speak it with - like their character is very, very, very good, so we like to imitate it.
I will say I prefer to the one-on-one conversation.
Because I think it really helps you to know your English better.  I mean in group discussion I think some people will be more quiet than the other because the dominant one will dominate the conversation in the group discussion.
Yeah, yeah.
I think in the academics basic like us, I think we need to be more able to read better than speak or write or listen.
Because we are related to the journals and then books and everything in literal - literature like that.  So, we need to read better and know the meaning better and we can find a better knowledge in the books or journals.
