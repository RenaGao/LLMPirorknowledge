Yes, I like to speak in English.
Because I feel so comfortable and usually I only talk in English, uh, like things in the - and I have a lot of friends in, uh, other countries which allows me - which means to communicate in English.
Uh, five days.

Like recently I'm more into makeup fashion, skin care, so I think I can deliver more about that, about the ingredients about the, um, what is stuff that you need to do to makeups or skincare team.
Uh, what I usually do is like listening to English music and, uh, look for the lyrics so I can see the grammars and sometimes I read books and journals, so I can see how do we write the books or journal with honest XXX  .
Group discussion.
Because, um, we - um, during the, ah, group discussion we have a lot of ideas, so we bring some the ideas and generate it one by one, so it's really great for us to share and improve ourselves to.
Most important, writing.
Because, um, being myself I - I need to write more because when this - when we speak or listen, we normally didn't know the correct grammar or vocabulary that we need to use.  By writing we can shows that grammar is not good - is not correct in set a sentence and you need to improve more vocabulary like synonyms, antonyms and so on and more.
