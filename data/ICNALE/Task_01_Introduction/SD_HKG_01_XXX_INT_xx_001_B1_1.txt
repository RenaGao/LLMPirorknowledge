Yes.
Yeah, um, I think so.
Because English is a international language, uh, which is why they are used so, uh, so and then I learn a lot of foreign culture which is speaking English too so I love to speak English.
Um, maybe, once a week.
Uh, maybe, my friends come from the foreign country, yeah, maybe - uh, maybe from India, from - so we talk English.  We communicate by English.
This is the same daily stuff like, uh, you know, boys likes to talk about sports, the NBA, the Premier Leagues, something like that.
Yes.
Uh, because it's a good chance to practice how to speak English fluently, so I want to have more chance to speak English.   
Um, maybe, some just daily stuff, maybe, ah, sports, um, maybe even, uh, news of the day or something, uh, just funny.
Yeah, in my case, I love to watch with, uh, comics - anime from, uh, YouTube, uh, about, eh, which speak in English, so I can learn how to, uh, speak English, uh, faster.
Eh, uh, pardon me, I am sorry.   
Um, because I think, uh, it's more fun to, uh, learn from - uh, learn from comics of the - just not too academics from learning from English, so I think so listening is a good choice.
Definitely, the group, uh, communication because you have more people to communicate and easy to XXX  .
Um, I think it's speaking because, you know, you use - speak every day, you communicate with people every day, ah, the first impression of people thinks about your English level is what you speak so I think speaking is the most important, yeah.
