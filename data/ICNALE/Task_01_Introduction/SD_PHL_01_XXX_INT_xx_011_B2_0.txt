Yes.
Umm, I like it, because ah I, sometimes I can express more easily in English, because certain vocabularies that I, I don't know, that I don't know in Filipino are sometimes ah, it's just more, it's just more easily and, and smoother when I talk in English.
Ah, hmm, I think possibly every day I speak English.  And it's, and I speak English mostly towards my friends especially online when we play some games and talk to each other, especially my friends from the bus, because we don't meet as much.  We don't meet as much anymore and so, the only time we can meet is online.
I think I would want to have more chances, so I can be more fluent in it, like be more smoother in talking and be more hmm, a big XXX  , be more, so I, so I can heighten my English speaking.
Hmm, for my case, I think what I usually do is I talk to myself.  Sometimes it's only, like in my mind, I do some, something like monologue or like thinking of making speeches, something like that.
I think I like better the one, one-one conversations.
Because it's like, I'm, I can focus more easily towards the one I'm talking with.  And I think I can be more focused on the subject that we are talking about.  And I think I'd be more comfortable with only, only in one on one.
I think the most important would be speaking.
I think it is important because even sometimes people doesn't   know how to read and sometimes people don't know how to write.  I think speaking is the most basic and the one that people most likely will understand the most.
