Okay.  Good afternoon too.  
Yes.
Yes.
I like English because it - to me it you know it helps us in terms of communication not only in among the ways of Malaysian, it also in other ways or another tourists or something like that.
It also enhance our - and our knowledge as well.
In a week.
Maybe around four - four times.
With whom?  With my friend, with - with my lecturer and in the class as well they use this English language.
In class also I have friends that I can fully speak in English.
We talk about life, we talk about our experience, we talk about everything.
Yes.
Maybe regarding in English regarding life's experience and regarding culture in each country.
Yes.
English speaking.  
I usually have a conversation with my friends.  I listen to music and also sing along with the lyrics as well.  I watch movies and I follow the way that they speak.
Hmm and even though I feel scared in the class I try, I - I manage to have some courage to talk in English.
The speaking type.  I prefer the conversation between one-to-one individual.
Because to me when we're talking individually we can reveal our feelings more and we can be more honest about our own opinion because some people they cannot speak, they are unable to speak properly in front of people and they are - they feel afraid.  That's why they won't be able to speak their own true feelings.
For me - for me it's speaking.
Because like I said before when you - when you go to outside world you need to communicate well with the others and then some - some people may - may unable to understand your language.  So, the only language that most people will be able to speak in English.  That's why I prefer speaking.
