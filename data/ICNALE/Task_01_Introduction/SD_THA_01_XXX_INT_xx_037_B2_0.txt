Yeah, of course.
Uh, I think, um, as I studied in, uh, English and Chinese program when I was a high school student and I thought, I was good in English, so I - I love to speak in English.
A week, um, not much.  Um, I seldom speak English because all the time I speak Thai with my friends and just, um, speak English in the class with, uh, foreigner teacher.  Uh, just once - uh, three times, uh, three times a week.
Yes, of course.  I want to get more - uh, chances to - uh, speak English because I am a English major student, so I have to improve my speaking and this seem very important.
Just general life, everything is going, anything but except economy.
Except economy, uh, politics, because I am not - I don't know, I don't have a - enough background knowledge about this topic.
Uh, actually, um, I have an idols like, um, singers, um, actor or actress that they are foreigner, and if the student or English learner, uh, try to love them or just want to understand what they are speaking or what they are doing, yes, it's one way to, uh, improve in English and another way to improve in English is to study the - easy way.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.  Um, another tactics for me is speaking in English with my friends.  Uh, other class and---
Speaking.
Um, to - English is an official, uh, language of many countries in the world, and you know, uh, if anyone can speak English, that - you have chances to work abroad and you got a lot of - got more chance to do a better life - better work and speaking is kind of communications, we can open the world - the world.
