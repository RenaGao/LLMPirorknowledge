Yes, go ahead.
Yes, I like speaking in English.
Um, because I love to read the literature text and most of them are in English and I think - I found the fun and yeah fun to read in English and find some maybe word game when they are applying the English text.  So, I like English and I want to study and I want to improve me.
Um, after I study in the university and I speak English everyday because, uh, one of my friend, eh, is a English speaker so we need to communicate in English, so, eh - so my frequency of using English is, uh, increased, eh, when I am studying in university.
Yes, of course.  It will, uh, give me more time or more, uh, chances to practice it.  I think practice, eh, is the best way to improve the English, so yes.
What?
Uh, maybe day - some daily stuff or yeah and maybe, uh, just talking about what I like and what is my favorite thing and what I have gone through, uh, the previous day with my friends and something like this, yeah.
Uh, I usually watch the, uh, video, maybe some Variety show or some TED Talks to maybe listen more and then, yeah, to learn to, and learn from them and yes study, uh, how they speak and how they use the language and what's their accents and choose my favorite one to follow it, yeah.
Um, I like one-on-one conversation because I know group discussion maybe give me some pressure, I don't know how to maybe get into the group or I - I am not very good at, uh, uh, maybe us, uh - to speak around for more than one people and I am, yeah.  So, I like one-on-one conversation.
I think speaking is the most important skills as, uh, if we - the most we - the - because speaking we - we need to speak everyday and if we won't we need - we - we can speak in English then I think it's no problem to use, uh, in other field like reading or listening.  So if you - you - you know how to speak and you will know how to read and listen and writing will be improved XXX  .
