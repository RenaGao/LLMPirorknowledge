Okay.
Uh, I - I do like speaking English because, uh, because of - I have to study in English major, and I - I love listening to English music.
In a week, uh, I use English - English every day, and - but - but just in the classroom, but - but not outside of classroom, we - we - we don't, uh, I - I am not - I don't use it.
Um, I talk - I usually talk with my friends and teachers in a topic like about what we are studying and - and like, uh, ordinary conversation.
Yes, of course, I want.
Uh, I just - not specific of that.  Just easy conversation is all right.
Uh, for me, I - I, um, no specific.  I just listen to the music and watching like series and, uh, for talking, I just - you know, I just talking to myself - to myself, uh, in front of the mirror is improved me a lot.
Yes.  But sometime I have - I have - I shy - have a shy.  I can't talk, uh - I can't talk directly to the, uh, native speakers.
I - I more like, uh, group discussions because I - I want to have people, uh - a lot of people have to make conversation.
For me, I think speaking is more important because we have to like communicate with a lot of people.  Uh, speaking is just the way to communicate directly.
