I can improve my skill in English.
Like last week I speak it every day.
Like for a month and for my daily life I only speak like for a day per week.
Usually when I chat my - my friend from another countries or maybe with just my another friend who wants to speak English more.
I like to talk about other countries, the cultures, the musics  , the foods of other country.
I usually chat with my online friends in English or I just can speak with my old friend when they will come here or I just practice it with my other friends.
For movies for my listening skills.
Yeah.
I like - I prefer group discussion more because we have a lot of point of view.
---with other person.  So, it will open my mind like more widely.
Uhm, I think it's writing.
Because - because from writing you can just little bit more brave to go to the speaking.  So, yeah I think writing is important.
Uhm, no.
