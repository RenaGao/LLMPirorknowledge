Yes, I do.
Yeah, I'm pretty satisfied.
Uhm, well compared to like most Japanese jobs, we tend to work less hours.  Mine until 4:15 and then after that I am able to follow what I want to do in the day.
On average, uh, I would say about more than 35.
English?
Uhm, well it changes during the week.  It's either to do about verbs, sports, depending on elementary school, colors, you know, just simple things.
Uhm, I am teaching junior high and elementary students.
Uhm, all of them.
Yeah.
Oh actually right now, no.  I - I am quite happy here in Japan.
No.
Uhm, I think - well - let me see - I have experience with that because English is not my first language either.  Uhm, I think just try to follow things that they actually enjoy doing, for example, I enjoy movies.  So I try to sing along, watch movies, uhm, just, you know, concentrate on things that they like, not what just the textbook want them to learn.
Yeah.
Uh, group, group.
Kind of easier to break the ice.
They are very GENKI   here.
Yeah.
For English learners, I would say first listening.
Uhm, from listening comes understanding.  It's very important to first understand what the person is trying to tell you.  Uhm, even if you can't say anything, back but just try and, you know, just gesture or pointing is enough.  Just listening is most important first.
