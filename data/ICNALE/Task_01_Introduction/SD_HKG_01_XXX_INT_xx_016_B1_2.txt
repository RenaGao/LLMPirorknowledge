Yes.
Uh, that's all right.
Uh, anyway it's not my home - mother tongue and if I have a choice I will go for Cantonese instead of English because I, uh, it's less comfortable when speaking this kind of foreign language.
Uh, in a week, if I have lessons I will speak English, uh, for, uh, at least - at least 15 minutes a day, I think.
Uh, yes if it's going to benefit my career or so and I will.
Uh, no.
Uh, what I will do is go watch some kind of documentary that - and include some kind of topic that I am interested and keep on listening like, um, listening to TED Talks and you mock how they speak and then you will eventually improve.
Uh, I believe I prefer a one-to-one--- 
---instead of group.  Uh, because when you are talking in groups you need to consider if others have the opinit - opportunity to speak.
And, it - I will find myself harder to express my own opinions because you need to, yeah, look if others or - also want to speak in a group discussion.
Yes.
Uh, I think, writing.  Writing is kind of showing your ability to create something according to the language you're learning.  And it shows your understanding towards your language but in - like in speaking you're more, uh, flexible that, uh, people knowing what you're trying to say by other kind of element like body language and they are more easy on you because they are not so strict on grammar.
