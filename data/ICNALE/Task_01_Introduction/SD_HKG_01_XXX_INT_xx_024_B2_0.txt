Sure.
Well, um, because I spent a couple of years abroad so I actually like speaking in English.  English is a beautiful language.  I, uh - I consider myself as fluent in English as compared to Cantonese as well.
Well, uh, I speak English during my lessons.  Uh, on a daily basis, not so much, mainly because I have, um, Cantonese friends, on a presentation I use English as well.
Um, I don't mind, I mean, uh, I think the chance to speaking in English depends on myself actually, even if people talk to me in Cantonese I can still speak in English.  It doesn't really matter of - if I am given - actually given the chance is a personal choice, I think.
Well, uh, to me, I - I think spending years in the UK actually helped a lot for me to improve my spoken and, um, written English.  But in general I think the easiest way is to just watch some, um, talk show, not TV show because they have jargons but, uh, we can watch some, uh, political, um, speeches that really helps I think.
Well, personally I think group discussion is more productive in a way that you - you get, uh, a lot of opinions and, uh, advices from other people whereas one-to-one in, um - interaction is more intimate, you can focus on that one person, but on a personal basis I am more of, um, actual XXX   and I like speaking to a lot of people.
Yes.
Um, on my personal opinion I think that spoken English is actually the most important, because the - the whole point of learning a language is that you have - you can actually use it with others.  Whereas, listening, yes you can understand others but you are not expressing yourself.  Writing is not so much used on a daily basis.  And so speaking is, uh, I think the most important in a way.
