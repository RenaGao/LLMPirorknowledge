Yes
Yeah.
Um, because I think speaking English can help me to build up my confidence.  And I think it's - if I can speak English fluently and people will think, oh, this girl great, oh.  I like this.
Yeah.
Almost every day.
With my classmates or with my professor or when I'm typing my homework.
Uh, sometimes I will like - I would want you practice my speaking English with my classmate and at that situation I will, uh, speak English with my classmate and do my best to express my feeling to my classmate.
Uh, like I like to share my life with my classmates, and some topics, some news.  So, I will speak in English and to - and make sure that my friends can know what I'm talking in English.
Yes.
Some topic about life.
Yeah, daily lives.
Um, I do watch TV, and I watch some movies.  And in movies, for example, American movies you can learn some daily English speaking from the TV show - TV show or movie.
And I - I will imitate their language. 
Yeah.
Um, one on one.
Um, actually, I'm shy girl and I don't like everybody to look at me when I am speaking.  You know it make me feel stressed or I like - I prefer one on one speaking.
I think listening.
Once you convince me you can understand others and others - what others are trying to say, and then you can - you can learn speaking from listening.  So, I think listening is the most important.
