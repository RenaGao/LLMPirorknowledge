Yes, please.
Little bit.
Because it's important in our society.  Uh, people give importance to English.
Uh, very little.
Anything.
No.
Because it's not my national language.
So, I don't prefer this.
Not very, uh, bold topics.
Normal talks.
That felt do with each other.
Hmm, that's, uh, I can improve my English speaking by watching movies, foreign good movies or novels.
Because we can see that how they are talking to each other and vocabularies, all things.
One-to-one.
No reason.
Yes, group discussion.
No particular reason.
By reading and listening.
Because by reading, your mind pick up all the things that you are reading and you can pick up most things in that language.
And listening - by listening, you can, uh, learn the way by their talking to each other.
