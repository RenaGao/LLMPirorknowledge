Um, I like to speak English with foreigners.
I - I can't think of reason I just enjoy it.
A week, does it count when I just speaking mentally and I just pop up with English words.
Yes, pure English.  Um, twice.
May be twice, yeah.
In class and sometimes speak with some foreign students.
Um, in class, there are - there is a specific - specific topic and speaking with other students about studying or just some normal conversation.
Yeah.
Nothing specific.
Sometimes I speak English at home.
Um, listen to some radios and just practice myself.
Um, perhaps group discussion.
Um, I can compare these two - they are both - there are both chances for me to speak English, so.
Yeah.
Speaking.
I think speaking allows us to communicate with each other.
In English.
