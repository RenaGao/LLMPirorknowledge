Oh, yeah.
Yeah, uh, I like to speaking   in English.
Yeah, because uh, English is very important and it's about language of the world.  So I think I can communicate my - my mind better to foreigner.
Uh, in a week maybe about 4 to 5 hour.
Oh, yeah, actually I have been joined - joining the virtual group which is like a language hub.  So, uh, it could help me to improve my English.  I can practice my speaking or writing on there.  Uh so, I speak my English uh, and send - and send the audio message on there and some members could give me a feedback. 
Usually we talk about general issue, like daily and some uh, yeah some uh casual issue like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh yeah, I force myself, I encourage myself to practice every day to native.  So they don't know another language expect - except English.  So uh, I will try with my best to make them understand what I was saying.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I like uh, group discussion.
Because, you know, yeah, I - I have a - a bit complicated to speak in English so maybe another people could back up me like that.
Uh, it depend   on the purpose I think because for daily maybe listening and speaking is more important.  But for academic, I think writing and reading is more important.
Yeah.
