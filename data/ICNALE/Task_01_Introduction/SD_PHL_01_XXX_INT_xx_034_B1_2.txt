Yes.
 I like to speak English because it ah enhances my critical thinking because as you all know, ah I do not speak English every day, so I like to speak English at some of the time of my day so that I could enhance my critical thinking.
Umm I can say that I use English at least five days.
I often use English with my classmates.
Usually it is ah related to our topics inside the class and umm sometimes we have a little conversation that we speak in English but it is just around them.
Yeah.
I prefer umm topics that is more personal so that I could enhance my vocabulary and be natural while speaking English.
I usually watch movies or umm international YouTube vlogs so that I could learn how they naturally speak English.
I prefer group discussions because I can gain more umm thoughts with other people than just one-to-one discussion.
I guess the most important think or the skill is the speaking thing because ah it does not involve your knowledge about English it also involves your confidence in speaking English.
