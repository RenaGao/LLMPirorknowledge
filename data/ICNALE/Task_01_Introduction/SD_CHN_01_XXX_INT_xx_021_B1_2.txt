Okay.  Of course.
Uh, as I mention I had to speak English, but here in university, rather than speaking Japanese, I usually prefer to speak English.
One week, uh, every day.
Even in my lab.
More chances?  Um, I think right now maybe it's okay just, um, um, if it's enough to use in my life, then maybe it's okay.
Uh, exactly when I was chatting with my Japanese, uh, classmates, I always use English.  We talk about our interests, something like animate or movies, books, uh, everything.
Speaking ability?  Uh, well, I think maybe first I - I would like to watch English movie, uh, American drama especially.  Um, um, only about the---.
Maybe just when I was preparing my TOEFL exam, I want to increase, uh, my speaking skill, and I - at that time, I usually, uh, um, try to use English with my Chinese friend because we are all preparing this exam.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think all are okay.
Any difference?  Well, according to me, maybe, face-to-face is better because, um, in group, well, is not about my English-speaking ability, just I'm a little shy---.
Most important skill?
Uh, um, I think it's, uh, listening.
Because, um, if I'm reading something, it's easier to understand.
Uh, for communication, if you cannot understand what the - your - just people are talking about, um, you cannot communicate then.
That's only my opinion.
