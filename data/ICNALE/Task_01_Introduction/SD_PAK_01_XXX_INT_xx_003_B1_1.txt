Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Because I have - I had a course in translation studies and so it's a right - or - opportunity to talk in English with others.
Hmm, mostly in - during lecture.
Or, uh, some words - uh, common words with friends.
Hmm.
Yeah, sure.
Mostly in our daily life, uh, the - we - we talk to others, eh, we have an, uh, um, uh, idea are to improve our English with grammar, so I really want to talk a person who also interested to talk in English.
To talk with friends, it - also, uh, an opportunity to correct their many mistakes in our English to talk with the teachers and any outsider in the university.
Uh, sometimes, uh, we face the persons who even don't know about how to talk or to - and at that time we have to, uh, pay attention or give, uh - have some attention from the others we, uh, use English language because that person really impress about, uh, this language and the way of attitude we behave with others.
The mostly is group one.
Because there are different, uh, peoples in our group and they have different ideas about any English.  Like we talk or we discuss a paragraph, everyone have a new idea about, uh, her or his concept.  They give all their concept in English and in that case we really improve, uh, some words from the others.
Yeah.
Uh, listen.
Because when we listen from others then we write.
And, when we write we improve the things.
First of all, for everything we have to firstly listen that.
