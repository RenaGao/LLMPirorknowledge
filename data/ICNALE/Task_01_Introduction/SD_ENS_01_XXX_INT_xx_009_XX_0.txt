Thank you.
Uh-huh.
That's right.
Moderately so.
I would like to have more hours at a higher rate of pay, but then wouldn't everybody?
At the moment about six or seven depending on the week.
I teach mostly corporate classes.  And I go by the textbook that the - typically dispatch company will have provided me to teach those classes with.
Mostly businessmen or women.
Age range, anything from low 20s to late 50s.
I've toyed with the idea of teaching English in China or Saudi Arabia.
If I were to investigate it further, then yes it - it would only happen if it were in a positive light.
I know.
Specifically for Japan I think they should try to get - get rid of the notion that making mistakes is - is - is bad.  And be prepared to, be prepared to have errors in their speech and be corrected and through correction learn - learn more.
I have lots of students who I - I am pretty sure they have a good inkling of how to say it, but they won't commit themselves to an answer unless they are 100% sure they can get it correct.
Again, specifically in Japan I found that if I open it to a group discussion where people have to volunteer then sometimes the - there's a paucity of volunteers.  So I found they generally benefit more from one-to-one.  Or if it is group, very much an artificial group as in I am prompting student A, student B your turn to contribute, which isn't actually how a group discussion would naturally occur but---
I would say speaking.
Well, most of my - my students are businessmen or women and that the reason they need it most is for dealing face-to-face with foreign visitors whether they be customers, suppliers, etcetera.
