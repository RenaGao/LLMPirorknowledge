Ah, at this point, no and I am switching.
Ah, it's just something I feel like my skills aren't really suited for it.
Ahh, right now close to 16, I would say.
Right now I am teaching junior high school and elementary school, so there is basic grammar involved, but mostly like conversational English.
Junior high, fairly high level.
Ahh, first year through third year and all of the elementary grades.
Ahh, not at this point.

Uh, just don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid to make mistakes.  I think mistakes are the best way to learn and to grow as a language learner.
Yeah, I think it depends on what your goals are.  They probably feel more comfortable in a group. Uhm, or they can even depend on the students.  Some students feel comfortable more - in a more intimate sort of conversational situation, but others feel more comfortable in a group.  So it depends on the student and I think it depends on your goals.

Hmm.
I'd say probably listening first, just because it is really important in terms of learning how to communicate.
If you can't listen, it's hard to communicate with people.
