Yeah, I love it.  I have many - I have some friends from other countries like Turkey, United States, uh, yeah.
Because I think it is a common language in - in our world, in our business world, and it - this is our - this is easy to learn if you have, uh, inspiration to learn it.
I think it's just about, uh, 2 hours or 1 hours.
A week, yeah.
With my friends from other countries.  And sometimes in our class, maybe just a little bit.
Yes, I want a chance to speak more English and get a better - better than this.
I want to talk about business and, uh, just casual things, common things in our life.
I think it's just - we - you should - you should start from reading some paragraph, some text.  And you should start from the easy text, and you try to - you try to read harder - harder things like, uh, news.  Yeah, so if you - if you start from read, you can know word, you have a word in your - in your thought, in your minds and you can gather it to - to make a sentence.
Yes, I think it's because reading can help you to have a lot of word, a lot of word in - in your thought, in your mind, and that's help you to gather - together to put in the sentences to speak.
Yeah.
I think one to one is - I prefer to one to one to, uh, group discussion.
It's just talk - talk to each other like talk about casual thing, but talk in group discussion is like, uh, you have many - many hard things to do, many staff to - to do in a group, and it uses some, uh, difficult word to say, maybe in our business, like a business reading, just like that.
I think, uh, speaking.
Because if you can speak, you can communicate with others, you can know what other people think or their thought - what do they - they think about you, uh, how to uh, order something you want in a social media like that.
