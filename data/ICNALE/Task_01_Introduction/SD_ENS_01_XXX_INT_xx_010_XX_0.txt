Yeah.
Uh, umm I suppose, yeah.
Because it's fun.
Yeah.
Teaching kids is you know a lot of an exercise and it's very fun.
Uh, I have about roughly four classes per day, so nearly 20 classes a week.
Umm, mainly basic stuff because I teach kids sort of very young age, so basic A, B, Cs, colors, animals is majority of the kind of work.
Uh, students, ah, mainly under 5 years old.
Yeah.
Uhm I suppose yeah.  It would be fun to go to another country.
Uh, well I mean regards to teaching, I'd like to go to Korea, I'd like to go to maybe some other country in Europe so - because I want to go there, teaching would be an easy way to be able to sustain myself in the country.
Umm, Korea specifically because I feel - feel like it's more westernized version of Japan.
Uh, well I can only speak for Japanese students really, but the more - the most difficult part of English for Japanese people is pronunciation, so for Japanese students I feel getting the pronunciation - pronunciation perfect from the beginning is really - should be really top priority.
Umm, probably one-to-one because they can get the focus, umm, the teacher can spend more time with them on their mistakes.
In a group discussion it could be everybody making the same mistake kind of thing and the teacher may not have time to deal with student individual issues.
Umm, I would definitely say it's one of the inputs: reading or listening, not really output so much.
Sure, so I - I feel like, uh, I think that the outputting in a - in a languages is not so difficult, even babies can say random things.  But input is extremely important, you know, to read signs when you walk around the town, you know, to listen to people or the police, for example, when they talk to you is way more important than being able to answer.
