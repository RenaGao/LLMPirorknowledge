No sir.
Because I have been very fortunate and I did not need to work a part-time job for to continue my continue my education sir.
Umm, if I am going to teach, I would rather try home schooling, sir because in home schooling you can better improve your teaching skills and bet and because you only have one student, so you can focus better on him and you can focus better on yourself on how are you gonna teach him than going to school where you are gonna be much more burdened with teaching a lot of students.
Umm mostly I agree that college student should have part-time jobs because they should be old enough to manage their time.  And having a part-time job will teach you ah more discipline and will teach you more experience about really working outside.
