Uh, actually not yet but I am planning to like maybe in the next semester and I want to find some part-time jobs.
Uh, actually, I had thought about, uh, doing part-time as like the public libraries like maybe XXX   if I have a chance because I have been a librarian before and I think I may want to try to do - really do it in the, uh, public libraries.
I'll try to be private tutor because, um, teaching one kid or one teenager is, uh - it should be more easy than teaching a group of the kids.  Um, teaching one - one person, you can focus on his, um, studies very well and you can follow up with like watching YouTube to help.  But if you're teaching a group you may not know all the kids, uh, situation so well and it may be hard for you to help them all.
I agree with that because the part-time work can really maybe help you find out what you are interested in doing or what weaknesses you have and you encounter some problems in your jobs and in the future you may know more - you - you may know how to deal with these problems in your dream job that you may want to do.
