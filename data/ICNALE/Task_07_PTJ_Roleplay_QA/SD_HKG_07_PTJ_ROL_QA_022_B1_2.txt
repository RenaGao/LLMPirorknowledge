Yes, um, I am still working part-time till now.  And one of them are in, uh, is a Japani - uh, was a Ja, uh - is a Japanese restaurant - uh, restaurant and I - this is a summer job and then other than I have a - I'm become a tutor to teach some primary school students and help them to follow their homework.  And also I did, uh, I - I am now doing the sales of UNIQLO, and, uh, yes, this is all my part-time job.
Uh, not really but because the - the biggest reason is that salary is the highest, so, uh - it's 65 per hours and it's much more higher than other summer job and, yeah, because uh - uh, I also can get the discount by buying their clothes and their clothes is really quite good, I think it's suitable for me, eh, so, uh, I did that job.
Um, as I try - I have tried the private tutor once so I am - I want to try the maybe to teach a group of student at the same time, yes, as tutor, as I think, um, as my experience that, uh, I cannot gain the, uh - that to me, uh, the private, uh - the private one the student may not really listen to you as where you teaches at their home and they are the master of the house.  And I cannot gain the, uh, the right to maybe scold them when they really didn't listen to you and even that I am very angry that they're playing around and not listen.  Then I think that, uh, group, uh, group stu - uh, to teach a group of students, and - will be a challenging job and but at the same time it's not, uh, at their home and maybe they will start to listen to the teacher, so, yeah, it's more challenging maybe.
Um, I agree that, uh, have a part-time job is really important that, uh, because when you find the job after you graduate, and the company or, eh, some, uh, organization will really value what, eh - what's your experience and, uh, ha - what you worked on and they will maybe - even, uh, they will have more faith on you, uh, if you have, uh, many experiences than, uh, other fresh graduate.
