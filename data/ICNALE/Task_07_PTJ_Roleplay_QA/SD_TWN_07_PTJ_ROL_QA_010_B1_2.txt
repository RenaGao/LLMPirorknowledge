No.
Um, in cram school.
Because, um, uh, if I go to a student's house I will very scared.
Because, um, very, uh, many movies will - will show terrible things in the house.
Their families I don't know.
So, in the cram school they are - they are legal, they are very open.
So, I feel much safer.
Um, Um, I think it help them.
Because some people needs to do part-time job to earn money.
Or to learn what they want.
But some people they don't need this.
Because they want to - what they want is in the college.
So I think this is   different from a need one.
