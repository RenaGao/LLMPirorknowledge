As a college student?
In my life?
Yes.
Yes.
One of them was landscape gardening.  The other was in a factory helping actually design woolen clothing.  Anything else?
Oh, I just landed them word-of-mouth and I was happy to have the money.  I didn't really consider what kind of thing I'd like to do, besides I wasn't just looking anyway, so---
It just came my way and the money was okay, so I took it.  Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I need some more details on the cram school.  If the levels were not - what's the word I'm looking for XXX   to students in a cram school, I would probably prefer to work at a cram school.  Simply - simply for the fact that I like giving a lot of energy to the children and - and bringing it out of them and having XXX   with them.  Whereas, one-on-one can be a little bit difficult even if the pay is better, it doesn't matter.
Okay.
Depends on the individual.  I don't know.  But provided they are mentally stimulated and - and keeping the majority of their focus on the studies, then one would never have a problem with it really.  If my - if my children said, look dad, I want to work there because I want the experience while I'm studying, I would say, well, can you enjoy both at once and they said, yes, then I would say, well, go for it.  Otherwise, quit and just concentrate on your studies.
