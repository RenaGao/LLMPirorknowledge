Yes, I had worked part-time.
Yes, I still have part-time job.
Uh, I worked at a cram school as a assistant to help - to help students on their homework.
I think because I am - I am just graduated from school - from high school, so - so I am familiar to this knowledges and know how to solve this constraints and I can also give the student some - some - some tips of learning XXX  .
Uh.
I think maybe I will really like to be a home tutor because I can - I can put all my concentration my - my student XXX   and very - many students because, um, more students will have more - more problems.
I think having part-time job is more better to a college student.
Because, um - because, um, companies they would like the graduates to have some exp - experience of - experience of work.  So, I think if you have do some part-time job efforts you can more easier to get a job after you graduate.
