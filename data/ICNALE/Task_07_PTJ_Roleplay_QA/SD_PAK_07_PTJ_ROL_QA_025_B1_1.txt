Sorry?
Yes.
Yes, I am doing.
Yes, actually, I - since I have been a student of com - computer science and IT, I have many courses related to IT, so I am just doing freelancing in a company.
Since I am a student, so I think freelancing is easy for me because I can, uh, do my whole business at my home, in my room at my laptop instead of going or attending my office, so that's why I choose freelancing.
Would like to try, uh, home tuition.
Uh, since my timing of universities are from 7 to 4 p.m., so I think I have only time for home tuition.
That's why.
Yes, I agree since I am doing my part-time job. 
Because I think that it gives you a lot than your studies as it gives you the experience, it gives you the many, uh, uh, you can see, uh, many abilities like speaking abilities, like working abilities, and many others.
