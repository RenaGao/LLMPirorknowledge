Yes.
Yes.
So I am a student assistant in a university.
Uh, at first, we - uh, at first, I thought that students from my university are not allowed to have work outside the university, so I applied to the student assistantship.  But other than that, while I was working now I - I still decided to continue being an SA because it's a lot more comfortable when you are dealing with people that is from your environment.
Maybe in home school.
Because it's a lot - at home school, the student would have a very comfortable environment and then it's - for me it's a very good place for learning and studying.   
At some point, I agree because not all the people that work - not all the people, uh, not all applies that it's what did you say, agree.  I agree that.  I agree that---  
Part-time job should - I agree that college students shouldn't have part-time job.
Shouldn't.
Partly agree.
Shouldn't have part-time jobs because not all students can handle two works at the same time.  But I also disagree because it - uh, it - it uh, it is not good for the development of the student because they lack of experience for the real world like conceptual versus experience, it's - it's a lot more different.
