Actually no.
Uh, part - uh, one reason is I am lazy and I am not that, uh, quite lack of money.  Uh, second one is, you know, part-time job always take your weekend or summer vacation or the spring festival vacation, but I have a important task, uh, on the March, June, September, and October, so I have to say, all my vacation have been, uh, taken by these tasks.  So, I really have time to do part-time job.
I would prefer teaching in the organization because it's more safe for college student.  You know, uh, teaching one child in his or her home, uh, sometimes is not that quite safe because, uh, you know, it looks like that, uh, you having lot in his home - his or her home, so I do not prefer that.  Uh, teaching in the organization, your salaries have guarantee and your time or - or the something, you know, you have to organized, uh, it's quite clear and similar.
I think I never face that situation, but if my student do not listen to me, I won't yell he - him or her at once, but I will ask or talk with he---
Or she, I will also reason why and now we - we can, you know, uh, have some conversation or, you know, have something to change or to adjust our situation.
Uh, for our spending, I agree, because we all stay in the college.  We have dreams but never make it into practice.  So XXX   dreamer and if not a fit in the society why don't XXX  .
Yeah, it's reasonable.
