Yes, I did.

And checking the ID's.
Well, because the place that I was living, it was more local area, so working at the university where I was - it was much easier than commuting to a different long distance to get another part-time job.  So very convenient to be where you are studying.
Well, if I had the skill to - at that time the special skill to teach someone as the part-time, that would be great, but in my case I guess  .
I always - now speaking - now I like group teaching or more like - because I like people, I like students and I like interacting with the different students and get the different opinion.
