A few weeks ago, a mother and her child are playing in a sandbox and then a man pass them smoking cigarettes.  The child was coughing profusely because of - because of the smoke emitted by that person.  Being the mother, she asked that person to tell him to stop smoking and out of guilt, that person stopped smoking and apologized to the mother.

I did back in high school.
Oh no, I don't have a part-time job now.
Well, it's because as the years go, as the years go by in my college life, things starts to get more hectic and my schedule is getting more constrained as time goes on.  So I am not sure if I could maintain my part-time job if I do it now.
Personally when it comes to teaching other people, I am more on the lower side of things because well, I do may know a lot, I - I tend to fail when it comes to telling that knowledge to other people.  I am not sure why, but it's just not my thing I guess.
What are the choices again?
Oh you mean, me teaching them?
Oh well, I guess I can teach some - some people at my home or at their place as long as it's - as long as there is not too many students because I tend to freak out and there is a whole lot of them to teach.
I - I think it's dependent on how that student handles their workloads.  Some of them are just I guess naturally well thought and they can probably spare a few of their times doing their part-time jobs, while others well, they are just like me who are less of a time constrained, so they are not forced to do it, so they don't try.
