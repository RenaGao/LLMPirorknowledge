Uh sir?
No sir.
Sir, uh, I, mm, doesn't feel that I should work part-time.
Or I should have part-time job.
I will try home tutor.
Because when we, uh, teach in a school, there are certain pol - uh, policies or instructions that are hired by the, uh, leaders - leaders of that school that we couldn't, uh, crea - we couldn't instruct the students that in the way that - uh, that results the students could create something.
The - the policies that are instructed by the higher authorities that only stimulate the cramming in students.
That's why I prefer home tutor.
Uh---
Uh, yes.
Uh, I don't think so that students should have part-time job. 
Because it affects the student's studies.
