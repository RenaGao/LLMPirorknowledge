Yes, so during college I worked as a sales assistant in a technical clothing shop.  So basically I had to explain to customers about trekking shoes and jackets and that kind of thing.
Actually when I - when I was 16, I was working in another - in that similar kind of company.  When I started university, again I decided that was just something I wanted to do to earn some money.
I would like to do group teaching.
I think with group teaching you get a lot of interaction and everyone can interact with each other and not just the teacher, and they can help see where each other's levels are and they can help each other improve too.
Well, I - I think it depends on the circumstances or generally I would agree due to money issues.
