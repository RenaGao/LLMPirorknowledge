No, I haven't.
I wanted to work part-time.  But my mom forbid me to do part-time.
If I have been given the chance to teach students, I would like to teach basic education, excuse me, specifically ah, for kindergarten students and preparatory students, because I think the, the biggest, the biggest skill or characteristic you will need there is patience and the knowledge is, it's just basic knowledge.
If there is a need financially, then I do agree.  But if the part-time job is getting in the, in the student's way in terms of schooling, I think it's better not, because I believe that college students are called students for a reason and they should only focus on studying.
