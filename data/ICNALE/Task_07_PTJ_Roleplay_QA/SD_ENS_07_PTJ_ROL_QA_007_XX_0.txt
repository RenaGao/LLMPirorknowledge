Yeah, I have many.
Yes, I did.
Uhm, well as a student I was a landscaper.  That's one -  one of the jobs.  Also I worked at a garbage bag factory, uhm, also worked in a mattress factory.
Uhm, one was the pay and the time, so I was able to do after school, yeah.
Yeah, it was a bit higher for a - for - for as a student from what I needed, so.
