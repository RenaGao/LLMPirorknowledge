Um, yes.  It - yes.
No.
Um, my part-time job, it's - it's like almost full time, but because I - I worked on - at when I have no class on holiday, I worked at Chulalongkorn University, and---
Just a normal stuff, you know, uh, at chemistry, I think at chemistry faculty---
I - it's just normal stuff, I do everything, every - that--- 
Yes.
Yes.
Because my sister worked there and they wanted some more stuff.
Yes, and I - I was free then, and I went there.
Uh, I would prefer at house - at home - at their home.
Because every learning I think that we have to concentrate more about what we learn and if we can talk to them, just like that it's nothing can disturb them, so it's better.
It's important for student at university to---
Um, no.
Because I think if - if you are - if you want - if you want to work, just work, but if you don't want to - it's - it's okay.  It doesn't mean that everyone has to work like, uh, if - if their family can afford - if their family can pay their tuition, so it's - it depends on them what they want to do.  So, it's not important to have.
