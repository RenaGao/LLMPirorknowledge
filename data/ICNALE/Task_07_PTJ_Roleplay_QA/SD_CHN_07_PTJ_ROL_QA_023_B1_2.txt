Okay.  Uh, of - uh, at first, I should, um, explain my situation, that is if I, uh, do not continue to do the part-time job, it is hard for me to - to live because my - my family is not very rich.
Uh, okay, but, uh, uh, if I continue to do part-time job, I - I promise I will, uh, reduce my entertainment time for - for - for doing more - for doing more research, so I - I don't think it will actually influence my, uh, time to do the research.
So, I like you to, uh, let me continue my part-time job.
Um, uh, but I do not like to borrow money from others.  I was to live on myself, so if - if - if, um - if - if teacher you have some part-time job for me to work with you and to - to get some money, I would like to do that.
Okay.
