 Me, no.
 Because I have to do many things.  For example, the college study and the study for my future.  So I don't have enough time.
 Yeah.  Sometime in the future.
 Uhm, I want to work in the flower shop.
 And the fruit shop.
 Because I, I like to speak   many people.
 I prefer home tutor.
 Because if I have to teach in the class, many students there.
 So, it is very difficult   look at each student but home tutor is - student is one or two.
 Yes, it is easier to teach.
 Yes.
 I disagree.  Because some people say part-time job is important to student because student can know, can know how to, how to - the way to work with many people but if student think   part-time job is too important they cannot do other important things.
 Student - I think student have to study.  It is very important and part-time job is not very important than studying.
