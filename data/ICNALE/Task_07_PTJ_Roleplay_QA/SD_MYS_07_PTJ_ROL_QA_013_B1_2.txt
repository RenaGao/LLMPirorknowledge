Worked part-time?  No.  I don't have the experience working part-time.
No.
I don't do any part time job at this moment.
I would like to try  b  but my parents don't allow me to do so.  So, I can't just - I am obey them.  Yes, I obey them.
Job.
A home tutor.
For myself, uhh, I like to teach in school because in school they have, uh, they have a schedule, schedule that I can follow strictly so that I will not be messing around.  For example, if I have - in - in school, I have a limited students, but if I am go for the home tuition or something like that, I cannot expect how many students that I will teach, and the cost.  The cost is the most important - important things for me.  I need to consider - consider it.  So, that's why I will prefer teaching in school.
Just agree or disagree or it can be both?
I agree that student that start their - in college, have a part-time job, because it can teach them how to manage time.  That is the first things for them.  And then, it can make the students to thinks further.  For example, like if the student, uh, have - have some job outside of the - it's study, work field.  So, it  can  boost their experience.  For example, like the experience from the work and the experience from their study.  So, in study, they can focus on getting a high grade, but in their works, they can focus and getting more money.  So, it can be calibrated.  When it calibrated well, they can be a successful men or women.
