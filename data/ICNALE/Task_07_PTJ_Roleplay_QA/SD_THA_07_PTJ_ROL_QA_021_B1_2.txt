Sorry?
Uh, I did, but actually I - I work - I don't know, is it part time?  Yeah, I did.
I used to be - I used to be teaching English, like probably 3 years ago I guess, during the summer before I got in the university.  I just worked like with the kids like on private school just teach English some basic vocabulary for basic conversation.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh, the school is still part time?
Right I understand.  Uh, I probably go to center.  That would be more, how to say more - more convenient for everyone, because like probably houses have so - if you have some place for work, that should be better.
Yes.
Yes.
I don't really agree with that one because I found like everyone have their own work to do.
In work in this case it means study.
And in each person, they have different work that they have to do.  And in some people were telling me, I - I basically work for - I basically study pharmacy and - and I also know a lots of another faculty also learn a lot.  But when come to me, I got a lots of activities, I got a lots of work to do, I got a lots of group - group project, so basically I don't really have time above that.  I didn't mean that I don't - truly didn't have time but I have to really concentrate on what I'm like doing for now.  So that I feel like - I feel like probably like part - if I do both at the same time, I probably not gonna do it efficiently as much that I can.
Yes, there's enough for survive, there's enough.
