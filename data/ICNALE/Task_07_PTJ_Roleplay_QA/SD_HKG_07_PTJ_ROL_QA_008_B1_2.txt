Yes.
Uh, no.
Uh, I was being, uh, a waiter in a restaurant.
I think, uh, being a waiter is challenging and it is important for us to deal with cust - uh, to know how to deal with customers, as many customers are, uh - have different perspectives and they have different ways to interact with others.  So, I think meeting with them - uh, meeting a variety of customers can, uh, let me have a higher EQ and have a higher, uh, communication skills when talking to strangers and talking to others to - and get what, uh, the - to get what the customers are going to order and - and what they are going to be served for the tables and so I can learn more for the - from them.
Uh, I prefer to, uh, be a home teaching or private tutor.   
Which, uh, I can - I can teach them in their own house.  I think, uh, one-to-one or face-to-face, uh, teaching progress is more efficient as I can, uh, know what, uh, my student is, uh - is not - not - is not understanding about and I can teach him more patienciously   and I am - it is easier for me to teach one student in a fixed time slot.
Uh, I strongly agree with that.
Uh, because, uh, participating in part-time jobs can help, uh, students to earn more money, uh, for them to withstand or maintain the, uh, balance of the income of the families.  For example, uh, some students may be come from underprivileged families so, uh, the - working as a part-time job, uh, worker can, uh, let them earn more money for their families and - and relieve the, uh, XXX   from the parents from being the, uh, main income from the, uh - for the family.
