Ah, yeah.
Ah-hmm, it was at a petrol station and then at a café and also like random jobs in the mall like café, mostly cafes.
Ah-hmm, for me doing like part-time job is very fun because I get to know people and also, ah-hmm, I get learn new things an example like when I worked at café - café I like I have to learn how to communicate with the people, with the customers. And then when I worked at petrol station, well also more with interacting with people and then at the famous - can I say the famous XXX   so I learned how to bake cookies.
So, it's fun for me.  All this a new experience.
Yeah.
Hmm, preferably the university students.
The diploma, I think the degree students.
Because I guess like the degree students are usually, not usually but I mean they are more, not more mature XXX   like for the diploma after high school then they will be like oh my god stuff like that.  So like maybe I'll - I want to teach like the students that really want to learn new things.
Yeah.
I agree with that.
I mean also it depends on the financial status of that person like if, ah-hmm, most of the people that I know are working because they need the extra pocket money so because like they didn't get scholarships or their parents they didn't give some like money - all that money to them.  So, they have to work for themself which I think is a very good quality because they know like how to earn money and I think they will cherish more than I am not saying that the people that their parents give them money don't cherish their money, but then people that work for - to earn their own money is more I think it's a good quality.
