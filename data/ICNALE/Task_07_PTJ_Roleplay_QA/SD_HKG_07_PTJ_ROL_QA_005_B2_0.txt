Yes.
Uh, not yet.
Uh, I've worked in Gucci as a fragrance part-time promoter and I have to sell some Gucci's new perfume because they - then - the customer may not know what the ingredients and what the smell about - is the - is the new perfume.  The new perfume it is so I have to introduce the new perfumes to them and then just mark down how many bottles of perfume I have sell a days and then I would get the salary and bonus.
Because that is a - even though it's not a very high salary, high pay job but I can only - because Gucci is a very popular brand I can only stand here and not talking and people will come to buy things, so--- 
---it was very interesting job.  I always talk to my, uh, colleague and they are very nice, that's the second reason.
Actually, I have tried before in--- 
---last year some---
---kids.  My secondary school is asking me to teach - help teaching English, and I only - I like teaching the senior or high school student because they are more clear or understanding what I say because I think the junior student don't know what I say because sometimes the term or something is more difficult and they can't understand it.  So if I wanted - because my job is to teaching them the - to teach them the English grammar so XXX   is very technical so I want - only want to teach the high level student so I - that's - I what - that's how I told my student then - and my teachers before and I only teach the year 4 to year 6 students - secondary year, 4 to year 6.
Actually, I agree with it because, um, because I - I am not sure if everyone is - thinks - is similar to me because I have to pay my own - the tuition fee here and I am now borrowing the money from the government, but I have to pay back in few years ago so now I have to save some money but - and, yeah, not always take money from my family so I use my own - I own money for traveling and for having lunch here so it's quite important to earn some money.
