Thank you very much.
Yes, I worked part-time.
I don't have part-time job now.
XXX 
Uh, my job I was doing before was a cleaning job.
I'm cleaning a building.  Um, it's, uh, like 7 o'clock at morning every day.
And 1 week is one day for, uh, not work.  And one day I work for 4 hours.
My boss was Japanese.
But the staffs half - half Japanese, half Chinese.
It's very a good job, very easy, very happy.
Because I - before I come to Kobe University, I was in a Japanese - a Japanese school.
Yes, and this job was at school tell me there is a job.
Uh, actually - uh, I - I want to do a teacher, uh, edu teacher.
Yes.
I want to teach at school.
Because, uh, you can buy that ticket.
Month ticket, is very easy to use at all.
You can take a particular bus or train.
So always the same train.
You can buy a month's ticket.
It is easy to get there and you don't like, uh, standard new home.
Uh, I think college student should have a part-time job.
Uh, study is very important but it's not the - all the same, uh, college student should do.
Because one day they will get out of university and into the society, they have to do work then.
So, they should now try to do some part-time job to get used to the future work.
That's very bad.
I think, uh, study is most important.
They should work but shouldn't work for, uh, longs - long times.
Yes, they should work with the not - um, not influence their study.
