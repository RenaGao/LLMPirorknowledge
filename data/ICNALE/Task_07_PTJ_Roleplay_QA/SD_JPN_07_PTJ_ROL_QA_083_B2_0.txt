 Thank you.
 Yes.
 Uh, I don't have now.
 Uh, okay, uh, I had experience of teaching uh in cram school.
 Uh, I can't earn much money than any other uh jobs.
 Hmm.
 Uh, I want to teach in school, not in their home.
 Uh, because in their home, uh, umm, the --- the atmosphere is very casual uh for teaching.
 Uh, uh, umm, for students, uh, some --- sometimes uh they need uh attention uh for studying.
 When --- when we uh get exams, it's, uh, for example, entrance exam, uh, it's very, uh, they will be very nervous when solving.
 So, uh, it's not good for students to study in a very casual atmosphere.
 Umm-hmm.
 Umm, I disagree when, uh, if they have much money.
 Enough money to live.
 Uh, because uh the most important thing for students is study.
 Uh, so this opinion says, uh, it's very important to communicate with uh people who are not in this university, right?
 Uh-huh, uh, hmm, we can have a chance to communicate with other uh per --- persons uh when uh if we join the club activity or uh there are so many chances to communicate uh with other persons.
 So, a umm part-time job is not only one.
 Uh, we can uh communicate with each other as I, umm, as I want, uh, maybe.
