Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Uh, I'm doing teaching after the semester timing, uh, as you can see at Tuition Academy Tech.
This particular job first of all this major with my prof - uh, liking profession because I like teaching, also it is near my house.  I - I can easily go to my home early because when I select the job from another place, we have to go - we need some extra time and as study also disrupt.
It is nearby my house.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
We like to home tut - tutor.
Because as in our country, it is most respectable thing as I think, parents give more attention.  When there is academy, student come, parent does not know when they are coming and what they are learning.  When we are providing studies at their home, uh, we will also feel some, uh, as we can say pressure or attention from the parents, so we can easily ma - manage this.
I agree.
When there is a student who is generating money from his own resources, he know better how to use it whereas most of the student does not know how money come, they only use it.  They don't have experience it.  I prefer there is some part-time job as they know how to earn it.  When they know how to earn, they will use it properly and earn this.
