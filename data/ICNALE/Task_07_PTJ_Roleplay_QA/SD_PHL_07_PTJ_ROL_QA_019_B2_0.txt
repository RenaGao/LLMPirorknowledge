Actually I just resigned from my job, previous job.  But I was a real estate, I was an employee in a real estate company.
One, because it's near.  I live ah, very far from here and that was like my sixth application and it was like ah, I was praying to get that job, because it was near.  And I was just so tired of going back and forth.  I really didn't care about the salary or stuff.  I just really wanted some job that's near.

A cram school teacher, because I did that before.  Yeah, I was a cram school teacher.
I actually agree, because I started, I, when I started a job, it was really hard for me to teach, because they were actually ah, looking for someone with experience.  And I think being a part-timer whether in college helps with that job, honestly.

And I guess I wanted a part-time job that would really get the employers look at me and like wow, that's right.
