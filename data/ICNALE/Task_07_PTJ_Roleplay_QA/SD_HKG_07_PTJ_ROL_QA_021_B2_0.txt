Yes, I am working.
Uh, yeah, in--- 
Because I work in UNIQLO.  UNIQLO is a Japanese company.  I think this kind of company is quite strict - strict because, um, you have to follow many rules, like, um, you have to greeting, uh, lively in front of the customers and then you have to, um, tidy or you have to, um - to make all rank into very good, I think it's a perfectly fine rank and then you have to, um, be polite with the customers and you have to memorize some specific rules, yeah.  And then I think, um, I have fun within this job because, uh, I made, uh, lot of friends in here and then they are willing to help me.  And then - and also I got a very good salary for me too.  So, um, I found it is a kind of good job.
Um, frankly because of the salary, and because, um, UNIQLO over 65 per hour which is a very, um, uncommon salary in Hong Kong and then - and secondly because of the location.  And UNIQLOs has many branches and one of the branches is in XXX   which - where is near my home, so it's easy for me to go to my workplace.
Yes.
Um, perhaps - perhaps private.
Because, um, for me I cannot teach, um, more than one children at the same time.  I think it's more efficiency when we, um, like face-to-face individual and I can spot what they do something wrong and then I can point their mistake immediately rather than I have to take care A and then I have B, C, D and it's kind of time consuming, and it's not efficiency and it's hard for them to polish their result.
Um.  It really depends what you need because I know some of the friends, um, they have a very good background like they are rich, so they don't have to work at all.  But for the others like - like me from normal family and you don't want to, um, increase, um, family's financial burden so you want to work.  So, it's really depends what you need, like you need, um, money for vacation or for your own need or for your own entertainment.
