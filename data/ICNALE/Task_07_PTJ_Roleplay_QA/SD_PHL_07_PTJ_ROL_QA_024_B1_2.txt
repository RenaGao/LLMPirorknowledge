I - during my 3rd-year college, I've been working in a call-center company.
Umm, because it is - it is offering high salary, and I really need money during that time.
It would be, go to the school to teach, because it is really a nice feeling when you're teaching face-to-face the students.  You could see their emotions, you could see that they're willing to - they're willing to listen to you and they're learning something from you.  So it is a very nice feeling when you felt   that one.
Yes I - it is very important especially for those students who could not finance themselves or who could not afford - whose parents could not afford them to go to school.  So a part-time job would be a big help to achieve their dream.
