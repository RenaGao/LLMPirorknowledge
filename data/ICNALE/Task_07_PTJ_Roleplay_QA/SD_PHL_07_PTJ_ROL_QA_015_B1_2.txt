Ah, yes.
I have a full time job now.  But before I had a part-time job.
I'm working as a real time analyst.
Well first, aside from it will help me improve my communication skills in my job, it allows me ah, to utilize the technical skills I have learned in school since we, we are sending different files and very ah, consolidated files and very technical files several times and it will help me improve my, my English skills despite my communication skills as well.
I would like to teach in a school since ah, for me, for you to become an efficient and effective teacher, you have to be in front of the class teaching the students, because students nowadays are different from the students before.  Ah, you have, you need to be able to persuade them for you to be able to, for, for you to able to force them to submit requirements and for you to be able to ah, teach them, well you have to be in front of them.  You have, they have to see the lessons in person.  They need to see the teachers, because students nowadays are distracted with different kinds of gadgets.
I'm sorry?
Yes ah, I think part-time jobs will also help them to be more productive and efficient, because learning is not just inside and for, in, in a classroom, in a four sided ah, four sides of the room.  Ah, learning is also, it also happens outside the school.  If you work, you learn the different ah, you learn different kinds of things.  You learn how to deal with different kinds of people.  You learn how to deal with different tasks in your work place setting.  So, if you're going to, to have a part-time job, you are also learning and that learning will also help you in the school.
