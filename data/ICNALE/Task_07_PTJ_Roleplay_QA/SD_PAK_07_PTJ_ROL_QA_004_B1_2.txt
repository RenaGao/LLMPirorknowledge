I have.
I have done teaching that after my classes I go for teaching.
Because somebody needs me to teach him.
I would rather like to try to teach in a school that it is a broader platform for a - uh, for the student to know things that it have conversation with other teachers which are more experienced than you that they would rather guide you and this will make, uh - this will bring more proficiency and more success to your studies.
I agree on that, that---
---university students should have job.
They should do jobs.  Because the university students are mostly from, uh, first three or two years mostly free, they didn't do anything about studies that, they didn't know about how to study and they didn't have much work.  So, they should do jobs.  And, in jobs they got more experience and more things they come across and they know more about world and how the people survive and about leaving, and about the practical life.
