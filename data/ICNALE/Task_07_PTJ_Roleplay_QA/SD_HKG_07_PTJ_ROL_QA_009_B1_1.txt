Uh-hmm.
Yes.
Yeah.
Um, so I only work for like 2 months and I only work 1 or 2 days a week.  Um, is - um, I work there as an waitress and then I love working there because like, um, the places is very beautiful, it's like the theme is marble and then, uh, I want to do something special bec - before I graduate so I choose to work there.
Um, because like I'm an accounting student so, uh, I have, um, work in some accounting firm and in the revenue department, it's like all career related so I - I think I won't do like the waitress after graduate so I choose to work there.
Yes.
Um, I will prefer the one-on-one teaching because, um, you can know more about your student and you can base on his or her situation to, um, assign her work and then to help her more.
Uh, I think it base on what they love to do because maybe some people will think that they - the four years of the university life is important to them and they want to treasure it to, um, have some fun with friends but because like you work, you also earn some money, you can support your entertainment and I think both of them is okay, just depends like what do you want to have.
