Yes, I have, like, during my semester break.
So, it's like a sales person, we--where I have to work at a shop, to, for 12 hours, where basically I would, see, be as, I would sell things before and I get paid daily.
Yes, it's a XXX  .
Now I don't have any because I am currently on my semester.
Yeah, because  .
Yes.  Because part-time job requires quite long hours, so to fill it in my current timetable it's quite - it's quite full.
Yes.
Uh, I think, I would like to try kindergarten.
Yes.
Because I think I, like, handling kids, many kids - many kids at once is - is not easy, so I would try to see if - I was put in such pressure and, you know, so many kids around me how would I behave, how would I react and how can I teach them?
I think, I would like to teach English because, I think, I don't know, but I think like, from kindergarten they learn A-B-C and, you know, how to - how to, they learn English from kindergarten, but then, I think, that is not enough emphasized on how should they express themselves on daily basis, even on simple - simple phrases on speaking out the - their needs or what they want.  So, if I would have the chance I would like to teach English in kindergarten, and have the kids to at least, uh, going back to speak whatever they want to have and to - for them, to have a better communication with their parents by using English.
Uh, I quite, to be honest, I think, I disagree.  Because this is not a must, it is a choice, like, it's a choice made by the person it's that if he decides to have a parttime job then he can have - he can do it, but he decides to not have one then he cannot have one.  It is not a must because financial state of everybody is different, so those that needs a part-time job.  So they need more money they can do parttime job like those that have a very comfortable and have - and already have enough, so that they might want to focus their time on something else that matters for them.
