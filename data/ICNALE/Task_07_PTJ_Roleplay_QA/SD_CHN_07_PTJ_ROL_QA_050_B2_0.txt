Well, I did a part-time job in - in an Internet company.  And I need to find different channels to build a part-time - uh, to build a business in relationship with our company and it is very - it was very challenging jobs because I didn't - didn't do this kind of work before and it helped me to, uh, gain a lot of practical skills, how to communicate with other people, so it is a very great, uh, experience for me.

I want to try to teach the students at their home because I think it can help me to teach them, uh, with more, uh, situation like I can, uh, teach them in my way and not in a very strict, uh, regulation in a big organization or at school, so I preferred this kind of method.
Well, I think I can figure out a very good way to encourage them to focus on my - on my work like I can give some, um, gift or something else to encourage them to finish the work.
I totally agree with this perspective because I think doing part-time job can, uh, help, uh, college student to improve their practical skills and at the same time they finally have to face the society of their graduation so part-time job can help them to know the society, um, before they graduation and it is very helpful for them.
