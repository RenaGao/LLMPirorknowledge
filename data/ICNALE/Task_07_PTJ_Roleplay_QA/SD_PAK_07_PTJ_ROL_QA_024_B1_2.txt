Honestly, I didn't work and not I am supposed to be.
Because my family can support me, so...
Yes.
I would prefer to teach at - at least at college level.
As a school teacher, obviously.
Uh, because at college level, you have to be a formal guy.  Uh, you have to be suited booted like a stiff-necked person and it's no - it improves so many habits.  So, and you know it - it - it gives you a lot of impetus in your future life.  So, that's why, uh, and above all you get a certain exposure from certain institutions.  So, that's why I would like to work at a college.
Students have a part-time job?
Uh, if they have opportunities, then they shouldn't work.  And if they are bound or if they are confined, then obviously they have to work.
