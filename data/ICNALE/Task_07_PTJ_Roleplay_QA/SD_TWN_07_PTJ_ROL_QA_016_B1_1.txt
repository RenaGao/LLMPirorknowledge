No.
Now I will not.
I need to take more time studying---.
Yes.
I want to teach - uh, tutor---
---at student's house.
Um, because I think, uh, these kinds of jobs is just for - uh, is - uh, is aim to help the student's work---
---and if - if I am the teacher, I will think that it is more helpful when study at our house - our home---
---for students.
I - I agree and disagree.
And I think - I think it's - it count on what you're studying and what the subject that you need.
Like, if you're studying, uh, business or - uh, business and I think it is needed to do part-time job.
For the part-time job can help you more - than more from the real society.
But if you - if you're studying like   - like - like maths - maths or chemical--- 
---I think part-time job will not be useful---
---for this kind of student.
