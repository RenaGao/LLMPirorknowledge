Uh, yes I did.
Yes.
Uh, I was working at a customer service desk at hotels.  It's - it's a sister company with JTB and it was only Saturdays and Sundays.  I worked weekdays during summer break when I didn't have any schools.  So I was just studying during week days and working on weekends.
Um, first, the very first reason was first to get a car.  So I didn't have to um, live off my parents.  I just wanted to be independent as soon as possible because I don't - both my mother and father are working and I know how - how hard they are working and I just wanted to relieve the stress.  And my little brother back then was still in elementary school and he was going to a private school which costs a lot of money.  So somehow I just wanted to help my parents out by working.
I actually did both in my life and so I would prefer teaching at a cram school.
Um, it's um, one-on-one is like you are not sure when you know you might lose that student or you know and is very unstable versus cram school is always a fixed day in a week.  So you know how much income you're going to get and it's easy to calculate.
It can work both ways but I would agree.  So they would - the next question would be.
I can continue, okay.  So because it - it gives them a taste of what life is, how hard it is to earn cash and you know what deductions they are going to get versus they go to a company without ever working at all and they don't have that knowledge.  So, it's a good chance.  And then they would know, I don't want to do this for the rest of my life and they are going to figure out that I need to get a better education because the part-time job usually is not something they usually desire or they like.  So it's a good chance for them to learn about the society and where - where they fit in life.
