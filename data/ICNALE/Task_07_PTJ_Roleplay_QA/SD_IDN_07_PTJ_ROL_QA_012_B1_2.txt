Yeah.
But only last for 2 days I think.
Yeah.
So, my part time was in like a noodle restaurant.  So it's, so I try to find more income from beside what my parents send me.
But, you know, it's really, really tiring and I - you know, I almost skip my class the next day because the night I have to work until around 12.  So, it's really, really tiring.  And after 2 days I say to the owner of the noodle restaurant, I said, I am really sorry, I have to quit, I can't continue this because I will - I am afraid it will really disturb my academic job.
So, actually I have ever been working in - as a tutor before in when I was in high school and also that's actually easier than you have to standby for the like a noodle restaurant or so, that's - that's much more easier.  And you must be already know the - the lesson or you just only have to share it to the - to the kids  .
---who learn to us.  But what I am afraid is that their parents have a big expectation over us - us I mean is the teacher.  So they really, really think they - that we can increase their kid's ability or their kid's grade as well.  You know, what we can do actually, we just share what we know.  And in the examination we can do nothing, it's up to the kids to do the rest.  Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Actually it depends on the situation.  If you really, really need money and your family or your friends can't help, then absolutely you need to be on a part-time job.
Yeah.
