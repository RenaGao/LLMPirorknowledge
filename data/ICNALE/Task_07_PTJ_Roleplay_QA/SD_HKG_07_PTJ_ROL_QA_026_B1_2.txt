Yes.
Uh, yes, currently.
Um, currently I work as a part-time waiter in The Steakhouse and in the past that last year I was a part-time tutor for teaching, uh, a primary for student.
Um, because I think that, and, maybe teaching students is much more - have more responsibility.  They have to be responsible for the student and also parents and it - and is - and - and it is much, uh, pressure and stress in it.  And also I think I may not be a good teacher and tutor that can teach the student much so I prefer to work as a part-time waiter to have less responsibility that - always with less responsibility and less pressure, just - uh, just perform my duty and everything is okay.
I prefer, uh, one-on-one the - the home tutor because just as the beginning of this - this conversation that I prefer that I can fully respond and listen to, and, other people in that conversation that, and I can keep my focus on it.  And when I go to a school environment it is a group of student or just even a school of more group it will distract me much and maybe it will affect my - my performance and also - yeah, affect my perfo - performance.
I will say that working as part-time job no matter whats the job is, it's, uh, teaching or not that, um, apart from, uh, in, uh dealing with people that have to communicate with people and also it changed your - it become your respond but - responsibility because as you are working as an adult that and you cannot just work - you cannot just, um, like in the past, as a children, as a kid, that - that everyone will - will, uh - will - will, uh, naturally go or understand your intent.  You have to take up the responsibility as an adult so this is how I manage from getting part-time job.  And, I think this cannot be replaced by other things such as XXX   we read that they cannot have this function of this and so I think if and the - if they can do the part-time job so it's - it will be good for them.
