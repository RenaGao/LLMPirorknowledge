Yeah.
Sure.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, working - when I worked on a language lab and the language lab was to help - to help the language department for various tasks.  For example students were doing like - they were doing all language project based and so they were creating projects called - some were called digital storytelling and um, yeah so my boss taught me the technical aspect of it like, also with - how it ties into the XXX   aspect of it as well.  Yeah.
Well because I had to do an English teaching.
No, no.  I wanted to become an English teacher.
And that was like directly towards my goal
Yeah, exactly
Yeah.
Right.
I didn't know that.
A-ha.
Um, based on the scenario or based on my experience now? 
Hypothesis.
I - I think now I would prefer one-on-one because my work is heading towards - towards that direction.
Because I am really interested in autonomous learning and that's reason why - my work, my whole research agenda and my work is heading towards autonomous learning and something called ���language coaching.'  So that's why.
Yeah.
Right.
I - I tend to agree.  No, I wholeheartedly agree.  I don't think college is serving the needs of population well nowadays.  I think um, part-time jobs give me you know a range of experience which I think is important and colleges don't do that and if it's talking specifically about Japan I think that's more so the case.  Yeah.
