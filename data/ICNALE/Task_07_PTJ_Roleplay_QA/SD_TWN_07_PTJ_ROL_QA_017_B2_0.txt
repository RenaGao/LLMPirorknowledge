Yes, uh, when I graduated from my senior high school, I applied for cram school for, uh, part-time job in my summer vacation.
No.
Um.  My work was, uh, mostly to call - to call - to dial some phone for the parents of the students in cram school.  So, we need to - we need to communicate with them in some academic rooms discussions such as this.
Uh, since - uh, initially I was - I was in favor of going to the restaurant to do some part-time job but, yes, uh, as the saying goes, men propose and god disposes, yeah, so, uh, finally I - I got a part-time job.  So, I have to do it for my summer vacation.
Oh, I forget to say about it.  I - I used to be a, uh, tutor teacher.  Yes.  So, I have experience tutoring others.  So, I see tutoring is more - is more - more need to - to overcome some obstacle when you face a student with not very nice academic performance.  So, you need to spend a lot of time to prepare for the teaching class.  So, I think - I will prefer to be a tutor, so---
Because its salary in one hour is really high, and you can earn a lot of money in a short time.  Yeah.
to apply for?
A part-time job.  If - if someone can apply for a part-time job means he maybe want to improve the skills in socialize with - socialize with people.  So, I think it's a good idea to work on a part-time job because you can learn the attitude that earning money is not really easy.  Yes, so you can - you can choose your what - what you have now.
