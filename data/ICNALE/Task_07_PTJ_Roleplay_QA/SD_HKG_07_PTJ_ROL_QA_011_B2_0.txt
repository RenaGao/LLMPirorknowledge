Yes, I have.  I have working - I have work - I am working in the, uh, science museum now, eh, as a part-time, eh, as a museum ambassador.
Uh, because, uh, one of my friends, uh, is working in, uh, the museum so, uh, he recommend me to apply for this job.
I'm sorry, can you pardon---
Um, I like teaching in group because, uh, um, I - I - I like to spend more time in, uh, different - different students, uh, um, with more student, uh, so that I can be more easy to - to compare their - their standards, eh, so I can better, uh, uh - I can better divide my time in helping, uh, rich student and, uh, so I can have a better, uh, management skills in helping them, uh, to - to, uh, study better.  But if I - I teach - I - if - if I need to teach in their home, eh, I think the time may not - may not enough because, um, it may disturb their, uh, family to - to in a - in the daily life, yes.
Um, I think it depends on the personality because, uh, some student really cannot, uh, focus in both academic and work, but for me I think it is, um, still affordable for me, uh, during year two, uh, I can, um, not earn money and, um, accumulate more experience during my day off.  I think, um, this ex - those experience can be also regards as a, uh - as one off - as one off - one kind of, um, learning because, um, I can use those skills in my, uh, future career or even, um, um, some projects or assignments and I can, um, acquire some unique experience other than my classmates, yes.
