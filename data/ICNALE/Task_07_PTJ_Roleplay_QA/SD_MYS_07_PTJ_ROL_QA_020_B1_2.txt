Um, previously when I was in semester one.
No, because I'm quite busy.
I'm working in a bridal boutique.  I help them fitting the customers, yeah.
For me, I would like to try and teach kids English because I love the language.
At school.
It is - I think if I teach at school, I can approach a lot of kids.  I would like - I would like to be a teacher personally, an English teacher when I was in school.  And, yeah, I think I want - my intention is to raise the spirits in learning English.
I think about that - I partially agree about that statement because some student, their parents can afford their tuition money, their tuition fee, the food and all but some students - as for some student, they only depends on the PTPTN and yeah.  So they have to - to adapt to the money for their students.
