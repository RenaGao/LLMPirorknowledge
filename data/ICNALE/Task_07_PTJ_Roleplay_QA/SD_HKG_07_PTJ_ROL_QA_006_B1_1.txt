Yes.
Uh, just recently.
Why I do the job?

Electronic--- 
Yeah, yeah, this - eh, the service is good and it's near to my home and time for is really XXX  .
Yeah.
Hmm, maybe, private teacher.
Because it is really hard for me to face a group of student because I am really not teacher, I can't handle lots of kids in front of me.
Hmm, I think it depends on which year.  I think when you are year one or year four, I am not really recommend to have a part-time job because year one you need to pick up your, eh, it is a new stage for you and you need to pick up all the things new and year four you nearly graduate and you need to focus on your work - eh, on your study.  And year two and year three I think you can have a part-time job for earning experience and earning money.
