Yes, I have worked part-time.
Hmm, no.
I used to work in convenient store.
I chose that job, because the - the real reason is standard store is just behind my house and I know the - the store's owner and he said I can stay here for just a few months and that's okay and I can choose any time if I want the convenient store.  It's really convenient for me.
Hmm, I learned, just in the situation before, I learned how to deal with the weird customers.  They will tell you a lot of strange requests and you have to - you have to deal with them.
Hmm, such as, oh, they got a bottle of alcohol and they opened it and they drink half of it, but they still come here and say they wanted to - they don't want it.  They wanted to give it to you back and they want their money back.  So, but you know they are drunk and so you have to tell them you can't do that, but you also have to protect them from their getting mad and it'll be very tricky.  So, you have to protect yourself.
I want to try the home tutor.
Because I think this is - this job is only your job, only yourself.  So, I think you can - you can better prepare what you should do and you can make a program for the student and you can do - you can do anything you wanted to do and you can do it by yourself.  You don't have to listen to other people to tell you how to do it.  So, I can try myself.
I - I think I agree with this idea.
Because part-time job can make you see this world outside from your academic study.  You can also know other ways in human's life, you can know.  Maybe, you can get a little look on your future job.
