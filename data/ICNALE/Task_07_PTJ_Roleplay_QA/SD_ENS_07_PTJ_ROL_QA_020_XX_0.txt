Yes.
Yes, I did.
Umm, I worked at a supermarket, local supermarket as a supervisor in the liquor and dairy departments, and I had about 3 or 4 people working under me.  Usually on - on a Sunday, I was in charge and also I've worked on a Thursday night, so just two days a week.
Umm, actually I chose that job - when I immediately finished high school, I needed a job because I decided not to go to university immediately after graduating, and I needed a job.  I applied.  It was near my house.  I got the job, and then 1-1/2 years later, I decided I wanted to go to university.  I was able to transfer to part-time work.
Right.
I would - now actually I would prefer to be a home tutor because recently - well in the last 6 months, I've been doing a lot of one-on-one lessons, and I really enjoy developing I guess a bond with that - with that student and really learning about how they learn and then using that information to try to create a better learning environment for them.
Right.
I think it is very important because I think one of the problems in society around the world is that people go to high school and then assuming they don't have a part-time job, go to high school, then they go to university, and all throughout this time they have just been in the academic world, which is very different than in the, I guess, working world you could say.  So then they graduate from university and then they join a company.  And yeah they might be academic smart but maybe not street smart, as we would say.  They don't know how to interact with people.  They don't know how to, maybe, interact with people that they don't get along with because they haven't had that kind of experience how to take orders, how to give orders, things like that.
