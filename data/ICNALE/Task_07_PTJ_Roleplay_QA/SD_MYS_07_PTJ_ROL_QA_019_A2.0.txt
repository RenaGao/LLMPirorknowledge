No, I haven't before.
No.
Uh, actually I want to go to have experience to work at any company or something other place near to my place but my parents didn't allow me to go, so I can't.
Really tutor home.
Yeah.
Because I think it's more comfortable and, um, I will prefer if the student comes my home and I will teach them.  Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I disagree.
Because I don't think this as a student like me as a student, college student can manage their time very well since we have a lot of assignments we do and we really need to manage our time very, very carefully and you have to have a schedule at what time and you need time for your studies like quizzes or test.  So I think this - I really disagree to student to have part-time job.
