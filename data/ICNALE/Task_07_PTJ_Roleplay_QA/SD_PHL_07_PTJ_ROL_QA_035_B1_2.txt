No sir.
Ah I don't really see the need of me having a part-time job at this moment.
What are the options sir?
I I think I will choose teaching in school because I like socializing with more people than than just at home and being just at home.
I disagree umm I think it really depends.  I think it's not really important for college students to have a part-time job to hav to have a part-time job.  I think it depends whether the students needs it or not because I think college students should focus more on their studies before looking for a job.
