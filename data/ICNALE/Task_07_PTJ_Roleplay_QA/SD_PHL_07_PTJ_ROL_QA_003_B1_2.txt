No.
Uh, because I - I live far away from my school and then uh, I think it would be a burden for me if I work after my studies and then when I get home I am already tired and I cannot do my school works.
I would like to teach at school so that I would be able to experience the school environment, meet new people and teach more uh, students.
I believe that it's okay if you don't have a part-time job.  Well, um, you applied for college school and you should focus first on what is the most important.
