But an internship.
Oh it is because I have studies and I would also like to focus more on - on my studies.
I would teach, um.
I would prefer to the place of my student because I am going to present to him the lessons or her, him or her the lessons at her place at her time, whenever she feels to study, I would be able to give out the lessons.
I think yes, they should have uh, job experience, but doesn't have to be something that would be a thing that makes them lose focus of their studies.  I think they should focus more on their studies because while their parents is funding for their education, they need to do more, they need to perform well so they have better opportunities and career.
