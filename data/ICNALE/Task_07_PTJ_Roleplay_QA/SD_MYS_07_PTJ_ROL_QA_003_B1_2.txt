No, no.
Well, I - I actually I was interested in it for a long time but my parents said that just - just focus on studying.  Let them handle all monetary needs.

I think I prefer home tutor I guess.
Because um, well unlike any other types home tutor has a certain degree of freedom for them to teach however they like and besides when teaching one by one it's easier for us to know if our students understand something and the pace at which they're learning and so that's why I think I prefer home tutor.
Yes.
Because ah, even for - for college students after we finish this study we enter the working work - work industry and as such I think it's better for us to be exposed early in our academic life, so that we're not really confused when we graduate from this college.
