Yes.  Before I was able to have a part-time job.
Ah it was actually done at home because I was teaching some elementary students, umm children of our neighbors who are having a hard time understanding their assignments, their school work.  So I am tutoring I am tutoring them.
Since I was able to experience home teaching, I want to try teaching in school, I think more students because like what I have said before, I like talking to group groups of people because I want to get ah more information, more opinions, more suggestions coming from different kind of people.
I think it depends upon the situation of the students because there are students who are really in need of money to send their to school and there are those who ah who are able or who have parents who are able to provide them ah money going to school.  Ah if it is really necessary for someone or for a student to to have a part-time job, I think there is no bad about it.
