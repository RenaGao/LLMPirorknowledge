Yeah.
Yeah, a lot.
Yeah.
Very special for me.
Yeah.  I think the most special one is that, uh, uh, is the one that I worked in a cafe, yeah. I learned, uh, how to make coffee and make all kinds of beverage and I think it is very interesting for me to learn all of these things.  Uh, although, I know it has nothing to do with my study and my major.  But, uh, I find it very interesting to do all kinds of things and when I did - uh, when I do all these things, I don't find myself caught watching.  So, I enjoy all this stuff, yeah.
Mm?
Mm, I can say the average.
About 6 hours, 4 to 6 hours.  Yeah.
Uh, no.
Very low.
Yeah.
Yes.
Mmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Mmm, uh, uh, I, mm, I want to try to teach in cram school.
Uh, because I think first it can, uh - it can improve my organizational ability because, mm, I once taught in, uh, children's house to, uh, try to teach the - uh, some English grammar and oral speaking that kind of thing and I find it, uh, quite easy because when you face only one or two students, uh, you can easily communicate with them and the class will be more pleasant, but when you face a lot of children, it is really difficult for you to organize your class and say, uh, try to - uh, try to teach them something, yeah.  But I think it is really good opportunity for me to, uh, improve that - uh, to improve my organize - uh, organizational ability.
Mm, yeah, so I will want to try it and say, yeah.
Mmm, yes.
Uh, I think.
Maybe it's because a part-time job can, uh - can help students to, uh, learn about a job situation in advance so that they can, uh, go into the society, uh, after graduation more fluently and more easily.  Yeah.  
Yeah, that's all.
