Okay.
Yes.
Yes.
Um, I am now still doing, um - being a part-time tutor, an English tutor only teaching English, not any other subject.
Um, and - but I am now moving from one education center to another.  Um, yeah - actually I enjoy teaching and - in that center because the students are actually quite - quite kid and they listen to me well and yes they are friend with me - yeah, they can be friends with me.  But then the reason I need to move the - to - to - to then leave the current company is because, um, they are trying to, um, let me to teach Chinese writing class and mathematic class which is I don't really okay with it.  So, um, I have enough with them, so I need to leave them, yeah.
Yes.
Uh, you mean why I picked this company or being a tutor?
Um, because I wanted to be a teacher and I am - my - my final target will be a English literature teacher in the secondary school, like teaching in NSS curriculum, the form - form - form 4.  Yeah, because there are less more - among the fewer student to learn English literature now, which I think actually is really good to study in secondary school.
Yeah, so I want to be a teacher and - encourage more people to do it.
Yeah.
Yes.
Actually, I have taught, uh, home tutor - be a home tutor before and now our education center tutor, um - um, I think in the teaching experience I would like to be a home tutor because, um, you can design a better, um, learning process for him and then you will see a better progress from him.  But then in the education center, you can only follows the XXX   that the center prepared for you and you actually do not got so many time to see their progress, you can just take all across - make across for them and make them to do the corrections.  And actually sometimes I think they don't really understand because they don't have time to ask me.  Yeah, we have got maybe 1 hour and 15 minutes only, but they are - they have so many question and they cannot ask questions in only - in a so short period and then therefore I don't think they have a really good proces - progress there, yeah.
Nine.
Yes, for tutorial class, yes a lot.
Yes, but depends on what you choose for your part-time jobs.  Because, um, I think in year one/two, you can get anything you want, like you can be a sales, you can be a waiter, you can be a tutor, uh, to get some experience from the job.  But in year three/four I think you have got a target what you want to do after graduation.  So, you may found some part-time jobs which can help to gain some really, um, special experience that can help you in the further career.
Yeah.
Oh yes.
Uh-hmm.
