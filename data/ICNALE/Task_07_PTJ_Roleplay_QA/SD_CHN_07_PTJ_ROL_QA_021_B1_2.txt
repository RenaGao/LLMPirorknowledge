Yes, I did a lot of part-time job.
Well, my first part-time job is cafeteria just near my house, and I usually cleaning the table after the - or guests left and trying to prepare the - the meal.  I have to prepare the meal and take them near to my XXX .
Well, because it's my first part-time job, and at that time, I cannot speak any Japanese so just do it.  And my, uh, another job - one is my - I'm doing it right now is in the supermarket just in Hankyu station, uh, supermarket.  And I try to, um - I - I want to be a XXX , but my - my boss said because I can just working at night, and the boss said, at night, there are some - some guests that will buy some drink, and they are very tough to handle and you are young girl. It's too dangerous for you, so - and, uh, he - so recommend me to work just in the - um, another room of the supermarket, so I'm preparing the vegetable.  I cut them and pack them and put them into stuff.
Uh, I would like to teach a class of students.
It's because when I was in China, I had the both of them.
If you teach - teach child in his or her house, their parents will give you lot of pressure and give you, um, lot of press---.
No.  No.
Yeah.
And if this thing, you're not doing very good, they will reduce your salary gradually.  So, hmm.
Of course, I agree with it because when you're doing the part-time job, you can know - something you cannot know just in college about this - uh, about social.
Well, for example, when I was doing part-time job, I, um, got to know some friends from other schools, different department, and it surprise me that we think in a very different way about something and that really inspired me and made me thinking about something.  I think it's good.
