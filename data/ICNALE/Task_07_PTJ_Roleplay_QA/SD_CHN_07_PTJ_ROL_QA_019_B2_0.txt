Yes.
Uh, I did, uh, waitress and, uh, okay, a waitress again, and now I am doing translator.
Uh, when I first come - uh, came to Japan, well, uh, two-and-a-half years ago, uh it's not really easy to find job as my Japanese was not so good back then.  And I - I got three interviews but, uh, I have been rejected by two of them, and the - and also as a waitress, you can - you don't have to worry about food.  You can get lunch; you can get dinner there.  And then, uh, when I moved to Kobe, I think I had - I can do more than just waitress, and so I applied for my part time job now as a - a translator and also, uh, I pay XXX  to foreigner customers.
Uh, I think I would prefer, uh, a home tutor.
Uh, actually, I've been done tutoring - tutoring back in college, but I, my students are primary school students and it is one to one, um, two times but one to one, yeah.  And I think I, well, um, my students wants to learn uh, well, if in Japan my student wants - wants to learn Chinese or English, but I have to explain it to him or her that, uh, in Japanese. 
So, I think, uh, if I can explain it in Jap - in Chinese, maybe a lot of students would be okay, but in Japanese I don't, I - I'm not that confident.
Uh, I will agree with it, but, uh, you have to choose, uh, um, the part time job not randomly.  Uh, because, um, it for, um, local students, uh, as - as I hear it for, uh, Japanese students who do some - uh, do, uh, something like waitress or, uh, um, just something like that, I don't really recommend it, because it won't do you any good.  But as for me, I can speak to Japanese and I can learn, I can - um, I can improve my Japanese, and as it were, uh, I - I think it's better that, that we choose something, uh, not only for money but also we can learn something by the job, like, uh, sight - sightseeing guide or something like that.
