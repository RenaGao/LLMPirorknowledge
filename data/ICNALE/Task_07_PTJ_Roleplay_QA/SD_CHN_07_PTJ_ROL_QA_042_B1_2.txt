Yes.
Uh, supermarket.
First, it's - it's very easy to find it because, um, during the, uh, winter vacation, mm, mm, supermarket, uh, will - will have a lot of people to go and they need to - they need to some people to sell - sell some pro - product for - for them.
About 150 yuan a day.
Yeah.
Mmm, maybe 6 hours to 7 hours.
Yes.
Yeah.
I think maybe the second one.
Yeah.
Uh, because in organization, so surrounded of this job is more - is better and I can learn more skills, uh, in this job.
I think if you teach there - teach something really interesting or is really helpful for them, they - they must listen to you, so - so if they - if they don't listen to you, it may be your problem.
Because I think it may be something but because on the internet, often - often appears some bad thing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think different people have different opinions.  Uh, not everyone is suited to do some part-time jobs when they study.  If there is really good - good opportunity or you - you can have a balance on the study and your job, it is better to try.
I think I will try to persuade him to quit the job and focus on for study, but if - if - if she - she still - still don't listen to me and me says took her job, I think it's her - it's her - it's her choice and finally when we - when she have some other things, she may be - she may be quit her job in herself.
