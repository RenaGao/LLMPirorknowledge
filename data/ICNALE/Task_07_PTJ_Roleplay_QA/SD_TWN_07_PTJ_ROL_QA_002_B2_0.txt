Uh, no.
No.
Uh, no.
Um, because I have enough money and I think part-time job is not that helpful for me, because my job, um, after I graduate from school, um, maybe they'll need that skill, um, then I can learn from part-time job---  
---to, uh, for my job, my uh, superficial is more important than, hmm, take a part-time job.
Um, I will, hmm, teach at home.
Yeah.
Um, because, hmm, at cram school, I'm just, um, uh, little role in the cram school and maybe, um, if I do well or do bad, it doesn't matter that much.  There are still many others, teacher.  Um, but when I am a home tutor, um, I am, um, one to one to my student and if I can explain the, hmm, I can teach him or her well.  Then, the effect may be very bad.  And, uh, the students' parents may be very mad at me and that pressure may make me improve my, uh, teaching skills.
Um, I think that depends.
Uh, if your work after you graduate need that kind of skill, then it's important to have a part-time job to learn something that you can't learn from the books.  But if your work don't need that, for example, dentist and doctors maybe don't, um, their, hmm, skills in medical, uh, is more important than that and it's more important to, uh, put our effort in studies now.  So, I think that depends.
