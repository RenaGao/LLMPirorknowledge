One of those jobs would be - there were some interesting one - Uh, working in a chemical factory.  So when I was - I was a student, so even though it was a liberal arts course of studies, so teaching and history, so like the chemical factory, that is totally - totally different.  So but, yeah, so unlike the previous example, not really building up on any kind of  
Okay.
Oh, it was nearby and the scheduling was - was good, so kind of after class a few hours so  
A short-term.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me see, I would say the cram school will be better as something that's official and - and you could show to - to on a resume to an academic source.  You know, the other home things would more kind of an under the table unofficial type thing.  It would be harder to get references from that, those are not - not as formalized and - and supportive to a long-term development.
Okay.
Yeah, I think so.  I think that if you start your job search just after university with only academic experience, that you will be at a bit of a disadvantage.  As it seems like a lot of people are disoriented coming out of academics and going directly into - into the working field without any kind of like clock-punching experience.
