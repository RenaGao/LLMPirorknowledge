No.
Never.
Because I'm afraid to train.  Because for me part-time, uh, for example, uh, for example, at a, at a store at our university, they are hiring for part-time.  But I have a time actually, but I'm afraid to communicate with the people.  I'm afraid that I'm not going to handle them, uh, nicely and I'm afraid of maybe the financial, the finan- how to finish the financial, yeah, something like that.
Yeah.
Yes.
Maybe for a tuition teacher.
Because, first of all, because the kind of payment and after that, uh, when I'm doing tuition, tuition teacher, uh, and I think it is more free than school, more private.  You know, you have, you have a space and you have a time to communicate with your students and your students can ask you freely without, you know, because I like to teach my students where I enjoy, to enjoy and then not to stress about education, about the subject that they are studying before.
So, I think, I'm, so that is the is the merits of what I'm choosing tuition, tuition teacher.
Of course, English.
No.
Because, you know, some students can't handle their time properly.
And then, yeah, it can cause, uh, it can affect their studies.
And then, uh, you know, like some people, uh, some students, when they started to work, they are going to work all the day and they are going to you know, ignore their study because they're going to have a mindset that money is important than studies.
So, if they have a mindset like that, everything is going to be worse.
