No.
Yes.
Umm because my mother and my father has a stable job and I think and they won't let me to have a job unless it is needed or it is a requirement in school.
Umm tutor.
At home because umm tutor at home because I I will in a way it will be more comfortable for the relationship of the student and the teacher.  And it gives us more privacy and time to talk to each other than in school.
Umm I disagree because it just just like the situation earlier umm it affects the student's the student's time and time management and it also and also the studies the part of a student in the part of a student as a student in the school.  So I think it is not appropriate for a student to study to work.
