As a student?
No.
No.
Well, after I graduated, I actually moved here and I got like - I was working for two part-time jobs.
Well, one is - my first job was an ALT for a high school, and since they only work two days a week, so I got another job at an EIKAIWA  , so I worked there for three days, so that makes it five, so---
I taught English.
Well, because actually it's the most convenient job for me.
Because I already know English and I don't really - and I'm just planning to save, so yeah.
Hmm.  I actually like teaching, like - like one on one.
Because you can get to know your student more, so you can think of like what conversations to practice, and you become, like, comfortable with each other, so I like it better.
Well, for me, it's depends on your financial status, like---
Yeah.
Because I think - yeah, in other cultures, like, that's like the thing, when you're in college, you work.  But I grew up - in my university days, I - I was in the Philippines, so our culture is different.  Like my parents, our parents, like, pay for everything until we graduate and get a job.  Yeah, so---
Yeah.
