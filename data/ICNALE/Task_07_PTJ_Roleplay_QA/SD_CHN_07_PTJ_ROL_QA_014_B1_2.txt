Thank you.
I have no - no---
No - no.
Uh, why I cam - sorry, sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Actually, I tr - I try - I tried it before, um, in Osaka but when I came to Kobe University, the study is very, very hard so I have no time for part-time job.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, maybe, I want to go to student's home to be a home tutor.
Because actually I - I graduated from normal university and we are to study - uh, we are to - to - yeah, and in there many teachers---
---from there, so and when I in - in my university and I often do that - did that job, so - so that's why I want to continue to do that.
Agree to---
I think it's up to the situation, the - um, the people's situation, maybe someone it's really, uh, poorer and - and - has no money to continue study.  I think that's very important to him - to - to them.  And in another case maybe someone want to practice then their Japanese - like Japanese skills or something.  I think that's a very good way to, um, practice skills, soci, um, including social - social skills, uh, also others.  But in some other case, uh, like someone, uh, has enough money and I think that's maybe the study is more important to the job.
