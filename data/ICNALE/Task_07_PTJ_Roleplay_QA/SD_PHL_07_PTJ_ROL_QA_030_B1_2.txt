No, not really I haven't really tried a part-time job.
My pa and my father really don't want me to have some distractions whilst studying here in Manila.
 I would prefer tutor because umm - because I really - when teaching and when helping someone to study, I really want to focus only on them because when it's in a group work, I really can't handle the disagreements and the riot when they're not - umm, when they're disagreeing on a topic I really can't handle to make a point.
Umm, I agree that it is good because - umm, studying in college really - umm, expensive your - there are a lot of things that you're - that you need money for.  So umm, having a part-time job actually helps you when - for an extra income and extra source of money.
