Yes.
Yes, I did.  Actually I worked part-time during my, uh, year one, because I wasn't really busy and I think, um, I could make some money at the same time, so I worked at a trading company at Hong Kong.  Uh, I worked around 15 to 18 hours a week.  Uh, it is a good experience but - but as my study also on - in year two and now I am in final year, I am too busy to really, uh, move time to work part-time really.
I - I am not working at all.
At the moment.
Uh, the reason why I chose it, oh, well actually, uh, my family found it for me and so, there - there I am.  I worked there for a year and I realized that my study actually got so, uh, my timetable was actually quite filled up, so I don't really have time for the job anymore.  And so, for my good and for the com - uh, company's good I, uh, decided to quit, yes.
Uh, if I were to teach I think I will actually prefer, um, individual because I can get to know the student more in a way that, uh, my teaching is specifically targeted at the student's ability, what he doesn't know or what he knows.  I can, um, set up a teaching plan just personal - personalize it for him.  And I think for the good of the student I will actually prefer to teach a single student at home, even though it might not be as efficient in terms of time course and, um, the money you received.
I think it really depends on your focus.  Uh, so when I was year one, I feel like I - I could have the time to do - to do a part-time job and I - there I am, I went to work part-time.  But then as time goes on, I get more busier and, uh, in my study and I think that's just really depends on what your personal goals are.  If you want to work a part-time job, go for it, if you - that - that being said, you have to be able to balance your study and your part-time job.  Whereas, for me, because I am pursuing a master degree later on, so I decided to focus on my study first at the moment.
