Okay.
Not part-time, maybe full-time.
Yeah.
Shopkeeper.
I am being a shopkeeper.
Sorry!
Because when I graduate from my senior high school, I have a free time around 1 month and I try to find how to - how to decrease my boring time and I try to apply - apply a job and that's job shopkeeper.  So, I - so I XXX   I apply.  Yes I applied that job and I am being a shopkeeper.
Yes.
I want to teach at school.
Because I - I - I have ever to teach in my home and it's really, really - or it's hard for me to suit my time with my other activities.
I don't think so.
Or I think it depends on the students.  For me it--- 
It is not important enough but it's not - it's important enough because I take the middle of the two choice that.  Because in some of students maybe the study - studies is really boring.  So they try to improve their experience through the job, the part-time job.  And for me because I really like and I really convenience - I really - sorry, I really comfortable to the - to be studying - student.  So I really like to study and I think that part-time is the second - the second choice.
Okay.
Okay.
