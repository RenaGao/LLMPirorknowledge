Because you can get closer to the student because you know what - know things from them, his behavior and his studying attitude, and what he usually do at home.  If you know something like familiar and know better, then you will know how to design a specific work - study plan for this student.
Maybe two.
And because my - I had to - I had to keep my grade up and at the same time I can only offer time to teach two students.
Uh, it depends---
---on the students, uh, studying ability because if the - the - the lesson is just too difficult, and the student maybe should consider to work hard on study.

I think he should - he - he should work.
Yes, should.
Because working can help you gain experience from your working routine and anything you experience will make you successful in the future.  Maybe not, but you will become more, uh, experienced and can handle a lot of things that you cannot imagine before.
