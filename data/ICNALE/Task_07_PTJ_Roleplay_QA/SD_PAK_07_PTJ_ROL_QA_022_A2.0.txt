Uh, no sir.
Actually sir - actually sir my family is supporting me and they are giving me as much money as I need, uh, in my, uh, university life so that's why I don't prefer working part-time job.
Yes. 
Uh, I would like to teach in tuition - home tuition.
Because that is, uh, uh, mm, not belonging to any institutions like schools or colleges, uh, I will just be going there and teaching them and then I will be back at my home and there will be no attendance and this or so.
Hmm, I disagree.
Because it - if you are working part-time job, so then you have to give them work time and it will waste your time and it - it - it can affect your studies because your attention will be distracted and you cannot be, uh, mm, focusing on your studies because you will - you will be thinking about that, um, uh, home tuition or part-time job too.
