Yes.
Uh, uh, several jobs.
Impress me, uh, it's - it's hard to describe, uh, uh, it's a job, uh, yeah.
Uh, it's a job to, uh, show a machine and the machine is used for, uh, recycle smartphones and my - my - my task is to, uh, how to say lead people to use that and accomplish the - uh, the process.  Yeah, and it's the - they even gave me a T-shirt, a green T-shirt.
Yeah, for the company and, uh, it's - I think it's not a - precisely it's not a hard job because I - I just stand in a - a shopping mall and a lot of crowds, uh, went by and introduce the work I'm doing and tell them they can get their Smartphones, uh, yeah, retire their Smartphones in - in - in the box.  And some staffs after they get the money and the - the machine.   Of course, the company get Smartphones and then everyone will be happy.
How many hours?
Uh, let me think.
Eight hours.
Yes.
Yes, yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Yeah.
Uh, I would like to be a - a - how to say, tutor.
Home tutor.
Yeah, I think it's more flexible time for me, especially I have classes in school, maybe we - we can, how to say, negotiate - it's not negotiate.  We can discuss a suitable time for each other and decide how even XXX   class and even the places, maybe his place, his or her place or maybe some caf�� and so they are okay for me.
Yeah and they are pretty well, I think.
Yeah, I agree with that.
Uh, because it's an experience for each of us.  And, uh, how to say, tech - technically I didn't have a part-time job in - in college time, but before that I have several part-time jobs, so I think I should have a part-time job recently.
Yeah.
