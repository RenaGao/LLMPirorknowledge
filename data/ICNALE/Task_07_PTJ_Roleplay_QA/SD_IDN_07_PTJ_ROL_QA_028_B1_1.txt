I have.  I have work.
It is only a cab driver and like a volunteer in EO an Event Organizer and some charity work. 
Yes.  Online Taxi Driver.
I would like to try to teach in the privately because-- 
At student house. 
But first it is not a student house but maybe I feel like more comfortable with an open, in an open caf�� or a public library workplace.  Because if I do it in privately in his or her room then it would make people uncomfortable.  And why I choose home tutoring rather than public tutoring?  Because I easily discourage when I have to speak in front of the public, especially when I have to speak - public speak - publicly speak in front of - in front of strangers. 
I am sorry, can you repeat? 
I agree - I agree for a work for the work experiences because it is different between a campus life and work life.  You have to understand work life - work experiences because after - after you - after you graduate from the campus then you have to attend or applying for a job which requires work experiences.  And the offices - they like people with work experiences.
