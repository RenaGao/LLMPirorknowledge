Not yet.
No.
I haven't tried part-time but I have already tried to make products.  So, I don't think that I need part-time because I can make my own products.
Yeah.
Home tutoring.
Because I have lot - so many cousins and most of them still younger than me and I love to teach them how to study and mostly my aunty or my uncle feel really thankful for me because one - one is I love to teach my cousins and second, I am free.  I mean, you don't have to pay because it's just my cousins.  And then third one is usually their score become better after I teach them because they said that study with me is fun, so I love home tutoring.
Oh yeah.
I disagree.
Because at this moment we have to make our own products because instead of being a worker, we have to make our own products.  I mean like, we can somebody to work with us.  It's better than we work to   someone.
Yeah, we have to be entrepreneurs  .
Yeah.
