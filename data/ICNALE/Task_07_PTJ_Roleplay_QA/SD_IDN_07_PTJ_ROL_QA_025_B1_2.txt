Uh, I am sorry?
I have but I don't have it in a long time.  It's just 1 month.
Ah, yeah.
Uh, I have to make a content of a website, there is some content about the pharmacy stuff and then I have to make it hosting the website weekly.  So, I have to think the content alone and I have to make it help the viewers.  I have to gain the more followers, something like that.
Hmm, yeah  .
Just the content.
Uh-huh.
Hmm.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I think I have to try in a home tutor I think in a private session.  
Because I think I can - I can teach student with privately like private home is more uh more persistent and then I can know how can they hmm how can they?
Yeah the progress, yeah the progress of the student.  I have tried once, I have with my friends a student and then I feel like I can do it long but I cannot continue that because I have problem in transportation.  I have no transportation in here so I cannot try to do it.
Uh, I think I really not agree with that statement  
Because I think to start a part-time job we have to manage time, we have to think about the risk and benefit of the part-time job.  So, when we start a part-time job we have to think about a lot of stuff and for me it's I think that's not a really important one for now.  But I want to try it if I have a chance.
Hmm.
