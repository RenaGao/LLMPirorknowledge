Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I - I - I work in a translation company and it - it - I have to handle a lot of translation things, uh, across many fields, yeah, I have to work on - I, uh - business like law and, uh - and maybe like something, uh, creative media related, yeah.  So, uh, work for a lot of company, maybe like IKEA, like, um, art things, uh, LV, a lot of things, but it - it - it is pretty hard because I - I have to know things across many fields apparently so as to translate those kind of word, so, uh, it's a pretty bad - it's a pretty hard job, so I don't find it interesting too.
Well, I - uh - I studied translation so I guess it would make sense to choose a job that - that's related to that.  So, I need experience for - for - for, uh, getting job by this in the future.
Uh, I will try - I'm sorry for scores and---
Uh, I mean, uh, I guess, for school - for school, right?
Right, uh, yeah, uh.
Oh - uh, I get, uh, uh, I just - I guess just one child, I can just handle one child at a moment.
It's - it is headache, yeah.
I agree.  I mean, uh, we learn in a college for - for working in future.
So, we're pretty much just, uh, one step forward into those thing - it is - to society in the future, so I mean you have to accumulate experience for that.  So, yeah, you should work in a part-time job.  And - and also part-time job to just how to be a normal human being, how I should put it, uh - yeah, I - I wasn't really normal back then and did - didn't know how to communicate with anyone.  So working in - in - in a part-time job to just know how to be a normal being really.  Really.
Uh-hmm.
