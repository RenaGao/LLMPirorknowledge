Yes.
Yes, I do.
I am a student assistant in my university.
Yeah.
I often encode grades and deliver uhm, confidential documents to different departments of the school.
Because it's more convenient than any other part-time job unlike when I am going to work outside, I need to go to that particular - particular location instead I chose this so that I'm still within my university's premises.
I think I would like to try the cram school teaching because it's already at my university and I wouldn't have - I wouldn't also have the time to go to the students' houses.
I think that it depends really on the need of the student.  If you are financially capable, I guess, you wouldn't need a part-time job because you are financially capable.  And - but I think it's really great whether or not you are financially capable to have a part-time job because it allows you to be more uhm, prepared for the work, the real workplace and it allows you to enhance your skills as an employee.
