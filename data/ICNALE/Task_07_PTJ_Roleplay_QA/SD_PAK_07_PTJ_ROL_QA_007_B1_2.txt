Uh, yeah.
Yeah I do tu - tuitions.
Yeah I do tuitions.
Okay, I do tuitions for the primary level students or secondary ninth standard students.  I taught  them, uh, different subjects you know, Maths, English, Sciences as well so you know after university timing.
Yeah.
Sir, because it's in my, you know, uh, um, in my you know, uh---
You would say---
Sir, I think it's, uh, I can do it better because it's - uh, various children, uh, came - uh, come to my home and it's easy for me to handle my university with the tuitions.
So, if I choosed another one, I would, uh, have to manage all the time - all the things.  In home, I - I manage my home and my tuitions children and my university work as well.
Yeah, yeah.
If I'm not a student - if I'm not a student, I go with the school teacher definitely.
Because definitely, uh, I know I want to be a profession in this field.  If I am doing teaching, I - I want to be professional.
So, you know, home tea - home tuitions is good for children but you know it doesn't make you professional.
I agree.
Because, you know, at university level students are much, you know, older in their age and they have to be focused on their future so if they have a time for part-time job or they have - if they got that type of timing at university, so they should definitely do something for their future securance.
