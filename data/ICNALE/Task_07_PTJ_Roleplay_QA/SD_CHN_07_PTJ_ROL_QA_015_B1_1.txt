No.
Yeah.
Umm, uh, actually I want to do some part-time jobs but in China I have no chances.
Umm.  Uh, there are many things to do for studying for---
---for my family.  So I have no time.  Yeah, and in Japan I think, umm, eh, eh it's real - it's really can improve my spoken Japanese, yeah, and I can try to know more people and---
Yes.
I - I think I want to try the home tutor.
Um, because in a class man - there are many students and you - you - you can't - you can't - you can't ensure everyone can - get the knowledge or - so maybe if I am a home tutor I can ensure the student can know, um - can know what I am talking about really.
Um, I - I think so.  I think part-time job is important.  But I think the most important thing is the student should know what he really want in the future.  Maybe, the part-time job is - is important for his work in the future but if he doesn't want to do work after he got out of the college maybe he wants to study more, and I think he should do more study in - in the lessons or something. So - so the - so the time for the part-time job is more important for his study maybe.
