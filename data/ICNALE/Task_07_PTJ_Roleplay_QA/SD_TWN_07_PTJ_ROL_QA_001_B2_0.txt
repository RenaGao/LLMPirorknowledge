Yes.
Not now.
Um, I - I was working as a librarian, uh, so I part-time in the school's library.
Uh, the - uh, the work, uh, content includes like return books and - and - and show them the directions and check the student miss, uh - miss something and like - like missing umbrella, like help, help them find them.
Lost and found.
Not really, uh, because I don't really like to talk to - talk a lot, because, um, but however, the uh, the librarian job requires talking to strangers a lot.
Not really.  Uh, well, I think the - I think the things I don't like about is mostly because they repeat uh, at like - they repeat the question over and over again just like they don't ask you something new.  They always ask you something that is, uh, that you already know and  
Like yeah and I, sometimes I feel like I'm the robot like I repeat the things over and over again within a day.  So, it's really exhausting sometimes.
Oh well, this job really suits me I think because - probably because I - I love reading books and working in a library, I can - I can read much as I want.  So, uh, within 2 years working in library, it's probably the time I've read the most.
Um, oh well, I - oh, um, I used to, um, do the home teaching job.
Tutor job.
I prefer, uh, tutor job, because, uh, first of all, I don't really like cram school and second, and - and secondly, I think tutor job, uh, is much easier and usually the parents will come into the room and give you some fruits.
Um, yes, I agree.
Uh, maybe, um, I partially agree only if the student - only if the part-time job will not take up much of the student's time.
In that situation, I would agree, uh, because I think it's really, uh, I mean it's really important to communicate with strangers and communicate with other people.
