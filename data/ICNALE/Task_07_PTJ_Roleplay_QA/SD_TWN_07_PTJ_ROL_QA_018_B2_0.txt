Um, yes.  I have worked part-time - oh, no.  I worked part-time when I was in senior high.
No, I don't have.
Um, I was working in the cram school and the job is pretty easy, just in the summer vacation.  And I just, um, go to the cram school and call someone I know, maybe my friend or my classmate, and to ask them whether they want to do a part-time job in the cram school.
Um, because I was in second grade in senior high at that time.  And our club need - need to - uh, need to - need money to make some activities.  So, I went there because my club, uh, president knew that.  So, she introduced me to go there.
Uh, I think, yes, because many senior high students worked there too.
Um, I want to try home tutor because I think to teach in the cram school is much more tiring because you have to face with many students and you don't know what questions they will ask you.  But, uh, being a home tutor, you only need to face with only one student.  You can know all the things about the student whether that student is good at Chinese or math, and what part you can help the student to improve.
Yeah.  I agree because college students have more time than senior high school students, and I think college time is a good period of time for students to know more about the social or the society.  And I think do a part-time job is a good way and a good assess to - access to the society.
