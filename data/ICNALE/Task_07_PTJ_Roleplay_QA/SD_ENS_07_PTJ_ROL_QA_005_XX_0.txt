Part time job?  I worked in the summer when I was in college at a golf course  
Student?  No.
While I was in college, it was over the summer, so I was not in school at that time.
Uhm, working as a groundskeeper at a golf course.
So I woke up around 4:30 every morning, weekdays, and went to the golf course, mowed lawns, mowed greens, just did odd jobs, clean up the golf course, and...  
Because I love to golf.
Yes.
You know, which of the teaching---  
Uh, maybe the tutoring, let's say.
I have a little bit of experience in tutoring. After I graduated college, and I - I - it's, I feel like it's more effective.  At least I'm better at it.
Uhm, I think it teaches responsibility, so I think it's a good thing for - for most students.
Though, I - I guess it would depend on the situation.
