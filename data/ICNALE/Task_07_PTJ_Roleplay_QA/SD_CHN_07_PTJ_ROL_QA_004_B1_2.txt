Okay.
I used to go to a restaurant in Japan and I used - I worked in the kitchen because at that time, my - my Japanese not very good.  I can barely talk to others and understand what the others are thinking about and so I just get the works to wash - wash dishes and cook rice.  But - but when I - when the work is going on, I get my - my - my Japanese is more - is good and then I - then, um - and then the job - the job is not - is not suit me very well.
I cannot - I think that the job is very tired and I cannot gain other - anything from it just tired - tired, so I give up the job.
Home teacher.
Because - because students are very - very - students - too many students may make me confused.  I don't know how to conversed  on this.  One student makes me - one student means that I can ju - just need to converse on him and what him thinks - what he is thinking, what he is doing, I can just get control but too many students means that I should - I should watch all the students at one time, this is very hard for me.
I agree with this opinion.
Uh, because with a part-time job, you can get a - some money to do what you want to do.  Just like the - the man before and with the part-time job, you can get yourself gained a lot of experience.
And you know that money is not a - a simple - a simple thing that you can get.  You may find money is very - it's very important and you should try a lot but not try a lot to get it but not to spend it easily.
