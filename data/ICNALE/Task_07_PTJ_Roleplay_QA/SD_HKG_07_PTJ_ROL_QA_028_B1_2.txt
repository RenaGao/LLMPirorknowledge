Yes, I have worked part-time, uh, in - previously I worked as a personal tutor in some tutorial schools but I only work for one day, just as I said like 4 or 5 hours per week, yeah.
Uh, now I don't.
Well, my previous job, it's called a personal tutor, but then those kids are really, really young and then I feel like what's they just shouldn't come to tutorial class like primary one students or like kindergarten school students are coming for tutorial classes and then I think, no, this is not appropriate, so I just decided to quit.
Um, I think that private tutor should be better because, well, one-to-one and then whilst you teach that student, no other kids will disturbed you, so it's really better to - for the teacher and also for the student.
Uh, I disagree.  It's - it's good to have a part-time job because as I just said you can gain some work experience and maybe if you want to go on holidays or you have some money to spend, then it's good to have a part-time job, but it's not that important because when you're in college and if you are really, really interested in studying like maybe you want to go further in your studies like get the master degree, Ph.D. then maybe you should focus more on your study and not to work.
