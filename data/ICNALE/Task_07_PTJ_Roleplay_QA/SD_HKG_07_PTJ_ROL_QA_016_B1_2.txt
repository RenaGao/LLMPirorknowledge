Uh, for once or twice but not a very long part-time, not, uh, month continuing job.
No.
The latest part-time job is to work as a sales in selling wine.  And I was very honored to being worked with my friend and to do some reception jobs and to sell wine to the seniors.  And we have learned something more about wine because it's all about, uh, introducing wine to the customers and we can have some wine tasting.  And it's a great fun, actually.
Um, simply because my friend asked me to go to.
So I tried for one.
Yeah.
Uh, yeah.
Um, I will prefer one-to-one teaching.
Um, because it's very hard to manage a group of students, especially they have different thoughts and usually if they stay in groups as - meaning they are staying after school and they are much impatient and they would not really pay attention what - to what you are talking about and really noisy.  And as compared to one child and to face-to-face and your children to him or her and she will probably pay a little more attention to you because you are the only person you are facing - as she is facing, so yeah, one - one will be enough.
Hmm, uh, I am disagreeing this--- 
---because like this role play, I think college students should focus more on studying because this is the final four years, if you are not going to do a master degree or other things or research, uh, it will be the last four years that you can actually go to library and read some papers or very crazy thoughts about, um, linguistics or whatsoever translation and you could know more about something less practical I can - you may say.
And this is the four years that you won't get back and once you go to work and you will never have the chance to learn more about the academic studies and yeah so better not go to part-time and spend your time.
