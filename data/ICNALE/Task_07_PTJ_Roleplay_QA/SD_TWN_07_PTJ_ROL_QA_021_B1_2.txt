Um, not - because I worked part-time at my grandma's shop.  So it's not very typical part-time, yes.
No.
Oh.  My grandma was - had a shop that selling the food.
Um, like noodles or some rice and dumplings.
And so because I was just a junior high school student then.  And so the work I can - I can did   is like washing dishes or clean the table like that.
Um, because, uh, when I was the junior it is not illegal to work part time.  So - so I just can't work at my grandma's shop because yes, nobody will tell - tell other that, "Oh, it's illegal going to work there" and - um, yes, and I think it is, um, it's a win-win way to - for me and my grandma because she can have some - somebody to help her and I can earn some pocket money.
Um.  I - I think I would try the cram school first--- 
Because, uh, the cram school usually will settle a remark or a schedule so I can just follow it but if the tutor and the student will want you to teach - teach him or her yes and it is one - one of - yes, you will usually teach my students once and I think it need more skills and time but I haven't - I haven't - I haven't done this work before, so I think I have to try the easier one.
Agree.
Uh, some students do a part-time job because due to their, um, economic so, uh, but if - um, if the student, uh, parent can - can give - can give them the money they want but - but I think that experience is important too.  So, you still have to work a part-time job and - and to learn some - some communication skills and roles in society and how to and you can adjust - adjust the society more.
