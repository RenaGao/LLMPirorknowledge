Uh, my part-time job is uh ticketing staff in some travel agency.
Uh, it is like doing ticketing orders - orders like or handle the customers who wants to buy ticket airplanes and just like that.

I guess teach in the house is better.
It is like a private area and the student can ask some objects---
---and the teacher can focus to explain to the student.
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
I agree with that statement.
Because uh when you do the part-time job, it is just like you can upgrade your knowledge---
---upgrade your uh practicing the theory that maybe you already accept, already have from the study life.  And when you get the part-time jobs, just like uh you have new place, new area to explore more about yourself.
I don't think so money is one of the reason---
---because I guess the experience is more important for us---
---and then just like when you know something, it is just like new experience and you can do the better person I guess.
Yeah
