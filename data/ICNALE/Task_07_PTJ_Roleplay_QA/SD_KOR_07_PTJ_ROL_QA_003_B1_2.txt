Mm-hmm.
Yes, for sure 
No.
Uh, um, because actually per the - per the hour it pays very well.

That's why I chose the job.
Mm-hmm.

Mmm, because I really want to work in a public school.
And, uh, I want to be a homeroom teacher---
---and to handle my students---
---and to get to know them and to help them.  That's just one of my dreams.
I really agree with them.
Yeah.
Um, because in the college studying is not all that the students have to do in the future.  After graduating college most of the students maybe have a job, have a work.  So, I think experience as something like part-time job or any jobs it's really important for their future life.
