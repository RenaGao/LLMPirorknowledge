Yes.
Uh, Okay.  Uh, actually, I have started my part-time job since I came to Japan last year, because in China, we as a college student, we don't have much opportunities to get the part-time jobs or something because everything is for the regular jobs and we don't have the chance.  Uh, so after I came to Japan, at first, I - I started working in the company as a staff, and then I - I just - uh, I changed the job to - to - to become the, uh - the - also doing on the register for the supermarket because it paid me well.  And then I moved to Kobe.  Now I am a shop assistant in Uniqlo.
Okay, because I really wanted to improve my Japanese skills and - because, uh, before - before I came to Kobe, enter the university, and I - I have studied in - I have studied in the language school, but my classmates are all Chinese people, so we just speaking Chinese.  So that I couldn't have the chance to improve my Japanese skills.  So, this is the only chance I can communicate with Japanese people.
Maybe I will try to become the home teacher.
Yes, because like - like I said before, I like this kind of one to one conversation.  I feel more secure and I can talk much more than what I wanted.
I think I agree with this - this statement because I think it's - it's really important for a person to become independent, especially economically independent.  And because this is the only way you can - um, you can buy your stuff or you can - you can - you can state your opinion in a very tough way.  And I think it's - it's really - it's the first step of being a grownup.
