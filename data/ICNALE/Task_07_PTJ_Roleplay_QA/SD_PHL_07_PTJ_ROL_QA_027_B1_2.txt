No, sir.
I guess, I am more into studying right now and I want to focus with my studies.
I want to try home-tutor because I think that it is really close to my profession, which is I'm taking now, an iB   English and I think it is more - it is close to my profession.  That's umm, I think I can umm, improve my skills in terms of being an English major and also for being a home-tutor.
It depends on the situation because I think though - to those students who are financially lacked they have really - they really have to work to support their studies.  But for those students who has - who has parents that has the ability to support them.  So I think there is no reason for them to work or to have a part-time job.
