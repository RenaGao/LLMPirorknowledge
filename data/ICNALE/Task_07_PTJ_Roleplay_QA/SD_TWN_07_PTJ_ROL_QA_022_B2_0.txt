Yes,
Yes.
I am a math teacher at the, uh, uh---  
Cram school and student house both.
Uh, I choose to be a home teacher because it is - it is high paid and it is uh, uh, XXX  
Uh, flexible.  It's flexible.
Being a math teacher in cram school is stable.
And well, it will not be like fired after the student graduate.
Just help the student solve Math problems after class.
Uh, um, I first met this job when I was - I was graduated.  I just graduated from my high school and at that time I don't have any job but I really need some money to, uh, activate my summer vacation plan.
And I think when - at that time I think when I was - when I am in college I have to have some money to go out with friends and joining a club.
Try?
I think home teacher.
Uh, the working - working hours is short and high - high paid.
And it's more flexible than cram school assistant.
I agree because, uh, when you're - when you're in college and you will have to work in several years later, so you have to make yourself experienced.  So, you can start to work for to - to be ready.
