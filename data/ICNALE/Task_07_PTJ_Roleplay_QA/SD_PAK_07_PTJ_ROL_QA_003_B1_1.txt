Hmm, no.
Because at that time I was too much busy in my studies and my family also didn't allow to, uh, try or do - to try - carry the, uh, job etcetera because I had - I didn't have the maturity like now I have and I am - I am sure I have the ability to continue my studies with my job.
Uh, teaching is impossible because at this time I have to study the - at that time I am in the university, so I can't pay attention but I want to join any, uh, computer, uh, company or any, uh, documentary company in which I can work, uh, in - after the university time.
Uh---
I pay attention in the home tuitions.
Because, uh, it didn't take my - the university time and I will manage my studies also.  So, mm, with the passage of time I try to increase the tuitions day by day and my thesis, uh, should also be completed.
Yeah, I agree.
Because the persons, uh, who, uh, give the home tuitions in the university time, they also have learned many things that they didn't in the school or college time.  It will increase the knowledge of the student and, uh, uh, with - I have many experience how to handle the things and how to face the - in the future.
