Not long, only one day.
I - I had a part-time job, uh, five times.
Hmm, wash dishes.
Hmm, I think that is all.
Because, uh, that's - this is not my choose, but my friend's choose.
Yeah.
But he likes me.  Just he said, just writing something, but when I followed him, I became wash dishes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hmm, I like - so, I teach in school.
Yeah.
Uh, I can meet many of the students---
---and many of the students' hobby and like something.
So, I want to like many of them.
Yeah.
I want - excuse me, one more.
Hmm.
I agree.
Because when - uh, not many people like me.
I is actually, uh, getting a job.
I am not - I'm - now, I am not a teacher, but teacher - I think teacher and I didn't - uh, maybe I have no experience another jobs.
I think we have a part-time job is very good, because we have no experience and we can say good job because we have - when we know we - we have no experience in the job, we can't have conversation with them.
