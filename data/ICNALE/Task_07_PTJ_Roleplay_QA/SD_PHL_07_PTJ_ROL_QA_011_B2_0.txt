Ah, no.
It's because of my, it's because I lacked the time, especially going here, it's already, already 3 hours and going back home, 3 hours again, so 6 hours, that would be.  I don't have the time for, to have a free part-time job.
Umm, I think I would like to try teaching on senior high school going to college, because I think, because for me I, I am a bit jealous on senior high school, because they can try to improve themselves before, improve themselves more before going to college, having a specialization.  I think that is one of the critical times that we can teach the students to be more specialized on something.
I disagree because having, I don't think that having a part-time job always, always has its, it doesn't all, always have some disadvantages.  It has some disadvantages, but, and also advantages.  But those advantages doesn't   always overpower those disadvantages.  And I think the, the part-time job doesn't really help that much in the current studies of the college student.
