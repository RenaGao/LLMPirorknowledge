Never.
Actually, I would like to but I don't have such time in the past.  And for this semester I actually have such time but I don't want - I don't put myself to take that.

By having part-time job, we could be able to learn more in the real case situation.
Because sometimes when we studied by the books, it's actually telling about the basic only.  But in the real situation we will find something new or something - something mysterious sometimes.

Maybe the - one of the most negative impacts by having part-time job is they couldn't be able to manage their time well.
