Yes.
No, I don't have now.
Yes.  When I was in Rawalpindi, I was doing a part-time job - a business of freezing, you know, some snacks or some sort of, so I was doing it at evening, but um, uh, as your concern, um, it is quite difficult to manage both things on day time, yes, studies and - at evening.
So, I choose, uh, because, um, that was at in evenings, uh, so the - my work, uh, I give money to some labor person who made things for me and my work only was to deliver those product into super stores.
I would love to teach at school, not at home.
Because I think, um, in school, there is a different scenario.  At - at home of student's home, so there is a different scenario, you have to, uh, bear a lot of things because you're sitting in your student's home, um, sometimes he did something wrong, but you have to bear all - all those things.
Yes, uh, in - in this case, those students who want a part-time job, government should have to help them, otherwise my personal opinion, there is no part-time job.  Student should have to concentrate on his studies.
This part-time job is - is a good one, but, uh, it is difficult to concentrate.  In student's life, student's concentration only on their studies.  So, if they convert their mind into two things, if you enter into two boats, so it is difficult to continue with both things.
