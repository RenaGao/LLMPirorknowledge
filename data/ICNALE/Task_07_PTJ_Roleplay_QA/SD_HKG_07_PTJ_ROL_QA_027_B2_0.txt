Yes.
Yes.
Um, I - I work in a learning center like three, uh - two days a week, and I also have like personal tutoring for some - um, secondary school students.
Um, the first reason would be, um, I - I can like feel, um, successful when - when I can like improve, uh, the student's English, especially when, uh - if they have a non - have a bad foundation, if - if I can see improvements I - I will feel happy about that.
Hmm.
Um, I will prefer, uh, teaching a group of students rather than like just one-on-one.
Because I think sometimes you will feel sleepy when - when you are just teaching one student because there isn't and like, um, very much interaction between the two people, and then sometimes you - when you have to teach something like very - that is very dull, like some grammar items and they just have to understand and then do the, um, exercise and you will feel so bored waiting for them to answer all those questions, and then you just sit there.  But, if you teach a group of students, you can actually interact with them, like asking more questions and sometimes you can tell jokes to make the atmosphere, like more funnier and more interesting.  So, I will prefer like group teaching.
Yes.  Um, I think that like although we can learn a lot of things in school but sometimes we don't know how to apply them in - in real practice, so actually, uh, part-time jobs is something like, uh, a method for us to - to apply the things we learn.  For example, as - as for me I can, um, apply like the - the English I - I've learned and to teach - and teach students.  And sometimes, um, you also have to learn how to communicate with different kinds of people, um, at work because you will face, um, many people in the - in the future and communication is important.  And it some - sometimes people may just ignore this because they - they think that if they get a good grade from - from examination, and - and they can get a good job.  So they - sometimes they may neglect this point.
