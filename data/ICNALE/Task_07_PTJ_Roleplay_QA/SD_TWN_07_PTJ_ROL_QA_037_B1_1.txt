Yeah, I'm doing it now.
Okay.  I am working at Starbucks.  Uh, this is really a - a hard work because, uh, I need to spend 80 hours - 80 hours a week.
Yeah, yeah.
A month.  I'm sorry. 
Yeah, yeah, 80 hours a month.
Yeah.
So, for me as a student, right, it's really hard to balance my work and my job - uh, my job and my - my assignment.
Yeah.
Because I like social life XXX , yeah.
And it's really good to, uh, fast to people - various of people.  And, uh, you will meet many people that you haven't met before and of course you servi - you service for them and your smile and your service - service and their, um, interaction with - with them it's - I'd like to do that.
Yeah.
I like.
Yeah, because sometimes people amuse me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You mean which grades or---?  I mean a home tutor and a cram school teacher.  Uh, I would like to choose a cram school teacher.
Because, um, because cram - cram stu - cram school students would not be just one or two.  There are many, maybe more than 10 and I can't - um, because you are a teacher, you stand on a stage then you can see whole - whole classmate - uh, whole classroom and see every student's actions.  I like to, um, how to say - I like to see what their action and they want to attack you or they need your help, you can - you can tell.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I like to watch many people, many students, many little-little children to, you know, watch their eyes to know what they need.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I agree.
Because I think nowaday , of course, next generation, um, too many people lack of - lack of having experience on in - interacting with people around you.  And because your parents protect you so much then you don't have any - um, you don't have any problem or any obstacle to, you know, to interact with people and to having - to have experience on, how to say, to - uh, to deal with your boss, yes, and face the true world.  You - you don't have that kind of experience.  So, how - how do you - how can you, uh, go on stage of the world.  Yeah.  So, I think it's very important to have a part-time job even just a tutor or just a, you know, small.
Yeah, prepare themselves.
Yeah.
