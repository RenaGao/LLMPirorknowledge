Worked part-time, uh  
No because before this uh I worked with my mom.  My mom is baby-sitter, so I play with the baby and I used to love baby and it's, it's great time because, uh, I learned something from my mom, and the baby is nice.
No.
Uh, recently no, because, uh, I am freshman so I need to more focus on my study first.
Because, uh, because, uh, now this, uh, babysitter is not - babysitter is more easier than you work with someone like in, in a restaurant you work with, uh, the manager.  So for babysitter, uh, is I take care of something.  So it need more need need to do.  So when you, uh, bath the baby, you need to be careful.  When you take care, the baby want to sleep definitely so you need to take care of the baby.  So it's difficult but it give you an experiences.
Uh basically, I, I am happy with teaching.  I love to teach so in my class, uh, I love to teach math and chemistry so I love  
So I, I love to teach in school.
Because when you teach in home tutor, uh, it will saw - yes, if you saw no space for - so you need a space and a good surrounding to teach.  So basically, when you - in school you have surrounding, the environment, field.  So, uh, teaching someone make you good.
For me, uh, I agree because, nowadays, people take PTPTN and also so uh some some, some students now take PTPTN so they, uh, need to, uh take the part-time job because now - nowadays, uh, we need money to buy something.  Without money, you can't buy something.  So you need money to do the life all thing.
