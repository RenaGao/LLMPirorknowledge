Uh, not yet.
But actually, today's job is kind of---.
I guess in China like student, they can still, I could - it's - uh, they can still get money from their parents.  That is normal.  They will not be shame of that.  And actually the part time job, the - the money they can earn from part time job, it's very low.  So, I think they wouldn't want to do that.
Uh, I think I will be the tutor to the student's home.
I think it's more efficient, it's more efficient.
Since you go to the student's home and, uh, can have a chance to know how the student you're teaching and make him to be better, well, they will perform better in the - in the academic thing.  So, I think, uh, I did good - and I will think I did good in my job.  So, it's more can be proud of myself.
Yeah, I think, uh, it's - it's just to decide, it depend on what you want.  If you really like me, that really need a part time job to do, I think it's a good idea.  But if you - you want to - want to be a researcher, I think you better in the lab and do some research, it's better.
