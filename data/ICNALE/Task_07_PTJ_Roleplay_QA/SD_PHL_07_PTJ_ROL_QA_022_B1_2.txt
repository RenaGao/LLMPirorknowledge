Yes.
I don't but I worked before.
I had two part-time jobs.  One was being a call-center agent and the other one was being a service crew in a McDonald.
First because - the first one because it a - it has a big salary that can help me and then the other one because it was near my house.
I would like to try home-tutor because I think I can better help understand my students if I can see then face-to-face.
I don't think it's really important.  If you don't need the job then you can decide to not take any.
