Yes.
Yes.
Uh, I was in the, um, afterschool class.
Physical, uh, it's
Yeah.
The, the, the, the - well, it's, uh, uh, I help the parents know what their children in the class, what class they will tend to.
Cram school.
Uh, high school.
Senior high.  Yeah.
Because I used to, uh, be in that cram school and I like the teacher and - and the teacher, uh, well, it's summer vacation.  And he need somebody to work for him.  He chose me and he gave me iPhone for the, uh - for the, uh, gift.
Yeah.
Because I - I - I - I helped him in the summer vacation.  Uh, like, every day 8 hours every day.
Yeah.  Yeah.
That summer vacation I earned many money.
Yes.  I also have teach a student, uh, in senior high maths.
As a home tutor.
Because one by one I can know the student's situation and I can change the plan further.  Maybe, you can more, uh, rise his or her grade.
Disagree.
Um, I have part-time job.  And I think, uh, if you want to have a part-time job, you can just, uh, search for that, and um, many, many, many, many job you can do.  And - and I think college student have many time, uh, in study or something.  Uh, I have many free time when I'm in college, uh, more and more than when I - I am in senior high.  So, I don't think that study will be a problem to me.
As they want, uh, I think it is not - I think, uh, every people has their choice.  It's not should - what you do.
