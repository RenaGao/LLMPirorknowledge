 Yes.
 Uh, I worked --- I'm uh work part-time job as a cram school teacher.
 And I also have a work --- part-time job at the Miko --- Miko Shrine --- Shrine --- Shrine --- so I cannot --- I don't know Jap uh in English, but the Japanese say MIKO  .
 Umm, the shrine's job is uh were recommendation from my high school teacher.
 Every year my high school umm introduced some students to work at one specific uh one shrine near my high school.
 And the cram school teacher was my umm was --- I want to --- I want to work with.
 The uh you mean that the cram school teacher is teaching uh many students one time or---  
 Uh, yes.
 Uh, I --- I want to work at the cram school.  
 Because at home --- home tutor is, there is no pers --- no --- no people who give me advice but at cram school there are professional teacher, so I can't uh I can ask some question   to --- question about teaching.
 And I can get some information to develop student's skill.
 Uh, I umm I agree with that opinion.  
 Umm, if uh if the students have umm want to have part-time job it is okay to have --- have a part-time job because in --- to decide the job in the job uh to decide a job at job interview or as a job hunting umm the experiences of part-time job will be useful for their decision.
 So, I --- I agree that university students do part-time job.
