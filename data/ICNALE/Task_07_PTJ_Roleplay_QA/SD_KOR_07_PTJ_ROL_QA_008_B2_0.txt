Yes.
Uh, recently I worked at a cafe.
And I also worked as a private tutor for three 3 hours - 3 years.
And I also worked at a Korean BBQ restaurant.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh, particularly private tutor job, I was raised in a very small city.
So, there are a lot of students still need private tutor.
But there - there isn't any private tutor in my village.
So they wanted me to be private tutor for them.
Yes.
Mm-hmm?
Try?
Uh, I wanted to try private tutor again.
Because there are a lot of advantages to be a private tutor, because I wanted to teach one or two students that I find.
So, I can understand what they are struggling - struggling.
I can handle the problem what they have.
I totally agree with that.
Because, uh, part-time job gave a lot of opportunities to meet a lot of people who are different from them.
And also they can make money for their treat.
