No.
Not at all.
Not even once.
Uhm, well, uh okay my - my college schedule is very, very tight like I really got no chance to  
---for myself, yes, I was busy.
Oh yeah.
Well, I think both of them have like the plus and minus.  
For me, well I prefer at school because it will give benefits to like lot of students not just one I think.
Okay.  Okay if - if - if - if I was a home tutor I would just probably teach one student only.  But at school, well that could be a class right, that it would be like 20 or 30 people and uh the important - what I think is most important is like I - I give my knowledge to like uh a lot - a lot of students so not just one.
Sorry, can you repeat it?
Important, okay.   
Okay.  Oh well, I think I disagree.  I think that.  
Uh, it cannot be applied to all of college students.  I mean it - it depends on what kind of situation are you in.  I mean uh if - if you're not doing part-time jobs, I think that's okay.  I mean I think that it's not really that important.
Okay.
