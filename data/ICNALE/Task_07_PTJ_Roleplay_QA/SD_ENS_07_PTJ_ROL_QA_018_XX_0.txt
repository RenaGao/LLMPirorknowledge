Yes.
No.  Umm.  Okay, I came to Japan as a student.
I was a - through a scholarship grant.  It was kind of like an exchange program.
I came here as a student nurse, so while I was working at - it's - it's an old people's home, I was going through to language school.
So I do four hours of language school, and then in the afternoon, I would go work at the hospital.
Yes.
Umm, yes, I basically did what the rest of the staff do on a regular basis, like change diapers, give bath to the elderly, feed - feed them, give medications, just talk to them and, you know---
I chose it because in the Philippines, it's very difficult to find a - a job that pays well, and I really wanted to just leave the Philippines because I see that there is no future there for me.  And then my mom saw an ad for that and then she gave it to me.  She said why not try it.  And then I did and then I - I went through six months' language training in the Philippines and then they sent me here.  So it's - yeah, out of necessity.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hmm.  Just based on my experience, I would like to teach a group.
One-on-one might be difficult because I don't have any experience with one-on-one teaching.  I think I am more comfortable with, like a classroom setting, you are working on the activities for them to, you know - just - just lot more opportunities for me to have the students interact with each other.
Hmm.  Having a part-time job is very  .
Very important.
Kind of have to disagree, well to - to a certain degree because if - if you are in Japan, like for me I came here, I needed that part-time job, so I think it is very important.  But if you live with your parents and then they support your school - schooling, you know, I don't think it would be very, very important.  I think just focus on your studies and, you know, do well, get good grades and then - then you can focus on getting a good job.
