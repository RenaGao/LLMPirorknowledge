No.
Not at all.
Uhm, first, the first reason one is my father dis - dis - disagree if I have a part-time job.
And also I got my scholarship.  And the - the rule of my scholarship is like 100 study, no part-time jobs.
Completely to the study.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Hmm.
Yeah uh, in this country - in my city - in this city yeah, doing like a part-time job as a lecturer, teacher to the elementary school students.
Uhm, yeah, I have.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
But it's just like 1 month.
Actually I cannot say that it's a part-time job uh is because I am living in the one - a rent house.  And my host, my host in my home have children.  So he - she asked me to teaching uh, her son and give me some, you know, a little bit of money after that  
So, we try like a month but after that I am really busy with my campus life.  So, yeah, just stop it in the middle.
A part-time job?
Uhm, yeah.
Uh-huh.
Oh, if I choose today, I will choose the home teacher.
Because the time is more flexible, so I can adjust the time uh, the teaching time with my student.  As long as I have a - I have time, so I can teach him or her.
I thought it's okay, yeah.  I thought the experience is more important rather than the salary.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Sure.
