Yes sir.
One of my jobs was a - a baker.  I was working in a bakery where make breads and cake, stuff like that.
I didn't choose the job, the job choosed   me because there was no other choice and I have no option not to do that job, not because I like it.
Yes sir.
I would like to try a school teaching.
Yes sir.
Because I am a student and I need more experience about other students.
I agree sir.
Yeah, because it - it helps the students to prepare for a better future and to make them become stronger when they are really into working fields after the university.
