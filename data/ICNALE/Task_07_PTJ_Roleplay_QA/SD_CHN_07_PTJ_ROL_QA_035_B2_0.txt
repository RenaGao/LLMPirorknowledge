Okay.
Yes, of course.
Uh, part-time job, I do - I - I think, uh, it's like teaching younger students to learn math or learn English, uh, and, uh---
Yeah, like home tutor, or I try to do a inter-job.  I - I - I don't think there is a lot of difference between inter or part-time job.  Uh, I done inter-job in a - uh, in a Chinese traditional, um, how to say, organization.  Uh, it's actually working for a lot of, uh, visitors, uh, to learn something, uh, as, uh, my home town is in North Shaanxi, the city named Yan'an and, uh, it's actually a city really famous in China and lot of visitors - uh, I mean, not travelers but visitors try to come to this city and to XXX   of our, uh, you know, our - our, how to say, the - the - the - the, uh, community.  Okay, uh, so, mm, I - I have - the - the inter-job is basically about, uh, try to help those visitors learning or, uh, do travel some spot in Yan'an, try to learn some, you know, sprint  of the community.
No.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, I - I - I have never - I have never teached   at school, but I think I will like to choose to teach at home because, um, for me, I am a little bit shy in front of - speaking in front of lot of people.  So, uh, I will like few - uh, I think, uh, I am more comfortable, mm, to speak one to one person.
Uh, as I just said, I do think part-time job - if - if you choose the right part-time job and you have, uh, very good, uh, reason to argument as you just said, to support and to - to - to learn something for you, I do think part-time job is okay for me.
Mmm, that's basically based on their requirement like if they want to earn some money, uh, and they have lots of time, and I would try to give some help or some information about part-time job, but I - I am not say - like encourage them.
Yeah, yeah.
