Not actually.
No.
Well, I didn't think about it in the before - in - in my - before and - and I - I - I didn't find a chance to doing   part-time.
Yes.
Well, if I teach, I - I may want to try teaching at home because if you compare with teaching - teaching at cram school, you have to - you only have to wait - you have to - the students you have to face is - is smaller and you don't have to - you can find out their problem very, very exactly.  And if you do, um - if you work on cram school and you just - you just keep - keep, uh - you just keep doing it - doing and it's not - you can - you can - you - you cannot follow - you have to - you have to follow your schedule and you cannot - it's - it's harder for you to stop--- 
---when you found out - found out that some student has problems.
Because the schedule is - you have to stick to it - stick to a schedule.
Well, mostly I agree with that because college - in - in the - in this market - in the market - in the market the - the employee want to - the employer wants to - wants to - to have some - maybe - maybe your - they tend to believe the college student rather than students from high school or others.  So, I think it's - it's, uh - it's an advantage.
