No, I haven't.
Uh, because I think that is going to give an effect on my studying.
Yes.
Um-hmm.
Teaching at school.
Uh, I think it's about the atmosphere.  Like, if you are at school, the atmosphere is - you are being in school, right?  The - you will be surrounding by the - the school environment, the student, the teacher, there will be the - the face provides you the - the staff or teaching more than at - at the student's home.
Disagree.
Uh, because I think university student life - university - the university students have to study hard - harder than the secondary students.  So, I think we have to be more focused on our - our - our studying more than working part-time job.  And as - there is a lot of my friend working part-time job in a class, I mean the classmate, and they often at - they often be absent and when working in group, they always come late or doesn't come, and when I ask - ask her or him about the - the reason, he said that last night, he worked until late and she cannot wake up in the morning, so that's why - that's why she cannot come to help me with - with our work.  And after that I never group with her again.
So, I think you have to be more focused.  As you are a student, you have to focus more on studying, not the work.
