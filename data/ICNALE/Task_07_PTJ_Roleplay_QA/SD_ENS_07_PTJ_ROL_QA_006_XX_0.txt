Alright.
Yes I have.
Yes, I did.
Uhm, I worked actually for the university itself.  I worked as a food service employee.  So that basically entailed working in the cafeteria area of the university at the dormitories and prepare - well, not preparing but serving hot foods, or also just other foods like desserts and snacks.
Uhm, I like the idea of at least working for the university because it was the university itself that I would be employed with and well also my roommate at the time, he also had a job there and he had recommended it to me.  And I did want to save money at that point in time.
Hmm, personally I would prefer the school setting.
Uhm, it's where I have the most experience with, uhm, so I am more comfortable I feel with that sort of school setting.  And it also maximizes the number of students that I can assist.  It feels - of course it's good to help students even if it's one-to-one, but I feel like maximizing the number of students I can assist is better.
I do agree that it's - it's important.
Uhm, as I sort of tried to express in the role-play that there is a lot of experience that a student can gain from just the work environment because uh, at least to my understanding most Japanese young people, their - their first job is directly after university, like and there's a lot of like life skills they can gain from a part-time job.
