No.
No.
Not at all.
Because I think that if the job I am doing can let me learn something such as some skills or something necessary for me to, in the future, I would like to do it, but - but I think that I can found some probably part-time job that is very useful for me.  So, I didn't try to do a part-time job while learning at school.
Uh, I will like to try to be a home tutor---  
Because usually a - being a teacher in a cram school is very, very busy and not - can't get paid so much.  But if I want - if I should, if I want to do the part-time job, that means that I need money, but in the same situation, when I am wasting time, because I can't learn anything what I'm telling.  I can learn many things when I'm telling them, telling the students, teaching students, but at the same situation, when I am wasting the same time, I would like to get paid more money.
I think it depends on what kinds of your background is.  If your background it can support you to study in college without some financial problems, then you don't need to do the part-time job except that it can help you for your future.  But if you can't afford your college, then I think it is not a bad choice to have a part-time job.
