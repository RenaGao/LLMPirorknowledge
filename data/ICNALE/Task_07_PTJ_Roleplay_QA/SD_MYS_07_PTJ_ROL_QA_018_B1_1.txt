Yes.
Now, not yet, but I will seek for part-time job.
Yeah.
Right now?
Because now I am busy with final year project, so actually right now I am not planning for any part-time.
Umm - I like to teach - umm - primary school or kindergarten because my previous part-time job as a kindergarten teacher which I teach 4 years old.  I think teaching the kids is - umm - very good because I can see how they develop and it can give me a great feeling that I never felt before.
Umm - by teaching the primary, I also can develop my pa - patient because they are different with the - older people.  They - they are pure and we need to do very good to make them good. I think that's my reason.
Umm - yes, I agree, but sometimes I am not agree.  It is not too important, but if the - that college student need to do part-time job, then go for it, but never - ah - always manage the time between the study and the job.
In the middle.
I agree because it give benefits, it give money, and it teach us to manage the time, but I disagree if the student cannot manage the time and make - make the reason by doing part-time job and cannot do - cannot study very well.  It is actually depends to the student.
Depends to the student to - if they think they can, so they can do it.  If they cannot, so better not to do part-time job and just study.
