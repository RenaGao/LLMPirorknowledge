Maybe in the house is better because---
Because in the house I think we will only have to teach one student.  So it will be easier to teach them rather than in the school which is we have to teach more than one student.
But I think it depend on your major.  If your major is for the teaching, you I think it's better to - to teach in the school rather than in the home.  But if your major is not teaching, I think it's better in teaching in the home.
Yes, I think.
Yes.
Actually, I am agree.
Because after you graduate you have to work and if you can gain the experience before you graduate, I think it's better because the employer will choose the one who have the experience rather than the one who have not the experience.
If that happen, I think it's better to focus in the study rather than have to do a part-time job.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
