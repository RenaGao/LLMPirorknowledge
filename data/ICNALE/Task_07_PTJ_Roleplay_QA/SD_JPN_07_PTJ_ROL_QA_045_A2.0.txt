 Thank you.
 I have worked once in last Saturday.
 It is a job --- a job in Kobe University.
 Eh. I worked as a PC staff member.
 We prepare the class that is needed for the new student who can't use computer very well in April, so we prepare the presentation and presentation for the class in --- in this summer.
 I choose --- I chose it because I want to use computer very well by ARUBAITING     in Kobe University PC staff members.
 I --- I want to work in cram school.
 Eh. I --- I have no experience in teaching, so home tutor is very responsible for me and I first I learn to work in cram teacher. If I work, the --- the other teachers may support uh support me.
 I agree with it uh because uh we'll --- we will work in society after graduating college, so if we don't experience part-time job, we can't understand the --- the society and the --- the manner as a shop member very well.
