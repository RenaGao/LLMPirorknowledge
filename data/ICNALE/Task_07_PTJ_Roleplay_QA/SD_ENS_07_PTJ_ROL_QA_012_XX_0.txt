Yes.
Yes.
Okay, so I was working part time as a - I was working part time at retail.  I was working at Abercrombie & Fitch for 2-1/2 years.
Okay, so uh, I worked in Impact so I was working in a stock room and I was organizing clothes for the front.
One more time?
I prefer the school with a group of kids.
Because my teaching style is more fit towards a large crowd or groups.  Ah, teaching one-on-one means ah, however you do on your performance is going to be based what the one child thinks of you.  And sometimes you have to change yourself for that one student now you are - that you are teaching which if you are teaching several students one-on-one, it can be exhausting.  Not only that, but you have to continually change your lessons depending on the students that you teach.  But if you are working a group, with a set age group, like oftentimes you can check with the teacher based on the lesson plans that you make before you go out and teach it.  And since you will be teaching a group, everybody is basically learning the same thing so you don't have to worry as much.  And since they will be working into groups, I believe you can give them more opportunity to practice the target language working as a group by themselves.
It depends on your circumstances.  So I am not really sure if I can really agree or disagree but the fact is well when I was - at least when I was a part time - when I - when I was working as a college student, I really didn't have that much money and I needed to make enough money to survive.  Of course if you have a scholarship then you probably don't really need a part-time job like our discussion was earlier.  But the - the thing is probably at least if you are looking in Japan, there is not really that many scholarships programs.
Go ahead.
Because I had a connection with a friend.  So he went over and talked to the manager and got me that job.
