Um, yes, as a tutor, but, uh, two years ago, but not doing anymore.
Uh, it's not quite a part-time job, but I help, uh, other students from other department or faculties with their English composition.
Yes, but not much because I want to help them.
Uh, well, sometimes I am lazy to study on my own, but by doing this, I help other people, also I help myself to review the study, just basic grammar.
Yes.
Yes.
Um, I prefer studying at home.
Yeah, teaching at home.
Well, because the surrounding, the feeling is that you - at home, you will be more comfortable in studying, I guess, because I did that too when I was in high school.
No I didn't - I strongly disagree because yeah, as you said, it could distract the student from their study and, uh, sometimes the student might think that oh, I can do my job, I don't have to study anymore, which I don't know is a good idea if they leave their study to work, because it's not, uh, a secure job I guess.
Yes.
