Um, yes.
In summer vacation but not as when I am studying and work part-time.
Um, I - um, I work in - in dumpling restaurant and - and in - in restaurant I do everything like, um - like take order or clean table or wash - wash - wash plates or, um - or - or cooking and - and also I - I made dumpling by myself.
Because the restaurant, um, offered me, uh, scholarship.
Um, since we - since I start in senior high school.
So, uh, in exchange I need to go part-time job.
In summer vacation.
Uh, I - I had a home tutor and - but I never came to cram school.  And I think home tutor is, uh, very unique - unique job for me because in - um, when I teach the student, um, I know that I have many, uh, efficient in - in senior high school and - and, uh, because I never came to cram school I think maybe next semester I can find the cram school - uh, cram school job.
Um, I think college student have - sorry, can you repeat the question.
 .  Um,   I think I agree with this, um, because college student have more free time and it is good to - to find a job where you can earn some money for your - your - your living, and you can also have some job experience.  Um, but if the - the part-time job is too heavy like it - like it can be, um, have bad influence with your - your study and that I think part-time job is not - is - is not good.
