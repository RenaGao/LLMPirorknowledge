Yeah, yeah.
In Japan.
Umm, I - I served customers in a restaurant.
Yeah.
Um, firstly because, um, I do part-time job not - not totally because of money.  Also, I want a chance to talk to Japanese.  I want a chance to listen to more things, um, about Japan, so I want to do serving.  - I - I want to serve customers instead of washing things.
Yeah.  Secondly, um, that restaurant is quite - people there are very friendly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I - I - I like that atmosphere.
Yeah.

Umm, I guess I want to try teaching at home.
Umm, teaching in a school, you cannot really pay attention to oer students.
Yeah, but, uh, face-to-face, you can know, oh, today he or she made a improvement, and how can I make some plans to make him or her to grow more quickly.  Yeah.
I guess maybe - maybe that student just don't like the way how you teach him.  Maybe - maybe he's that kind of person.  He wants to - um, to study himself and just when he has something that he doesn't understand, he ask you.  Yeah, he's not, umm, maybe - maybe I should change the way how to teach him.  Yeah.  I think it's very important to make him in - make - to make him be interested in studying, yeah.
Um, I guess, it is important because students is basically all the friends are students or teachers, um, and you will find a job in society one day.  You really need to know more about the society and also like if you have part-time job, maybe in that place, they would teach you some business manners.  Yeah, I feel that's quite important if you want to find new job.
