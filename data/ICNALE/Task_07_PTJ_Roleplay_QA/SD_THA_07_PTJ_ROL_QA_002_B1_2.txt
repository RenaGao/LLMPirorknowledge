Yes, I did.
I just checking and answer but it's not a teacher so it's like the mathematic class and it's teaching the student at age about, uh, maybe 6 to 12 years old.  So, the only - the only duty that I can do is just checking the answer.
Marking, yeah.
Hmm, because I can choose the time when I am working - when I need to work that job and so I just, uh - just XXX   and it gave me a lot of chance to choose the time and when I have some kind of emergency situation like the exam - examination--- 
---they allow me to stop working, yeah.
Yes.
Right.
Um, I don't want to try teaching because I am the - for me I - at this time I don't have that in my - that much time to prepare my document to prepare all the study material so I think I cannot do it well.
Between---
Teaching or?
Maybe teaching at home, yeah.
Yes.
I think it's personal opinion for me, somebody, they - maybe they can feel like they don't need to doing part-time job because they just need to focus on their study---
So - so maybe some - for me I just need to learn more - I just need to earn more experiences to - in working in the real situation, just need to know that how they are working in the real life and then can get a little money.
Yes.
