Yeah.  
Uh, yeah.  Yeah, I have.  
Um, I usually do the tutoring - tutoring for---
---in semesters and in summer I work outside like other jobs.
Offices and libraries and I work in like restaurants.  
Yes.  
Yeah.  
Well - well, it's like tutoring you earn more money than other.  
I work for like 6 hours or 4 hours a week and earn lots money for that.  
Yes.  
Uh, yes.  
Right.
I - um, I usually choose to do the like home tutoring just so I can so I can take care of one student.  
And I think I prefer that more.
Yeah.
Well, I think it's good for students to have part-time jobs that they can like, you know, earn money more and but it's - it's not necessary if like their family, their parents are supporting them for live and they don't really find any reason for it.  
I think it's fine XXX  because not work a part-time job like they're going to work for like the case after graduating.
