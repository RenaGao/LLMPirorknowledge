Um, yes, maybe this is a part-time.
Yes.
Um, I have a part-time job on our campus, yes.
And, that is, uh, the title is, uh, student service assistant and I try to answer the students and queries about, uh, the - sometimes maybe some activities or some, uh, different - uh, different kinds of problem maybe face when they ask me by, uh, phone call or walk into the office.
Um, yes, I, uh - first is my friend ask me to do that job and together with her and - and when I look at the job portal I see, uh, the job is quite interesting because, um, I did not have that experience before and, uh, so I think it's a new kinds of experience that can let me learn more.
Um, could you say it again?
I - can I say I have try one time or two times before?
Yes.
Uh, it is like a, uh, to guide the students homeword   and in a group, just, uh, in the - in the, uh - it's in a - it's in a primary school and, uh, I try to monitor the class to, uh - to guide them to do their homewors  .
Uh, actually---
---I prefer private, yeah, the - the private ones because, um, it is, uh, easily - ease - easier than a group to monitor that kind of student because, uh, when I, uh guiding some of them are quite naughty and just walk around in the class and - and some of them even to copy the other's work.  So, I think - I think, uh, that's not good for me to monitor quite a lot of people.
Um, I agree with, uh, the student should have a part-time job because, uh, when you, uh - university student you can have a lot - lot of time and if you don't want to waste that time, you can do a part-time job and when   um, you can have the experience that, uh, uh, working outside and because some of the part-time job may related to their - to their, uh, faculties like, uh, the business faculties, um, they can, uh - they can - some of, um - our school have some, eh, internship for them to, uh, try to, uh, have the work in the bank, uh, to experience when they were a university student.
Um, yes.
