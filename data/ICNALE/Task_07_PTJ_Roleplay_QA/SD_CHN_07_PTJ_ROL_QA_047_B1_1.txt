I - I like teach in school.
Uh, in - because I think, um, uh, teaching in-house and you just teach to - uh, teach only one student and you learn is very, um, little and teaching cram schools I think is very, very bad side is the, um, cram schools is, uh, they - they just like - they just think the profit is important.

So, we have to attach some society's, um, uh, relationship and experience and - and you should know, uh, what is important in a society but now at the school in - in school just you - you could learn some knowledge but some things, um, you - you just - you only - you only learn from the society, so you should, um, have part-time job to know, uh, what is the society is and - and it's good for you when you, uh, can graduate from college.
