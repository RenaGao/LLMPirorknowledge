Yes.
Uh, the job I'm doing is teach your students.
Yes.
Uh, in fact, it's not my choice, it's, uh, more like someones give me the opportunity and I'm willing to try, so I do this.  It's not I, uh, uh, de - deliberately to do to find this job.
Yes.
Um.
In fact, I am doing a cram school teacher, but it's one-on-one, so I feel more like it's about a home taller , so---
Yeah, home tutor.  Yes.
In a group of---
---students, I prefer home tutor.
Because it's, uh, less nervous to me. 
I think if it's part of your plans and I will agree, but if you are not benefit, I don't think you have to, uh, XXX  yourself to the job.  If you think, uh, study is more important, you don't have to force yourself to be taking the part job.
Necessary. 
Right.  I don't think it's necessary.
