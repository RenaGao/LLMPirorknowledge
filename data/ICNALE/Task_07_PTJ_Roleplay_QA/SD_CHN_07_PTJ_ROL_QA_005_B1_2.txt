No.
Uh, I used to, uh, to internship but not a part-time job.
Um, because I majored in accounting so I went to a, um, I went to as a audit - uh, auditors and so but the work - the work of mine is really simple because I have no the - I have no certificate so I just do the, uh, as a - as a assistant to help the, uh, auditor to, uh, help to do the work.
Uh, in China.
Before I went to Japan.
Um, the another one?
No, no, no.
Uh, the ... besides the home tutor?
Cram school?  Uh, yes, uh, the teacher in school because I think - uh, in my opinion, I think once you are at student's house is dangerous because---
But I notify there's some danger, I - so, uh, in school is more, um, safe and convenience for both of us.
Uh, yeah.
Um, although I think now it's above my ability but it's also, uh, I can't take it as a exercise - exercise, correct - exercise to, uh, improve my ability of teaching.
So, that might be good for me although I will not for - I will not feel, uh, very easy, uh, very happy to do this work but, uh, that, um, that might be, uh, useful for me - advantageous to me.
I think every student have their own aim so some people want to, uh, concentrate their energy into the academic study and some people want to, uh, be, uh, taking, uh, more social so - uh, social - uh, social part-time job so they can meet, uh, many people so, uh, it will be a good experience for them.  I think both is okay.
