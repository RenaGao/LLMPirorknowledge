Part-time---  
Uh, no.
I didn't try working part-time because I wanted to become a full-time student.
Uh, I believe the home teacher will be uh, be better for me.
Because uh, the student - the person that I am teaching will be more comfortable because uh, I am inside their house and it will be easier for them to listen.  If I were to be teaching them, I would - I would request them to be in a room where it's very quiet, so it's just me and the student uh, interacting.
Yeah, I - I agree that students need to experience having part-time jobs.  Because um, while first, when you have a part-time job, you are experienced - experiencing the corporate industry or if not, the working industry and you'll have a glimpse of how it's like to be working unlike when you are just a student you are basically doing things as a student unlike if you are a working student, you are multitasking, you are not only working but you are also studying at the same time.
