In Japan, yes.
I am doing the job in - how to say it - drug - medicine shop - medicine shop in---
Yes, in Namba, yes, and I was studying in Osaka so I used to work there.  And I usually, um, um, introduce, uh, hot product that's good for selling, and I will - I - and I find what customer want to find that they use - uh, they usually show me the picture that they want to find, and I will just find for them.
If I have a chance, I will like to teach in school.
Because I think a home teacher is not effective - effectively - because I need to take, uh, uh, public traffic going to that - going that way and just want to - maybe 2 hours, but maybe for - uh, for that, I need to rent, uh, traffic about more than 1 hours and so - and I think, uh, when I meet students about more than five, uh, so more powerful.
Actually, I think maybe we - we don't, uh, do the part-time job is the best.  Um, I didn't, uh, do a part-time job before I came to Japan because my parents will give me, uh, pocket money enough, but, um, even I came to Japan, I also have enough money, but just my friend is, uh, doing part-time job, so if I don't doing that, I feel - I feel that - um, different.  So, they maybe say, you have lot of money so don't - you don't have to do the part-time job.  Yeah, uh, it's made me feel nervous or something like that.  And the part-time job let me feel, uh, more easily to communicate with Japanese and - and the - that's a top - like a topic what - what job I am doing now, what - like that.  And - but actually I think that maybe the - if the Japan - Japanese education want to have a more higher level, that maybe students need to put more emphasize  on their study.  Yes, because they have lot - so - so many job need to do in - and like my friend, um, 4 days a week, yes, going to, um, the part-time job.  I think it's - it's not good.
