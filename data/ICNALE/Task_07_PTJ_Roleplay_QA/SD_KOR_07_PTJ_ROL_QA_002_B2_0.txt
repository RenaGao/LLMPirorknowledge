Yeah.
Yes - yes, I have. 
It wasn't like really work.
Uh, I taught, uh, middle schools students when I was, uh, like - like 7 years ago just one - two middle schools students and I taught them like for an hour.
I taught English or math.
Yes.
I thought that was an easy job and I - I can use my acknowledge of the teaching, but I didn't have really acknowledge about teaching that at that time.  But - but it was fun and like I had a good money right for an hour. 
Yeah.
Oh, I - I like to teach like---
Yeah I like - I like teaching at a public school.
Because the - the teachers of in public school they are treated like very well, I think so.
That's good job.
It - hmm, I agree, I guess.
I guess the students they are still students like you know like from Korea students don't have many experiences outside of school because they have been like studying for what at least 6 years for their university thing.  But - but after getting university they are like mature adult I guess.  So, they can get job or they can experience something, you know, I think they need that just for an adult.
