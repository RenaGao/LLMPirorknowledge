Actually, no.
Never.  I think so - well, actually before I came to Kobe University, I was in Nagoya, and then I helped my supervisor there.
Well, not TA but like preparing for some meeting and do some job at translating.
Like that, for just one - one time.
One time.
Well---
A part-time job.  Umm, well, actually I would like to work in Starbucks.
Yeah.
It's cool and I like coffee.
I like coffee, although I do not know much about coffee, but I think it's a very good chance for me to get some more knowledge about that.
Well, the latter one.
Because, um, I'm not so good at, like, communicate, like--- 
Face-to-face and one-to-one.
Well, actually, that is okay for me.
Well - well, because I've tried.  Tried talking and facing to so many people, like doing presentation.
