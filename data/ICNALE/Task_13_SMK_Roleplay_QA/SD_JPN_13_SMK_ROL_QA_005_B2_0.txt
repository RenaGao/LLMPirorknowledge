 Okay.
 I remember the hotel's restaurant.

 And there were so many foods.
 It's a Viking system and there is roast beef  .
 And lots of other delicious foods, and we drunk, drunk wine, and  .
 Yes.
 Oh, they gave --- gave us the photo service  .
 And a little cake.
 Actually, I like all.
 Choose one.
 Best one?

 Because I just like it.
 I'm not sure, because there is so many variety  .
 I agree.
 Because I have a   allergy about smoking, so if there --- there is a smoker, I can't come in the restaurant.
