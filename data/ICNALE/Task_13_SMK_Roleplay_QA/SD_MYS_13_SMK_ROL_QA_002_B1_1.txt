Um, a cozy place.
Nice environment.
Ah, we had - yeah, we had nice food.  The service was fast.  Um, luckily the - the customers there did not smoke.  Okay that's good for them because we cannot - you cannot smoke in public area.
So yes, I think that's all.
Um, okay I think right now ah, I like the Korean dishes, okay.
It's kind of viral, it's a viral thing here in Malaysia ah, with chicken - spicy chicken with some Korean thing there.  Ah, compared to the foods that we usually eat I guess that's kind of nice for everyone to try it and taste how Korean food taste like.
Um, yes I agree with them.
Because um, if you smoke you - you are not like smoking for yourself.  You are also affecting other people around you so that they can become second-hand smoker.  Um, sometimes we can see that in the news the one who ah, mostly surrounds smoke smelling the smoke of the cigarettes die early than the one who smokes.
So I think restaurants should ban smoking in the area but they also XXX  make this smoking area but if you want to smoke please make it like a bit far of the place.
