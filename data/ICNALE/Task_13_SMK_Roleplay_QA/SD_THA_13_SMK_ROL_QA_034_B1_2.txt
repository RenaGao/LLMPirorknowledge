Uh, two years ago, before I - before I go to Japan, uh, at some trip with my - my parent, not - not my family, he is uncle, and they bring me to - to buy the stuff for going abroad and we have a - we have - we have ate - we have ate in a Japanese restaurant.  We have all, uh, the family member together.  It's a - it's a really - really lovely memory.
Because of the - we have - I have - I had mom and dad together, all of my brother, my grandmother, my grand - my - my aunt.
Yes, all of them.
I would say Thai restaurant.
We have - we are Thai people.  Uh, I have - I have experienced it.  I went to Japan for one week, but the food is good, but then I came back and I ate - I ate the first meal in Thailand after one week.  You know, I - I kind of like crying with the meal.
It's - it's really - is some kind of home sick or something.
Yeah, it's - it's - in my opinion, it's - it's - it's the best.
I agree with that because the restaurant is a - is a kind of community area.  You have to share the space with other.  And smoking is - is affects other.  You shouldn't do that.
