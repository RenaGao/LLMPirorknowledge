Mm-hmm.
Uh, my friends and a colleague was working in a Vietnamese restaurant.
And at that time, I didn't have any experience eating a Vietnamese food.
Uh, and she invited me and she was working there.
So, at first, I was not really into that food but I eventually went to Vietnam to eat the food and I really into the food these days.
Best?
Uh, you see I like Vietnamese food the best.
Because they serve a very decent dishes.
And they are a lot cheaper - cheaper compared to other foods.
Hmm.
Oh, as you talked about, uh, smoking box should be in the restaurant or caf�� but I think outside the smoking box smoking should be prohibited very seriously.
