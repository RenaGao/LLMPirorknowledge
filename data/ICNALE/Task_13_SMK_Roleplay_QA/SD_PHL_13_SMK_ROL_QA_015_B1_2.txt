Yes, I have a lot of experiences ah, eating in a restaurant together with my friends and family.  For me, eating together in a restaurant together with your friends and family is not just eating, but it is also a bonding time with your friends and family.  It will help you to talk about several topics, to, to know about each other's lives.  And it will also improve your social life as well.
I like Filipino restaurants.
Because in, in the restaurants, this is what, what I eat every day and it is my comfortable food.  So, eating in a Filipino restaurant will, will help enjoying my food.  I'd be able to eat a lot.  I'd be able to, to satisfy my cravings.
I strongly agree about that policy.  And I want to be, I want that to be a policy, because first smoking is really very bad for the health.  I don't see any reason why a person should smoke.  It will not affect, it will not just affect his or her health.  But it will also have, you know it will also affect the health of other people.  Ah, if we cannot totally ban smoking, then we can use the funds for, for the health, health, healthcare improvement in the country for those other people who do not smoke so that we can still benefit from it.
