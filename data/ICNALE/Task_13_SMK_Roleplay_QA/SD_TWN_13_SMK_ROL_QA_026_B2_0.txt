Um, good experience.  I think a good restaurant for me is to be quiet, uh, not just silence, just, um, there are no lots of noises of people, no loud music and the meal must be tasty.  Not - it doesn't have to be really delicious, just be tasty and - and I think you have to have the reasonable price.
Um, I like Taiwanese restaurants the most because, um, Taiwanese food is the one I keep myself most used to.  So, I think I like that.
I disagree because I believe there are lots of smokers.  They smoke because - because of some ambient factors like there - they need to relax.  They need to relieve from their pressors.  Or they have to, uh, get along with other people.  Or they have to maintain their relationship through the tobacco sharing, some kind of that.  So, I think smokers are inevitable.  What we need to do is to have a place for them to smoke.
Yes.
