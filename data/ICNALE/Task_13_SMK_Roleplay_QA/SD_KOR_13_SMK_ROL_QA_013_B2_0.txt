Hmm, there was a Korean traditional restaurant.  Usually, they don't serve courses - course meal but there was special course meal and me and my father and my brother was there.  Well, my mother was working there so she wasn't able to come so my father ordered like course A and there was a lot of dishes, and it really taste good, and my brother doesn't like to eat some Korean foods but he really liked it so it became my family's best choice.
I prefer Japanese because like for Chinese, I've been to China and I have tried some foods there.  There was a vegetable called XXX , that was really tastes - it really tastes like a grasshopper.  It just tastes like an insect so I really didn't like it, so I don't want to eat Chinese food but when it comes to Japanese food, I really liked Ramen or Sushi and Sashimi so yeah I prefer that one.
Even though I'm a smoker, I agree with that because in a restaurant, there might be kids or someone who is sick so they have to behave well or put some manner on it.
