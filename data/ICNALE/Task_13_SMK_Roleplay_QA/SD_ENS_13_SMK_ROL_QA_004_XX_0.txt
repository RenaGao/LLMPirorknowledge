Yes, it was at a restaurant in England called Gaucho.  It's a steak restaurant.  I love steak, yeah, and especially compared to Japan, its steaks are much better in England, so I had a good time.
Uh, I prefer non-Japanese restaurants.
Mainly because I have a certain taste palate, and I like the stronger flavors of other countries.
Well, coming from England where smoking is banned indoors in most places, I agree.  I am a nonsmoker myself and I don't particularly like the smell of smoke.  So I - I agree that we should ban smoking in public places indoors.
