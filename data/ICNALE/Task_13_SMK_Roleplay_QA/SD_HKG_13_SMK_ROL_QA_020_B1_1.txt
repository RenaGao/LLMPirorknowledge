Uh   mostly I would like to have lunch, um - I would like to have - I have lunch, uh, with my family in some Chinese restaurant.  And, I will talk one of them.  I - we have ordered some food and we think that the food in that Chinese restaurant is, uh, good and tasty, and the peop - the customer there and, uh, also maybe some noisy but, uh, it's not very loud and most likely I appreciate the food there.  Yes.
Which one?
Only one.
Um,   I like Chinese restaurant and some Canteens  .
Because I live in Hong Kong and most of them are Canteens   and Chinese restaurant, maybe have more branches in Hong Kong and I - can I say also I love, uh, Japanese and Italian also, then---
Uh, because I can, uh, know some of the culture of that restaurant.  Uh, for example, I can taste the food then outside Hong Kong and maybe some, uh, sasami or sushi that are quite tasty and they have lots of choice to let the customer to choose.  And I - for the Italian food, uh, there is some spaghettis and that's also good for people to eat.
I agree that smoke should be, uh, banned in all restaurant because, um, the smell of categories are - are quite odorant and the - I can endure that kind of smell and also I see - I think that, uh - um, I see some research about when you - after you finish eating, smell is, uh, one kind - one of the categories will - equals to 10 of them so that - so it is - it will harmed, uh, the people's health, uh, therefore I think it should be banned.
