For me the good restaurant actually, they divide between the smoker and nonsmoker, so we are free for the smoker, so we can enjoy our food because the smoker is not disturbing us to eat.
Yes.
It's a big restaurant because for the - for the - the smoker place it's really far for our place to eat.
Yes.
I like Indonesian restaurant.
Because I am not usually like eat for the sushi for the Japanese but it's not too match with my tongue.
Yes.
Yes.
For me, I am - I am so agree for that.
Yes, but in our side, yes, I know that the smoker have a maybe for the addicted to the smoke, but for me, we should ban for it because it's - it's disturbing for the passive smoker because for the dangers is more dangerous for the passive smoker than active smoker.  So I really disagree if it's only divided into two places like for the smoker and a nonsmoker.
The passive smoker, if we are not - like we are no smoke - we are not smoking, but actually like there is a smoker that - that's disturbing for the passive smoker.
So, it's like for the - like for the smoke is disturbing, only disturbing.
Based on my experience is - and my father, also my father is also a smoker, uh, my father is going to the park - to the parking only for smoking.  After smoking, he decided to go back to the our food - our food place.
Yes.
