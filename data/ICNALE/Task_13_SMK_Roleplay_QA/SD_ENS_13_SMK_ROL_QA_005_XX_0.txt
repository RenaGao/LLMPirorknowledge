Yes.
Uh-huh.
Uhm, at the restaurant.  There is a place that I went.  I can't remember exactly where it was down south.  It was just like an IZAKAYA   type of place.  It was very nice like it wasn't - it was very unassuming.  There was just plywood everywhere, but it was a very relaxed atmosphere.  And we were with, you know, a nice group of friends, had some drinks and just ate some bar food.  It was really nice.
What type of like food?
Nationality?
Ooh, uh, I think maybe Italian is my favorite?
Because I love cheese, like pizza, any kind of pasta that has cheese in it, like carbonara or things like that.
Hmm.
Uhm, well, there has been a lot of scientific studies on the effects of secondhand smoke.  So I think, you know, it has been banned in America for a pretty long time in certain states.  And it was a little bit jarring for me coming here where they don't have that rule.  So for me as someone who has asthma, that's something that I can appreciate but I understand that certain societies haven't really caught on to that yet.  So I would say, yes, it would be nice.
