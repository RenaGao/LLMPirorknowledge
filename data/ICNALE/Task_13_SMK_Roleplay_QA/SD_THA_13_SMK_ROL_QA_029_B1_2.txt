Um, good experience?
Uh, experience - um, it's Fabio's restaurant near the college, that I went with my family last month.  It's - the atmosphere was good, but it's crowded of people all the time, but however, my parents liked that taste of that Fabio's restaurant.
Um, Thai restaurant because I don't like, uh, smell of Japanese food.
I - I think that, uh, most restaurant in our country is try to - try to welcome every age - every person such as children, so they want to make the restaurant available for people, so they try to, uh, stop smoking person in their restaurant.
Yes, I agree with this news.
I think that if - when a child see an adult smoking, it's like, uh, the smell is not - for me it's - I don't like smoking person, yes, so I think that is like creating some image in children minds, yes.
