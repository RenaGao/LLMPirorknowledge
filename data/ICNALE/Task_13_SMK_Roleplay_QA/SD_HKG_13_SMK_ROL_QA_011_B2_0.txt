Um, I - I just - I have, um, seldom went to those, um, hotels for, uh, for XXX   with my parents and - and some maybe, uh, Japanese restaurant with my friends.  But I think nowadays the price of those, uh, um, foods or drinks is, eh, a - a bit, uh, high bec - I - I don't know whether it is due to the increase in living standard, uh, I - I - when - when - when I pay for those food and I - I seldom feel that the - the quality or value of food is, um, uh is suitable for those high price.  Um, so, uh, this may be some, uh, special feelings regarding to, uh, my - in my experience to those restaurant.  And I think the - maybe the taste or - or the desire of food, uh, is very similar in different restaurant, so, um, I don't have quite, um, experience in - in - in my past experience to those - to those restaurant, yes.
Um, I like Japanese, um, restaurant the best because I like eating sushi and, eh, udon and those and I - but, eh, those restaurant also as - eh, often offer some, um, uh, discounts in - in this food so I - I often go to Japanese restaurant with my friends to consume those food.  And I think, uh, Japanese food is really, um, wonderful because, um, they - we can choose from a variety of sushi in different types and different taste, uh, also there - the - the - in - in some restaurant rest - uh, in some sushi restaurant, they offer, uh - uh, offer a - a trend to deliver the - the sushi to your - to your - to your desk.  And I think this is, uh, quite a interesting design to - to reduce the - uh, reduce the worker and - and provide some, um, in - interesting, uh, design to the consumer at the same time.
Um, I agree that, uh, smoking should be, uh, totally, uh, prohibit in the restaurant because, um I - as I mentioned smoking is really, uh, harmful to - to both the smoker and non-smoker since the non-smoker will, uh, even suck those, um, smoke when smokers are smoking.  And this will increase the chance, uh, uh, in getting lung disease and - and as I mentioned, uh, we - we go to the restaurant for dining to the - uh, but we are not, uh, uh, assume that - we do not assume that we need to, uh, uh, emit those, uh, smoke when - when we are dine because the - the smoke will really reduce our appetite and also affect the taste of the food, so I think, uh, it's really be banned in all restaurant, yes.
