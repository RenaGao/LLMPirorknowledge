You want - can you repeat the question back.
Oh, in my opinion, my personal opinion.
I don't really care about the restaurant as long as it is hygienic and it is comfortable and, hmm, and when we are eating together, everyone feel very satisfied and happy.
The service, hmm, the service if possible the - the workers they should be doing their work properly and I understand if they - there are many customers in the restaurant, but if they are not - they do not have many customers over there and they just delay the orders and you make the customers feel upset.
So, I will say that the service is bad.
Yes.
Which one, hmm.  Japanese.
Normally.
Because to be honest I like I Japanese food.
Especially their sushi.
Noodles.
It's kind of feel - it's kind of feel like well there is a caf�� in Malaysia.
Yes.
Yes.
Strongly - strongly agree.
Because it is unsafe for other customers and it would affect other customer or other people.
