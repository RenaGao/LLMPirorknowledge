That won the world championship.
It was very fantastic.
Because, uh, the pizza's taste is very - was very good.
And, uh, the owner explained, uh, the menu.
And how to eat them.
Yeah, it - it was very good.
Mmm, uh, I prefer Chinese food.
But someone is very not good for health.
Uh, but ---  I'm - I want junk food because it taste - tastes good, it's fine.
Yeah.
I agree that.
Uh, I'm non-smoker.
And when I go to restaurants, I'm always, uh, call to restaurant and I want a non-smoking area.
