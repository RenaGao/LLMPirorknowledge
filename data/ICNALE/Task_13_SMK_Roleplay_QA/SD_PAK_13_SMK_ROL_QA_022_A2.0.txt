Yeah sir, when I was in Quito I went to, mm, uh, Serena hotel with my family.
So, I went there and I got my meal there.
Yes sir.
I think I prefer to Pakistanis...
...hotels...
...because there can be our favorite dishes, in other hotels there, uh, there cannot be dishes that we love, that we like to eat there...
...so.
Yes, I agree.
Because whenever someone is smoking, other people may not enjoy their meal and they may - they may be disturbed by them because, um, when someone is smoking and other one is - is busy in eating, so, uh, one cannot enjoy his own meal there.
