Umm, one of the best experiences that I had was when we have eaten in a restaurant - it's - it's another restaurant - umm, with my friends.  And there we ate a lot of food, then we have enjoyed their service.
I think I am going to choose Japanese restaurant because umm, given the fact that I am more into Japanese anyhow though.  I think I am much into discovering their culture and with the food that they're serving I - I think that I am going to discover umm, more of the Japanese culture.
I agree.
I agree because smoking is really dangerous to those people umm, who are using or who are smoking and also to those people who are smelling the smoke from this.
