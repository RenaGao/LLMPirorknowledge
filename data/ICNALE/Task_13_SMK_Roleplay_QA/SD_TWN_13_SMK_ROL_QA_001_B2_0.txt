Good experience at a restaurant?  Um, like uh, every New Years or every, um, Mother's Day, we will go out and, uh, go to really nice restaurant or like the State House or some, uh, or the restaurant in the hotels and we will have dinners.  Um, one time this was, uh, because my birthday is in May and it's really close to Mother's Day.  So, we celebrated together and then, we - we go to the XXX   State House, um, to have meal and, uh, they heard it's the birthday and the Mother's Day.  It's all together.  So, we had - we took the pictures and it's a little bit awkward, but I sang the happy birthday song and then, we eat the birthday cake.  I think it's very sweet probably because they took the picture as a gift.
Uh, I like Japanese restaurant.
I like sushi and - and mostly because of the food.  I like sushi and miso - miso soup.
Yes, Japanese restaurant.
Totally agree.
Uh, hmm, like I mentioned above, I think the smell of smoke could, uh, could not really taste.  Uh, the smell of smoke, uh, is really bad for customer to taste the smell of the real food.
And restaurants should - should help the customer taste the best the food should be.
