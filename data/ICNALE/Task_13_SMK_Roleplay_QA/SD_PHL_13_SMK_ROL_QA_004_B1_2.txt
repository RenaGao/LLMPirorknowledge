So if I am going to take the example of the restaurant that you had given - the example I gave, no, I think smoking should still be allowed in restaurants but they should be in a separate area, and the restaurant that we ate - that we have eaten, there is a separate area for smokers and drinkers and there is a separate area for non-smokers.
