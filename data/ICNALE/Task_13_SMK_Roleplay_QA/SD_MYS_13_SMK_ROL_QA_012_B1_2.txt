Yeah, yeah sure.
Yes.
Well, I have once ate a dinner with my uncle because I was meeting his client, uh, from, I think he is from Thailand.  So we are eating a meal at a I can say a four-star restaurant.  So that was a huge deal for me because, uh, I am a kid from a small neighborhood.  So we don't like eat that fancy food quite often.  So for me to have that -- that fine piece of meat to eat with so much flavor is -- is for fortunate and I feel so satisfied by that time.
Yes, it's a good experience.
Yes.
Uh, for me I would -- I would like to eat in a Japanese restaurant because for me, uh, I'm a guy who, I don't want to sit on, I like ordering Japanese because, uh, as we know Japanese has a very very good culture, so for me I -- I personally like to -- like go and discovering this fancy and delighted food.  So for me to test because I -- I watch Enemies, and Japanese drama quite often.  So for me to see that that food and to see them it was so much pleasant is a pleasure for me.
For me I -- I highly agree with that.
Because, uh, as we know that, uh, cigarettes in particularly can be so harmful to the smoker himself because they have things that make our lungs to corrupted.
So but they are higher rates for someone to inhale the smoke from the cigarette because the cigarette for the smoker their filters.  So when they smoke they can release and the people beside or near you inhale so they don't have the filter.  So they are probably higher risk to get a an infection.
And problems so when someone is smoking and then they release that -- that nasty smoke for me it's quite disgusting.  I don't like that experience because you are trying to enjoy that food and then you -- you will forced to inhale that bad atmosphere for me this is disgusting since we like that food a lot.
Yeah.
