Yeah, as the Chinese, I like Chinese food.
I don't think they are very good here.  That was not good because the taste - they don't like the real Chinese food but maybe Japanese like it that.
There was something changed for Japanese because that was - the food was too sweet, maybe Japanese like to eat sweet food here.  But in China we don't like that.
Yeah, yeah, it's not very simple to say you agree or you disagree.  It depends.  You know, some - yeah actually in, you know, that everyone knows, okay, smoking is bad for healthy but, how to say, some people say smoking can lose the pressure and when you have some stress you - we have a - a cigarette, you feel loose. But you know, when you are smoking, I don't - actually, I don't really to hate the people who smoking.
But with smoking, you - you actually to go to the smoking area - area, because when you are smoking at the people who - something - someone that really don't like that, they will hate you here, and the smell maybe not very good.
But smoking like alcohol here, alcohol, you know, alcohol, someone like to drink, someone don't but you can't say - but were you - was someone who liked my drink, you cannot to say, hey, you smoke the alcohol here, I don't like you because I don't like alcohol.  You don't - you don't have that right, right?  Everybody has the space - right to choose his life.
Someone choose cigarette, someone don't, okay, it depends.
