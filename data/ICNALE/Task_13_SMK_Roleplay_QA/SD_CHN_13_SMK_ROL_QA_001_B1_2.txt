I disagree.
Yes.  Uh, uh, I - I didn't smoke but I think we shouldn't, um - we shouldn't - don't - do not like people smoking all over the country's restaurant because it's not fair.  Maybe, we should divide smoker and non-smokers but if you don't - don't like the smoke XXX  it's not fair for the smokers.  We should be fair for everyone.
