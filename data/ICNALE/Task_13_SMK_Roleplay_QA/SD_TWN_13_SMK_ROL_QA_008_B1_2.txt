Um,   I think, uh, if a restaurant that, um, is clean and the staff there is friendly and that is good restaurant and I think many restaurant in - in our - uh, I think most restaurant is have - have good.
Um,  .
Oh, yeah, have good environment and - and friendly staff.  Also - also - also their food not taste so - so they should ban - their environment is good.
  I think still Chinese food.
  Because Chinese food   um, because I prefer Chinese flavor and - and - and I seldom to go to our Thai restaurant.
Um, I think, um, in restaurant still can smoke but they should, um, divide those restaurants into two areas.  One can smoke but one cannot.
