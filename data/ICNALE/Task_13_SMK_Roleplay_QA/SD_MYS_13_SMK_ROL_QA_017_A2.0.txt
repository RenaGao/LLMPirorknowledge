Umm - my experience - ah - I like the comfortable restaurant with a good air, good food for me to enjoy it, and usually I used to eat - I don't like to eat fast food because it is crowded and also people always come and we cannot find seat.
Ah - I like sushi in Japanese  .
Ah - Sushi King - because the - the style of their - when they put - when they serve the food and also their ingredient which is not too oily and not too salt - not too India food.
Sorry, can you repeat?
Yes, completely agree because you know the smoking change our mood and also the environment can turn into bad.  The smoke smell too bad for us when we enjoy the meal so it's not good and uncomfortable for me.
