Well, one time I go to - I go to a restaurant with my family and the rest - we have a - we have a - we have a good - we have a good dinner in the restaurant and -   the environment is good and it's - the restaurant is good - okay.
Yeah, very well.
Well, I like Chinese restaurants because you order - you order - you order a meal and - for - for one, for two and you'll share with your - you'll share the meal with your - with your fam   - with your members or with other people.  And if you go to Japanese restaurants, they - they order maybe just one for one and you don't have that much communication.
Communication?
Yes, I agree with that---  
---because restaurant mostly is in - is a inner place and for in inner place you have - you don't - you shouldn't the smoke - smoking this - smoking this behavior will affect many - uh, many people.  And if you smoke the atmosphere will just be destroyed.
