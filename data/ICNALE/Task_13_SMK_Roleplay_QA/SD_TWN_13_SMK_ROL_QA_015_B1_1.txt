I just went - I went to a restaurant XXX  ---
---before with my family.
I think the atmosphere is - was very good---  
---and the dishes were very delicious.
I prefer the American's restaurant.
Because I like to eat steak and hamburgers.
I disagree--- 
---because some people are addicted to the cigarettes.
We should not just force them not to smoke.  We can just build an area to - to avoid the smell---
---to - to - to - to reach us.
