My good experience at restaurant maybe in Thailand.
Well, it's a very high building.
And we sit at the toppest  floor and we can see the all Thailand view---
Especially in the afternoon, the sunset, the sun is already setting down.
And light is so good maybe a little orange and the blue is so good.
Of course Chinese restaurant.
In Japan, it's not logical, yeah.
Uh, because, uh, maybe it change the taste.
Uh, okay, it's okay but, uh, it didn't reach my - my - my - my heart's taste.
Yeah because I'm come from XXX 
Sorry.  Uh, we - we eat a lot of rice.  Yeah but maybe the - you can see from the title, the - the - the name of the di - dish is rich but---
Yeah maybe a little sweet.  Yeah, I can't believe it.
I agree.
Uh, smoking maybe - will never disappear from the world.
The man maybe also the woman will smoking.
Yeah but---
But when they smoking and eating, yeah at the same time, maybe they can't control their self.
Yeah they want to smoke.
So, I think they should, uh, part - uh, part the restaurant.
Yeah put the restaurant in two parts; smoking and no smoking.
And they will have the wall maybe or XXX  the smoke will never get out and the no-smoking part and the customers will not confuse about it.
