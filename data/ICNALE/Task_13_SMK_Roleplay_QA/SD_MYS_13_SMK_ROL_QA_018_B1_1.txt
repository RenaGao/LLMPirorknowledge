Hello miss - umm - sorry - hello miss - umm - last week, I ate - I went to your restaurant and there are - there are a group of people who are smoking, so I need to leave you restaurant, but -umm - still there are - still I cannot - I not eat anything.  So I want - so I want a refund to - to my meal since we are not eating yet. Could you consider that?  And I hope after this, you need to be strict to your restaurant which prohibit the smokers from smoking inside your restaurant to - to make sure not distract the other customer to eating at your restaurant, thank you.
