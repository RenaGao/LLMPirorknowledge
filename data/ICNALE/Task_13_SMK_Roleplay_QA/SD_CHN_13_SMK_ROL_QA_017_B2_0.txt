Yeah, okay.  Um---
Yeah, because of mix good experiences to choose. 
In my memory, there's a - anyone, um, I - I was with my boyfriend last - last Christmas yeah and go out to eat pizza and, uh, yeah, so much different, uh, delicious food and, um, uh, because he - uh, he was - he was in China, uh, and Japanese so we don't have a lot of - a lot of time to be together, and last Christmas, and it was really impressive that I, um, come back to - come back to China, yeah, and have to really good, um, meal with my boyfriend.
Chinese.
Um, yeah, it is okay for me, and I think, um, uh, it is not easy, um, for Chinese people - uh, can't eat the Japanese food in Japan, although it's not - not real one - the real one, but, um, it's, um, uh, good enough for me.
I disagree with it.
Yeah.
Because I think, um, this - smoking is the personal choice - if the man want to, um, smoke, uh, he have the right to do this.  And I - I think just to give them the, um, specific area to smoke at - it will be better.
Yeah, I hate - I hate the smell of the smoking but I don't think it is right to, um, don't - uh, don't let all the people who smoke.
