Yeah.
Uh, yes.  There are different restaurants who provide a very comfortable environment to us because every restaurant there is a competition between the restaurants that one - one of all and every restaurant try to give more and more comfortable environment to their customers so that they can visit them more and more.  And the experience which I get the most that there is restaurant at the river side, what place, near our place and that gives a view of the river and there is outing and XXX  and that would be more, uh, recreational and excited experience for me to having meal there.
Yes, various.
I like to mostly go to Pakistani restaurants which are having Pakistani meals.
Because I never have experienced the international and I also don't like these even fast foods 
That's why I mostly would like to go in Pakistani restaurants.
No, I don't agree with them.
Because smoking is a need of the people.  Nowadays if we look our - uh, look a glance at our, uh, surrounding, we mostly see that it could be the need of the people and people mostly go to the restaurants also.  That's why they have to sit and they have to smoke.  And I prefer mostly that there should be a smoking area specified to them that they can sit there and easily smoke after lunch - after meal after lunch and before meal whenever they want to do because there is a trend that people has smoke - smoke a cigarette after lunch are made.  That's why mostly there should be a place so that they can go there and after meal they can smoke easily.
