Umm, umm, maybe Japanese restaurant.
Yes, because - you know I like Chinese food so much, but in Japan the - the Chinese - the Chinese restaurants are not - you - you know it's not - not the same as really Chinese restaurants.
So, the - maybe the Japanese-Chinese restaurant.  So - so as a Chinese I - I think it's not very - you know - um - as a Chinese I just don't like the foods in the Japanese-Chinese rest - restaurants, maybe Japanese people like maybe.  So, uh, in Japanese restaurants, um, there are many choice for the food and you - you can choose something you like.  There - there are many, you know, French food and I just don't like the French food.  But there are also other choice like fish or something, I like fish and I can choose fish.  And there are always some salada , I like vegetables so I can eat salada  in Japanese restaurants.
Umm, maybe not XXX .
Yeah.
Um, I disagree.
Actually smoking is bad for health and but there are still a lot of people smoking so if - if we - if there are no restaurants can smoke so how the - how - how do they go - go to eat.
