Restaurant good experience?
Mm-hmm---
Any restaurant.
When I was a child, uh, I and my family go to a restaurant to have a meal and it - it is, uh, great restaurant.  It has some, uh, some---
Uh, it has, uh, meat meal and it also has some food park like some sushi or, uh, spaghetti and some other kind of food.
American best.  Um, I most like the Japanese food.
Because Japanese food will be more simple but is also very beautiful and very tasty.
I agree so because I don't like, uh, smell of smoking everywhere, so---
Yeah.
