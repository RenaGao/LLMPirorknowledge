Any restaurant or?  
Well, we had this family gathering and we were very pleased with the service, because it was fast.  And not only the service, but also the quality of the food, it was hot and it was new.
I like best, I like Japanese best, Japanese food best.
Because I, I don't know.  Ah, I think I was, I got used to it, because when I was a kid, at first I didn't like sushis.  But then, we, we went there again and again and I kind of liked it and I like it until now.
I do agree with this, because a restaurant is a place to eat, not a place to smoke.  If ever uh, bosses or some people wanted to smoke, I think it's best to have a smoking area rather than having the restaurant umm, having the restaurant be allowed with smoking.
