Hmm.
Um, I had one experience like eating, uh, sushi in Japan with my friend and then we have wait - waited for like four hours for that restaurant and although that was really long of - waiting for - for getting to eat, but, um, it was quite surprising that the food was so good.  I especially liked the - the sushi that the sasami was, uh, very like fresh and I haven't like try sushi like this before and so that was an unforgettable experience.
Yeah.
Um, I like Japan - Japanese food the best because I like eating like raw food so I - I - I like, you know, sushis and sasami that's why I would choose Japanese, uh, than other any choices.
Yeah, I totally agree with that because, um, smoking in - inside indoors area is really bad to other people because they - they are actually innocent, they - they don't have to be affected by you.  So if you really want to smoke, you should like go out of the restaurant and - and you can smoke your cigarette there, yes.
