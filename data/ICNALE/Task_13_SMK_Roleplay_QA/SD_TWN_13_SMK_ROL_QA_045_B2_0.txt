Mm-hmm
Uh, I don't have any like very good restaurant because I have a - this like, you know, I just taste everything.  I just look at every kind of restaurant from 1 star to 5-star restaurant and just like it.
Good experience?
Of course, I - I do have a good experience.
It's just that, um, there are some particular food that very outstanding and astonishing because when I was eating, I thought this is going to be a bad food, but it's not just what you imagine that everybody eating.  This is like habit.
It is something that you have to learn it, you have to eat it again and again and again.
Yeah, I don't really care about the environment, I just only care about the food.
I can't say like what restaurant I do like because I just like everything.
Everything I like.  I just - I just be there as the judge whether the food is actually good or edible to other people.
Smoking?
All restaurant, 100%, 100% I agree with that.
Because first of all my family used to be a smoker.
Not like the whole family, just one - one member.  And I was still the kid, but I already understand that smoking is actually bad, not just for the smoker, but also the - those who, you know, passive smoker.
It's also - being a passive smoker is also bad.
So, I really, really hate smoking even if your - uh, my girlfriend ask me, can - can we go to the bar for a bit, you know, having a drink for - for refreshing also.  Okay, but at least for an hour, not more than hour, why because if - if we have to go to bar, then we have to be passive smoker.
And we can't hold the smoking for more than an hour because that's going to be bad for our health, so it's better if we go to there only for an hour and have a drink - a quick drink and then we just left.
