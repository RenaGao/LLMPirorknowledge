Yeah.  So I have been to one really, really fancy restaurant with my lecturer and there it's the service is very good, the waitress is very kind and then especially the food is very, very delicious, very, very good.  And yeah, you know, that's really one want to make us to go back there.
Yeah I think I'll go for Padang restaurant yeah because it's really, really, really, really, nice.  Maybe people think it's not healthy to eat Padang food or they have a lot of fat, have a lot of oil.  But yeah, you know, people are relative, so, yeah, yeah, I really like the Padang restaurant yeah.  
Not really.  Uh, I think it's not really totally banned but it's - yeah, you need to separate the smoker and with the nonsmoker.  So, the nonsmoker can enjoy their meal properly and the smoker can still smoke happily without disturbing other people.
Yeah.
