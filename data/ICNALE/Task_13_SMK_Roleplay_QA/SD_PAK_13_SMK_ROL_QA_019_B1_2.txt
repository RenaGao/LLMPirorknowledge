Yes.
It's been a really recent memory.  Um, we have been to a restaurant.  My brother and my - one of my one of my cousin and I was there.  We enjoyed a lot.  It was late night and we were very hungry because as I told you that we were enjoying in the - used to go to park often, so we were coming back from the office in the evening - sorry, we were coming back from the park in the evening and we went to the restaurant.  We placed an order.  Then, they served us whatever it was, it was really delicious.  We cherished - we enjoyed it a lot.  We did a lot of good conversation and it is a good memory.  We made a lot of pictures, so.
I used to try different restaurants, so every time I go to restaurant I go for different.  And if you ask for the favorite ones, so I used to, uh, pick up the restaurant that is very famous in our city.  So, most often I used to go there.
