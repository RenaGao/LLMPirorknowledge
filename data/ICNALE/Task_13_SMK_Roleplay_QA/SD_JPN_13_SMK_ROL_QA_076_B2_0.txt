 ---and he had many experienced working, uh-uh, working in the famous hotel or --- he owned other restaurants too, so he was very ex --- experienced uh cook --- uh chef, and also the meals was very perfect and we really enjoyed the---  
 ---uh eating.
 The best?
 Umm, recently I --- I really like eating Japanese food restaurant, Japanese --- in Japanese restaurant.
 Really?
 Wow!
 Uh, disagree, disagree, disagree.  
 Because so the --- for some people the smoking is very his um important hobby and we can set the --- uh we can uh develop --- divide the smoking area and non-smoking area and we --- the people who don't like the smoke can go to non-smoking area and uh enjoy their meal, so if uh just we --- I think we just set the --- divide the area, that's all.
