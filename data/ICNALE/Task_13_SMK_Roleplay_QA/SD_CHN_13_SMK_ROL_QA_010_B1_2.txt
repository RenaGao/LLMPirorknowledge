I like to go, uh - going to restaurant to have a, uh, dishes.  Good experience?
Uh, I have going to, uh, the Osaka station - on this restaurant near Osaka station that's called Dancing Club.  That's have seafood and my friend is just that day have a, uh, birthday, and they just celebrate for us and have a dancing and good drink.  And - yes and a cake put that for us, so it's a good experience.
No.
Because - that cake we - we should paid, uh, about 1500, yes.
Yes, free dance because that's - the name is, uh, dancing club, so club - yes.  It's Tokyo - Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka maybe.  Okay, thank you very much.
I like Thai restaurant.
Because, uh, the spicy dish is good and it's - when you feel hot, it's - it's easy for eat, yes.
Yes and I like spicy and---
Yes, it's good.
I - I agree with that because, um, smoking is not only about the smoker.  We can smell that - uh, everyone can smell that, so, um, it's influence us, so I think maybe it should be, uh, abandoned.
In - in recently, there's no - uh, new, um, cigarette - like, uh, IQOS electric, so I think maybe if - if they really can't give up smoking, maybe that's a better choice.
And - and I - I - I think it's - it can - it can have least, uh, harmful.  So, also not only for the smoker, also to another people.
