Uh, for good experience in restaurants I think that, uh, the waiters in, uh - in a restaurant is very important like they are politeness and kindness will actually really give a good impression of the restaurant itself.  And the food of the restaurant should not be like the quality or maybe the ingredient should not be, uh, com - should not be, how to say, like, uh - should be unique, I would say, to really - to really make you feel special about the food as well.  I think these are really, uh, important for restaurant.
Uh, I think, Japanese restaurant are really, um - would be the one that I think, uh, the most enjoyable, uh, because like, uh, for the food wise they really, uh, focus on - on the smelling of the food, and they also focus on the looking of the food XXX   of the food as well as the environment.  They really try their best to, um, have their restaurant designed, um, and have the sense of, uh, Japanese culture filled.  And that what made me feel enjoyable.
I think smoking should be banned in all restaurant because like if you really want to smoke, then you can just simply, uh, leave the restaurant or just walk - walk outside the restaurant and - to smoke, like there is - is not necessary to smoke in the restaurant like you - you know that smokes affect the other customer as well.  You don't want to, um, not - you - you don't want to affect them, uh, eating their meal or have a eat their food as - at all.  So, I think it should be banned.  Because like there is - how to say like there is a effect on other people as well, not just yourself.
