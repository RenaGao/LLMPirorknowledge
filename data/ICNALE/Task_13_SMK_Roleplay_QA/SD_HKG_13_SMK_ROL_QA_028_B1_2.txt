Uh, some restaurants, that well, hmm - let me think.  Uh, there might be some restaurants that I enjoy going to but my friends and family don't but usually I just go with my friends and family instead of making them can't - can't go to the restaurant that I want to go, so, yeah.
Uh, I can't think of one at the moment.
Um, I actually like those Hong Kong style restaurants like Cha Chaan Teng because, uh, there are like all sorts of things you can just choose from, like from spaghettis or Chinese noodles, you - you have basically everything that you can think of, yeah, but Thai restaurant is also good because, uh, I kind of like Thai food, yeah.
Yeah, I agree that, uh, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Hong Kong because, well, you are in a restaurant, you are supposed to eat, if you are eating then you are using your mouth and then you are smoking as well, then what - which one do you want to choose, eat or smoke, you can't do it at the same time.  So, yeah, I think that smoking should be banned.
