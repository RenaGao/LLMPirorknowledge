Good experience.
Um.  I have been to a restaurant and its service is very good.
Yes and its meal is delicious.
So, my families all like it.
I like the Korean.
Because I really like spicy.
Then, Korean food is very spicy and it's kinky, I like it so much.
What?
Allow what.
Smoking.
I agree.
I don't like the smoke.  Yes, I think it smells bad and it will hurts our lung.  So, I think it was right.
