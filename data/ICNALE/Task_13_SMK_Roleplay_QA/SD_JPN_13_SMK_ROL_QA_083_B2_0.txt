 Thank you.
 Good experience, uh.
 Um-hmm-hmm-hmm, uh, good Experience, um-um, uh.
 So, let me talk about my uh study --- study abroad uh in this summer.
 Uh, I went   Philippine uh this summer and uh, uh everyone in --- in Philippine uh ex --- except me was uh Filipinos or other country uh from other countries' people.
 So, uh, I --- I didn't have friends, uh, uh, no, umm, um, so uh I --- I didn't have friends, but uh, uh when I went to the restaurant in Philippine and drink some alcohols, uh, we can uh umm we can talk very casually, so it was very good experience, uh I --- I could make friends in restaurant.  
 Uh, I like uh Japanese food restaurant, uh because uh in some cases, uh, uh, Chinese restaurants or uh for umm, umm, cuisine of foreign uh is too uh fatty for me.
 Hmm.
 Umm, umm, I disagree uh umm uh I agree with the opinion, as no one, uh, no people umm everyone should not smoke in the restaurant, uh, because uh umm actually it's a right to, right, uh, uh, umm, um, smoking is a right for every people but uh smoking to harm --- harm to other people and restaurant is very uh small place to smoke uh smoke will do harm to other people.
 So, uh, everyone should smoke uh in very uh open space.
 Uh, so uh when we, uh, when we smoke, we --- we should go out from uh the restaurant.
