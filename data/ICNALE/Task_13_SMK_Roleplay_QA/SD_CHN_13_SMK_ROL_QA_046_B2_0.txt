I want to introduce my experience in - in a hot pot restaurant, called Haidilao, so you must have known.
You know that restaurant is famous for their good service.  They all - they all have good manners and you can - uh, you can have - you can enjoy their hot pot and - uh, and eat some snacks either.  And---
I - I often go there with both my families or friends, we all like there.
I like - mm, I like the Japanese restaurant the most - the most--- 
Because - uh, because my flavor is light and I can't eat spicy food.  And you know most of the Chinese food are really spicy.  And that make me feel very uncomfortable.  And - and the Japanese food are - are light relatively.  And I like their food like sushi or, uh, salmon.
Mmm, I - I think their ideas are very good.  I am supportive of them.  And - and you know when people are eating, uh, they don't have - they don't want to, uh, inhale some other hazardous - hazardous gas, so, uh, people just want to enjoy eating and smoke - smokes can make - make them feel very - very uncomfortable, so, uh, have a policy to ban smoking in restaurants is definitely necessary.
