Um  , last time I went to a Korean food restaurant in Mong Kok and actually is with my friends and it's - the design of the pot is very interesting because I have to pour - pour something - pour - pour out on plane - something to smoke - to get the smoke out and however my friends always forget to get it down so the smoke is affecting all people around and finally the service - servicer is come and helping us to get that thing down.  And I - and we look at my friend because - and we look at that friend because he is claimed that he will do that thing all the time but he always forget it.
Uh, actually, I like the Italian food because Italian food is - it's like pizza and some spaghetti and some - it's like the rice and focaccia and that is more easy to make at home.  I love trying making food at home so.
Restaurant, I am not really sure.  Is it one Italian food in Causeway Bay, but I still can't remember the name?
Actually, I agree with it.   
Because smoking will affect the smell of the food and even stick on the - in some chemical or material stick in the food or the clothes you wear so I mean it's - it's very dirty so I will suggest to not to smoke at the restaurant.
