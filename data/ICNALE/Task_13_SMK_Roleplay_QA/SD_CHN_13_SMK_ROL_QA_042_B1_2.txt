I think XXX   is a good example because the - whatever you want, they will - they will, uh, provide to us.  And the people there is very soft, so we also - we often can have a good dinner there.
My friends.

Chinese restaurant.
Because the food in our country is better for us and the food in the foreign countries like America, they often eat hamburgers or French fries, mm, mm.
And Chinese - Chinese foods have a lot of types.
So - so for the choice is more.
I disagree.  Because - because our country has a - a huge population.  If every - every restaurant forbid smoking, it may be - it may be - uh, it may be have a lot of problems about using - I think it's a good way to set a - set a - a room or someone else to - for - for the smoking one.
In this way, they - they can smoke in and others also come - also come have dinner better.
Yeah.
