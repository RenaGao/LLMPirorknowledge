It was a long time.  I don't have much time going out with my family, but---
My friend - um, uh, okay, um, that day I went to cafe with my friends, uh.  The café is the café - café and we ordered the tea - green tea and peach tea and we took a lot of, uh, photos at - I can't remember that, the group - the three of us comes - came to that place to - the first group of the customer, but we went out the - like when we went out, we are the last customer went over that place.
Um, Japanese restaurant.
I prefer - uh, I prefer Japanese food.  I like sushi and sashimi, yeah, and if - it's better, uh, eating sushi with, uh, Wasabi, yeah.
I disagree because, um, the one who is smoking, he - they has a right to smoke but all the restaurant have to make it clear that the restaurant prohibit or improhibit, that area is allowed to smoke or not.  Not, uh, to control the people.  I think the restaurant is the place just to make those people clear that this area is not for smoking.
