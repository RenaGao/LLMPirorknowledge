Sorry.  I like - like that one though.
See, I - I like it because actually I would - I wouldn't call up because, you know, if I hadn't done more research in the first place, well tough XXX  .  Yeah.
I guess.
Uh-huh.
Okay.  Just one?
  hmm.
Yeah, yeah.  Just trying to think of the best one.  Sorry.  A second I think.
Well, I do have many stories, but one that I can vaguely remember was in a Japanese restaurant that hadn't been open very long in Taisho, I think it was.  Now, when I choose a restaurant, I don't really choose according to the price.  I choose according to the feel of the restaurant, and the feel for me is created by the particular staff working there.  I went into this restaurant, and the staff seemed very friendly, quite nervous because they had hardly been open a couple of weeks, I guess.  But as I was eating, they did come over and ask me how well I enjoyed the meal, and I thought that was unusual, and yeah, pleasant experience I guess.  Yeah.
Uh, I prefer to cook at home actually, but well it depends on who I am eating with.  If someone who has just arrived in Japan, I would love to take them to a Japanese restaurant.  Somebody who's been here a while and wants to try some Indian, I will take them to an Indian restaurant or wherever they want to go.  I don't really have a preference.  Just provided the atmosphere of the place is nice.
It's kind of a question where I take sides.  It's unfortunate that laws have to be instigated at times because it's a sign that people's mentality isn't correct or their mannerisms are down.  Umm, personally I don't think any law should be enforced; however, there are people that just tend to lack manners, so perhaps at least designated areas should be assigned to restaurants, yes.  Particularly when the children are out.
Does that answer the question?
