Um, I think when my mom - on my mom's birthday.  Yeah, we go to the, um, XXX   so I don't really know how to say it.
Yeah, the French restaurant.  It's not like the restaurant but you know to place you have meals and it has a stake or some spaghetti, meat balls, like that.  So, we think it's enough - it's good enough.  So, uh, we go there and - and oh, because we can buy the - a cup and we can just drink for the free.  You just need to buy the cup and we can drink all you want.  
And we still order and a cake to celebrate her birthday.
And after meals we can still go to shopping.
So, I think it's really good to - to have a meal there.
I usually like the - like the Japanese because I like the Udon and - and some fry - fries - fried meals like that and, um, oh, and sashimi.  I like sashimi. 
But sometimes I will think about the - um, the food is trash or not.  So, I won't order sashimi very often.  Almost every time it's Udon.
Um, agree because I don't smoke and the smoke is - is - will interfere my meals.
