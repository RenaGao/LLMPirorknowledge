Uh, my good experience to restaurant is mo - mostly to the buffet as I can eat whatever I want and I - I don't need to care about, uh, how much I need to pay afterwards as a - no matter how - how many food I intake, eh - input in my body and I still - I still get - can just pay the several fee, uh, that a fixed, uh, fee.  So I like buffet, eh, and it's a good experience for me.
Um, I think I like the Japanese the best as, uh, because, uh, they have a - their - their food and also their menu is really good and taste good, but, eh, also their service is the best I think among all.  So Japanese is the good - the best.
Um, I agree that, uh, as, uh, there are many people different kinds all walks of life, uh, in the restaurant and some people maybe pregnant women or some child is, eh - they cannot maybe, eh, it's - if you smoking, eh, there and it will really affect them, eh, their health very seriously.  So, I think to be more, um, compassionate and forbidding smoking is, uh - is a must, eh, in all restaurant.  And maybe they can just provide some smoke place for the people to - uh, for them to smoke in some several places, uh, to - maybe to avoid others to, uh - to maybe, uh, affect by them.  And, yeah, some people, uh, even don't like, uh, the smell of smoking, I think to all - to all goods, uh, they need to forbid in all restaurant.
