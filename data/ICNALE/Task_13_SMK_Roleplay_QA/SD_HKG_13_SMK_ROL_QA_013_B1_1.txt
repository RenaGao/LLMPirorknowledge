Um good - um, I think one time I have my - I have like birthday dinner with my family in W Hotel and because I - I know that was - that was my birthday and the rest - and the hotel, restaurant, they - the manager they will know it and they have prepared like some surprise - surprising event or surprising cake for just unique for me only and for that case they have served us very good and whenever we - we have any request or any enquiries, they also fit our wants and help us to do lot of things and because from like my dad have - is driving and they also provide us the free parking and help us to contact with the like - contact with the taxi because we have drunk - we have a little alcohol at that night and they advise us not to drive and help us to - help us to call a taxi and for us to go home also, yeah.
Um, so myself I like Japanese restaurants the best.
Because I love Jap - Japanese food so much, and because I don't really like those food with a very - with so - with spicy or some of them are having like Chinese food which might have, um - which might makes you feel not uncomfortable becau - because of the smell of the food or the taste that it was really like.  So, for Japanese food it could makes me feel comfortable and it is good taste of because they are - usually they focus on the food is on taste and they do not add too much of the ingredients to make it - to make the food to be better, so I would like to enjoy Japanese food.
Actually, I agree for restricting to ban all smoking in restaurant because while you are eating in a restaurant you if - if you allow them to smoke, it might cause some accident in the restaurant also and for the - and it also unfair to those non-smokers.  So, if they want to smoke, they could after the meal, then they will go some areas which is allow smoking and then to continue their smoke, but not while others are having their meal and there is just directly, eh, smoke besides and it will really make people feel uncomfortable, yeah.
