Yes.
Well, great customer service, great food and a very short wait time. 
Family and friends, umm.
Let's see here.  I cannot think of any specific restaurants or - well, possibly just the ones I usually go to.
Okay.  Well, the food is - the salad is always fresh and um, the staff would always pass by asking if you wanted anything more and they are always smiling.  And whenever something wrong, they are able to um, remedy, like there is no water here or you know - you know, the salad bar is like empty or  
It - it was a non-smoking restaurant.
Um, I have a lot of allergies so it's always like restaurants where they serve meat and no seafood.
With a little seafood - if anything is cooked together with seafood, even if it was steak, I would have an allergy attack.
I get hives, trouble breathing, and I sometimes lose my voice, but one step higher means I would probably go on to anaphylactic shock.
Exactly.
I would disagree.
Um, I actually agree to smokers' rights but at the same time I do not want to eat a meal where there is a smoke - or the smoke - the smokers and non-smokers are not divided equally.  Or if I can smell the smoke, then I am not going to eat at that restaurant.  But there are people who just - like you mentioned earlier, I am more on your side about smokers' rights and yes, they have rights to smoke but I think as long as they as long as they respect the rights of the nonsmokers.
