 Uhm, I - my hometown is Kanto area.  So I'm living alone now but the last autumn my father come   to Kobe for his business trip and we enjoyed dinner in Sannomiya.  The dinner with my family is very interesting and fun.
 We order many dishes and we enjoy eating with speaking many things.
 I like Japanese type.
 Because I'm Japanese.
 I think it is good but I like Japanese food.
 For example, sushi and soba.
 If they want to --- some people want to smoke they have to smoke in their home and in the public place, they have not to smoke, it is a place to   every one.  This is not the place for the smoking person only.
