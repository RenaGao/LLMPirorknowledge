Okay.
Uh, I like to talk about the experiencing in Haidilao, is kind of - is one of the most biggest chain restaurant - chain hot pot restaurants in China.  And I think almost everyone know that restaurant.  It's famous for its good service.
I remember the first time I went to the - I went to the hot pot restaurant, it was 5 years ago maybe.  Uh, I went there with my family.  Uh, I was totally shocked because there were a lot of people that waiting for the table to have their meal.  And so when we queued up to - uh, to wait for our table, uh, they - the waitress just provide us - provide us a good service.  They - they provide our - the drink, the snacks, and I - I think - I think it's quite friendly.  And when we - when we were having our meal, they are very considerate, uh, and most importantly the - the food is really delicious.
Mmm, I like Chinese restaurant best because - and maybe because I'm a Chinese and I - my mother and my grandmother always cook delicious Chinese food for me.  So, I think I'm prefer - I'm a - I'm a pretty used to that test.
Yes, that's right.
I totally agree with that.
Because I really hated the smell of the smoke.  While walking in the street with secondhand smoke around me, I always felt sick and kind of uncomfortable. 
I will tell them hazard of smoking.  It is bad for their health and is also bad for the - for our health so.  That's it.  
Yes sometimes not and I - I won't make friend with them anymore.
