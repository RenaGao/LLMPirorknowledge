Well, last time when I went to a restaurant with my uncle to have a meal at night, uh, we ate some kebabs with naans and it was raita with it.  The food was very savory, very tasty.  We ate to our fill.
And we hall was very clean.
Well, I don't like the international foods.
I like desi food.
Because it relates to me.  I don't eat much and what I eat is our indigenous food.
I agree.  Smoking should be banned at every cost.  
First of all, it is a non-productive thing.  Secondly, it affects other people sitting around you, and third thing, most of the people start smoking by looking at other people.
