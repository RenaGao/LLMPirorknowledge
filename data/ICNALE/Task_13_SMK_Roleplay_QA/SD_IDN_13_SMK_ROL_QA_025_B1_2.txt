Hmm.
I think when I go to restaurant there is some people with the leftover food and then with the dirty plate and dirty glass.  But when I saw a person or me and my friend who eat - together eat around in the circle, in middle of the uh desk - in the table and it's make employee to take it easier.  I think like I help the employee to do their job.  I think that's - it's not, it's not a positive for me but I think it's a positive thing to do.
Ah the food is good and then feel when I go to that restaurant it's so relaxing and I can spend my time more than in the other restaurant.
I think the price is affordable and suitable for me.
I like the Japanese and Indonesian food because I think it's suitable for my tongue.  And I like Japanese food.  The taste - the taste is so strong and I like strong taste one.  But I don't really like the spicy food one.
I really agree with that.
Because smoking is so annoying - well, is annoying thing to do and then like they don't - they don't know, they don't - they don't care about the people when eating and then suddenly there is smoke everywhere when we eat and so annoying for me and I cannot tolerate that thing.
Okay.
