No, I am just---
I am just thinking about, yes.  Uh, yeah, let me talk about the good experience in Japan just maybe a few weeks before.  And when I went to a restaurant because - because of the custom reason, I didn't eat pork.  So when I went to XXX  and there the - I - I just asked them if there is any pork in the noodles or something, they just told me that yes, and we cannot - and we cannot make the special dish for you and I just feel really sorry for that.  And I just feel - feel really bad for that.  And then my friends just said, uh, okay, let's - let's see what - what else can we do and have only the - maybe the kind of manager or something, he came - he came and then my friends just told him about that maybe he can do a change in the dish.  So he - he actually did that for me, so I feel flatter and---
Uh, I think I like sushi.  Not the expensive ones, because the expensive ones are only for - but one time, and I actually choose the KAITENZUSHI .  I don't know what's that in English, and I think this is really nice.
Uh, actually in - in China, I didn't really go into the Chinese restaurant because we have kind of types for the - uh, for - for one types is for - um, they didn't have any - uh, they didn't have any pork or the meat of dog or something, and other type just the Hana restaurant.  So - so I choose that one.
Well, I - although I just - I just - I had a role play card about that - that - that the angry customer but I think it shouldn't be banished because - yeah because many people love smoking and because of the pressure thing.  And - uh, the - the most thing we can do I think is just to divide the area.
Well, I really don't think about that - that situation you mentioned.  Umm, well, yes - uh, yeah, as for me, if I go to - if I go to somewhere with my friends, I prefer not smoking.
