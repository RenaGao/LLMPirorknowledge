Uh, good experience, um, yes, for me, uh, when going inside a restaurant, the first thing that I consider is the customer service, the waiters and the staff of the restaurant have to be very, very nice to you.  Uh, so you can have a very good experience because - because if you have a really bad customer service, then it will really uh, affect the way, uh, you uh, eat in the restaurant.
Uh, I like the Japanese the best.
Because of the taste of the food, the cuisine and also how the - the people um, cook it.
Uh, I agree and disagree.  Uh, it's I agree, I agree that it should be banned in uh, mostly in public areas.  But if it's in your own vicinity or house, I would - it should be allowed.
