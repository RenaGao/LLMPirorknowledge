Uh, a few weeks ago, uh, my family, uh, have a very good meal in a local small restaurant because we - we know they - uh, how can I say - we are familiar with the owner of that restaurant and we are good friends.  Uh, uh, I have to say, uh, spending time with your family members is quite good because you are talking, you are - how can I say - laughing.  We have really good meal and we actually have, uh, private room to spend some time with each other, uh, so I have to say it's a quite good journey.
Uh, although I am a Chinese, I prefer the Japanese restaurant because, you know, most of their food is diet and less salt.
Yeah.
Of course, I like.
