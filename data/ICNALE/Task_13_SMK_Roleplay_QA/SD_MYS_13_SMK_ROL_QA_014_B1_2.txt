Umm.  One that came across my mind is---
---at a restaurant in Subang area, near my house.  Um.  The name of the restaurant is  Gold Chilie .  Serve the very best, uh,  butte  chicken.
Yes.  One day, I was, um - one day I was, uh, having a meal with my friends, and there is a guy sitting next to us, he was smoking.  And my friend started to have asthma.  And luckily, uh, she had the inhaler with her.  Then, she  com  - we complaint to the restaurant owner, and the restaurant owner, uh - uh, luckily, they had the, the, uh - the guy was very cooperative, and he sat at outside of the restaurant.
The owner set up the table himself, and to - for the guy to sit.
Yes.
I like the best?
Thailand restaurant.
 Yes  because, uh, all their menus are something spicy which I crave the most sometimes.  Yes.  It's very, uh, authentic dish of Thailand, you know, that, like Tom Yum---
Yes.  So, very spicy and very delicious.
Yes, I agree.
Because, um - uh, we as people, not all of us smoke, and not all of us can tolerate the smell of cigarettes---
---by me.  So, uh, if you want to eat, of course, you want to eat in a condition where it is, you know, easier to breath, comfortable.  So, I think, if, uh - if not, uh - if smoking is not prohibited, maybe, uh - uh, lately, the Malaysia have, uh - have  this policy of three meters away from the, uh - from the, uh, restaurant, uh, if you want to smoke.  You have to stand three meters away from the restaurant.
So, it's a very good, uh - it's a very good idea.
Yes, I agree to that.
