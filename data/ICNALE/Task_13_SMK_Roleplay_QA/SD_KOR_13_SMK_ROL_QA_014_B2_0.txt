Yeah.
Like you mean the name of the restaurant?
Uh, okay.  Uh, our family usually go to buffet.
Because, um, the each peo - each persons are really different.  Like in my family, like I like some seafood and my sister likes meat so we can't make a decision---
---when we go to eat some foods---
---so we usually like to go to buffet.
And we mostly likes to go to - the name of the rest - name, umm, what was that?  Kingdom.
It's the name of the restaurant.  It's really large and quiet.
And there are so many kinds of food.
So, we love there and we go to there like twice or once a week.
Yes.  I would recommend.
Uh, I like Japanese food like Sushi.
Umm, it's not grossy like - like Chinese food or fast food is too like heavy---
It's too heavy to eat or - I think Japanese food is - when I ate it, it's really like cle - I think it's little clear like it seems like that.
So - so I love the Japanese food.
I'm not a smoking people , so I love it but there are so many people who are smoking, so I think we have to make a smoking area inside the restaurant, so they can smoke at there and non-smoking people have - have some - like they got - like they have to make smoking area so both of them can have same rights.
I think it will be great like---
