My good experience at a restaurant?  Well, does it have to be a - a service or---?
Well, actually, I'll just say it is not easy for me to think of a good experience.
But I do remember some bad experience.
Well - oh, yeah, actually it was at a Japanese restaurant.
Um, and the staff there was really - really friendly and - well, actually that day was my birthday.
Thank you very much.
And what - actually before - before we go - we went to that restaurant, we called them, well, whether it is - it is possible for - for me to bring my birthday cake there.  And they told - they told me "okay" and well - well, actually, after I took out my birthday cake there, they even sung a birthday song.
Well, I would say it was a little bit embarrassing because there are customers around me, but it is moving.  It's touching.
Absolutely Japanese restaurant.
Because, uh, I like Japanese cuisine because it is not that oily and I think it focuses on the - the food itself without any - some additional seasoning, and well, especially compared to Chinese cuisine and French cuisine.
They're not.  But - but it is necessary for them to do some arrange and it is also true for, you know, some French food and Japanese food in China.
I disagree with that.
Well, although personally I hate smoking, but I think it is a kind of - a kind of freedom for people who do smoke - who like smoking.
Well, for - for instance, maybe in a restaurant.  Well just - just separate them to nonsmoking seats and smoking seats.  I think that is enough, and well, completely banning, I think it's not necessary.
Umm, I don't think there is any problem.
Because---.
Well, they, you know, just get separated in a very short times.
It's - I think it's not - it's not such a problem.
