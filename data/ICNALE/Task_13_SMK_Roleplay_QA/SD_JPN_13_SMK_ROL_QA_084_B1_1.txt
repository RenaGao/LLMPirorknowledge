 Smoking uh, umm, smoking have --- smoking has bad effect not only for smoker, but also the people around the smoker.
 So, umm, if the restaurant or other shop --- store umm don't separate the area, uh, the people around uh his or umm him or her umm automatically receives the bad effect of smoking.  
 So, I agree with that opinion.
