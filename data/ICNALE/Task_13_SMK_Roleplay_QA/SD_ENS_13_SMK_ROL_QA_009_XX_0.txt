Uh-huh.
I recently went to a restaurant in Harborland, Brasiliano serving Brazilian, yes - I really don't know how to describe that, Brazilian  
XXX  .  You know the one that I am  
That one XXX  .
Umm, I like the slightly different vibe given that it's a Brazilian restaurant in - in Japan and it's - I mean I like fish too, but it's - it's very wheat focused which is a little different from some IZAKAYAS  .
Uh-huh.
At the risk of contradicting myself I actually prefer IZAKAYAS   mostly.  I prefer the traditional Japanese shops.
I just feel that living in Japan that that's the - that's the - the kind of restaurant where the food is most likely to be authentic at a reasonable price.
Yeah.
I come from Ireland, which was I think the first country in the world to completely ban smoking in anywhere where there's an employee which obviously covers all restaurants and - and bars.  And there was a large amount of uproar initially when the ban went in but that was many, many years ago, now and most people, even smokers agree that, uh, it was a good - a good move.  So, I personally am not environmentally anti - anti-smoking, but if I have to choose which I - then I suppose I do think restaurants and bars should be smoke - smoke free.
