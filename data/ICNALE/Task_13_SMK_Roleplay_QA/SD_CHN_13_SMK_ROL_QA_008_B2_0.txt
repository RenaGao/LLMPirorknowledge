Good experience is, uh, the whole family get together.
The - the whole family get together in the same area.
Delicious food and is better than home-make food because the cook there is very famous for cooking some local food and offering a - some special dishes, and I can't usually eat much at home, but I can at this food in the hotel or some restaurant.  And the food XXX  is enough for people who like to eat a lot, like me.  And this is amazing because I usually go to the restaurant and cannot get enough food because they just get very small piece of meat and that's all.
Lot XXX  the restaurant.
Maybe some roast meat, that's Japanese restaurant meat - restaurant - because meat roast - beef, pork, chicken, a lot - a lot of meat and is no - few vegetable.  And I can eat 2 hours and not stop.
That is wonderful. 
That's XXX  you can keep eating.
Yes, actually that's not - absolutely not, uh, traditional Chinese restaurant.
Because the - the flavor is closer to Japanese food because the - yes, just to - to satisfy Japanese customer, they have to change some of the ingredients and some food - some food material have to change because the - the - the food culture is different between Chinese - China and Japan.
Fully ban maybe, uh, a good idea, but that is impossible. 
Because people - they don't smoke, they get anxious because they just get addicted to smoke.  Maybe we can offer them - them smoking area in some corner or some toilet - near the toilet I think.  They can just go out - walk out, can smoke outside, and they come back.
