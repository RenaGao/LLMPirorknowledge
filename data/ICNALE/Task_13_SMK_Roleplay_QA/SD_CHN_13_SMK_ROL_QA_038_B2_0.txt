Yeah.
Yeah, I want to describe the - mm, let me think, yeah, with the mention of this topic the first, uh, experience that, uh, hits me is the one when I was in Heidi Hof with my family.
Yeah and that time we went to the restaurant because the whole family greeted, uh, uh, congratulated me, uh, for my entry into university and as you know Heidi Hof was very famous for its service.  And yeah and the waitress, uh, knew that we were celebrating something.  So, she - uh, so she give us a lot of presents because we have four elderly people, uh, my grandparents.  Uh, so, she gave them each some, I don't know how to say it, XXX  .
Yeah and I think, uh, it was very considerate, yeah and it was - uh, it left me with a deep impression.  So, every time I want to eat hot pot I will choose Heidi Hof, yeah, because I think the service is very good.
Yeah, that's all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
  mmm, Chinese.
Yeah because I am a Chinese and the taste of, uh, Chinese cuisine, uh, uh, I'm really used to eating Chinese food.  So, uh, I really like Chinese cuisine.  So, yeah.
Yeah I like it too.
Yeah.
Mmm, agree
Uh, because I think, uh, in public places like restaurants, uh, smoking should be banned - uh, smoking should be banned for, uh, everyone has its right to enjoy his or her meal in a good environment and for people who don't smoke, uh, restaurant with, uh, smoking, with, uh, cigarette or all kinds of smoke that caused by smoking is really not that enjoyable.
Yeah, so I think for public places smoking should be banned for everyone's right.  If they really want to smoke, they can choose another place or they can eat at home.  Yeah.
