My good experience at the restaurant, oh my good experience at a restaurant is that I didn't know what I was eating was fish.  But I thought it was beef.  So, that was a good experience, because I was like oh.
Yes.
I think Japanese restaurants.
Ah, one is that they are very respectful.  It's that they, though they are not Japanese.  I guess they were leaning up to the culture of Japan, Japanese people because they are very respectful.  They greet you when you come in and they greet you at the table.  Yeah, they are very respectful.  Other than that, that the food ah especially, I love the food in Japanese food.
Oh yeah, restaurants, family restaurants, I do recommend people banning smoking from there, because they are family restaurants.  But if you are saying the resto-bars, which is different place for people, I do think that's okay, because children are not allowed in restaurant bars there you know, if then.  So, I do think, yeah in restaurants like family restaurants, you should ban smoking.  Totally, it's a good idea.
