Again?  Sorry.
Umm, I think umm, the good experience in a restaurant is that the food   is umm, very kind and we can approach them easily and they - the facilities are good and I can see that umm - it's - there are - the - the facilities - not is organized and I mean, the facilities are organized as well as the staffs of the restaurants, and they serve food umm, very well.
Umm, I think I - Japanese restaurants.  I prefer Japanese restaurants because I want to try umm - umm, Japanese food aside from what I have tried before.
I agree sir that smoking inside the restaurant should be banned because umm, you have to consider other people as well, not just only yourself.  So if you're going to smoke it should be umm - you have to be distant with other people because you don't know their conditions.  It might be bad for them so, umm - smoking inside the restaurant should be banned for me and I agree for - and I agree that.
