I'm sorry.  Come again.
It would have been - especially in Japan most of them are pretty interesting.  I see a foreigner come in and they will say, "Oh, tall guy, what are you doing."  They try to speak English and yeah, depending on if it's a restaurant or bar they all start speaking their broken English to me and everything like that and maybe you know offer to buy me a beer and get a free English lesson.
Ah, my best favorite restaurant I would say would be the Hard Rock Cafe.
Well you get American food.
I'm liking hamburgers, big cheese burgers and fries.
Okay.
I disagree because everybody has the right to smoke even though it's not you know healthy and you have to have you know opportunities for smokers to come in your restaurants too.
