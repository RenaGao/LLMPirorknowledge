Uh, I have went to a restaurant called XXX  .
And the food there is very delicious and beautiful, uh, there in the summer vacation.
Uh, although it is very expensive, but I think I have a great time there and it deserved.
Uh, I think, uh, that day after we had the meal, it's - I'm going to - uh, my brother is going to know his grade and the, uh, entrance exam for college.  So, we don't know if he will, hmm, had a good grade or a bad grade, but it is time to celebrate for his, um, hard work before.  So, it was to have a great - uh, big meal before that day.
Hmm, Japanese restaurant.
Uh, because I like the things from Japan and I like sashimi, uh, and the meal in Japanese restaurant is usually very delicate and beautiful.
Hmm, maybe disagree.
Because, um, some situation like the bar or something like that, um, it is important, hmm, or they need to smoke, then that kind of person there, they need to smoke and have some, uh, social activity with others.  And if we, um, don't allow them to smoke, it may be a, uh, little bit difficult for them to start a conversation.
