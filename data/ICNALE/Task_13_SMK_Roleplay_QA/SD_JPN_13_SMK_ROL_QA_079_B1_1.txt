 Thank you.
 Uh, uh, yes, I want to, I --- I --- I like going to restaurant.
 So uh I, uh from I became a student in this university, I --- I went a lot of uh restaurant in Sannomiya and Motomachi in Kobe uh with my friends.
 And the my friends also like   restaurant.
 So and --- and I --- we went   a lot of uh a wide uh variety of restaurants, especially uh um-hmm uh, uh we went   a good uh umm good shop, atmosphere is very good.
 And --- and the uh a very --- a --- a very casual restaurant.
 Uh, for example, umm, in the wall, on the --- on the wall, there are a lot of picture or some books about uh music or uh, uh, uh, and so, so---  
 Yes.
 Umm, I --- I think, umm, uh, I like Japanese restaurant as --- as uh the more, uh, the most relaxed place.
 Uh, I think that it is, we uh we are Japanese, so we can most feel relaxed in that --- the restaurant.
 Uh, I disagree that the idea, because, uh, uh, in fact, it is, uh, uh, uh, we cannot uh remove --- remove smoking completely, in fact.
 So if uh if the, uh-huh, if we ban smoking, umm, there are a lot of people already uh make people already, uh, umm, there are a lot of people who already make it rule to smoking, so for them, umm, um, and I don't know precisely, but for them, it is uh bad for their mental or umm, umm, uh, umm another --- another thing.
 So, I disagree.
