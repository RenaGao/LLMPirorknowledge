Good experience?
Umm.
Well---
Last month.
I went to XXX  with my boyfriend.
And we found the - we just walking along the road and the seas just behind us - uh, beside us, and then we casually walking and we found a restaurant on the second floor, and there was a big window and the sunshine just spreading on - on our table, and we are having some - just some simple food, bread and, uh, salad and XXX , well, and he's taking my picture when I was 18, and it felt very sweet.  Okay, very great story.  Thank you very much.  Okay, sorry.  Okay.  There are various kinds of restaurants around here; Japanese style restaurant, French style restaurant, and Chinese style restaurant.  What type of restaurant do you like the best?
Uh, I would like to eat Chinese food.
Umm, that's true.
I - I think in Japan, the Chinese restaurant very, uh, taste are very good, but it's not like in China - not really Chinese food because---
Uh, yeah.
Well, maybe I - I say maybe suppose I see or saw something, just using Japanese source to make Chinese food, I think, is not real taste of Chinese food.
It's not so - I think it tastes so very good.
Umm, well, I - I don't smoke but I know that many people, they like to smoke.  Umm, I know it's very bad for human's health, but exactly in some place they allow people to have some drunk  even - even have some drunk  but they forbid to - people to smoke. I think that's ridiculous, and I think it's better to, uh, separate the place.
One in - one place can be smoking and another place, no smoking.  I think it's better - it's very - it's fair for everyone.
Well, we will---
Of course, no.
Umm, because I - I'm not smoking, so my friend will respect me, and we'll go to the place, no smoke.
