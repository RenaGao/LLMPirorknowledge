Yes, we have enjoyed meal at Swastika and, uh, though - uh, this restaurant was very nice and this restaurant, uh, located in a very famous city and we go there and the - uh, the waiters and the manager are more conscious about their meal, and they ask about their feedback, uh, how they are - uh, how you like - like our meal and if there is some complain please tell us.
I didn't like French, Italian or Chinese, I rather focus our like, uh, uh - my own culture and the food from XXX  culture.
Because the food, uh - uh, because I am a - my taste developed according to my country and I didn't like to feed upon Chinese, French or Italian.
Uh, I am agree on this that---
Uh, because the restaurant is the area where you sit and you can talk about - about your life and about your - uh, about your profession or anything that happen in your life and going on in your life.  And you want a stable and very, uh, clean area that you can express your ideas.
