Yes.
Um, my - when I go and have a dine out with my family we, um - once in a while we actually go to like some fan - fancy restaurant.  And I think the - and the environment is good because, well, first of all, I, uh - I do not enjoy people smoking around me and that's what, uh, Hong Kong restaurants manage to do pretty well because, well, no one is allowed to smoke indoor.  Um, when I go out with my friends, we go for more, uh, budget option.  Uh, it is - well, just because it's budget, it doesn't mean that it's not good, uh, I enjoy - actually in Hong Kong I - I found quite a few good restaurants and I think that even if my friends come visit me from other countries, I would take them to eat around Hong Kong because of the variety of food that are, um, available here.
Yes.
Um, to, uh - to be honest I am actually a fan of French food, uh, French restaurant.  I think because we eat slower actually allowed to talk to people because when I meet up with my friends, we, well - we have - actually haven't seen each other for a long time.  And I think a long meal just allows us to talk more about our lives and tell each other how we're doing lately and French food is a good, uh, well, good is not good enough, uh, they are really pretty XXX   and they are of high quality.  And so I am actually - I - I actually look quite - I am a quite a fan of French food.
Yes.
Um, I think that depends on your definition of a restaurant, whether it is - would you call a bar a restaurant because a bar actually provides food but you call it a bar and there is other areas where people are actually allowed to smoke.  So, I think that really depends on the type of restaurant where you are talking about.  For example, school canteen, of course there is, uh - it is a school campus, of course, smoking should be banned completely in this, uh, area.  Whereas, if we're talking about, uh, let's say, Lan Kwai Fong, there are a lot of bars.  They are also restaurants but then they have open areas and they also provide food but then you can't really stop people from smoking in that outdoor area, although it belongs to the - the owner of the restaurant.  So, I think you could try but I don't think it is very feasible to do so.
Yes.
