 Uh. When uh --- in   my birthday of last year uh with my uh --- I have --- my family and I went to a steak --- steak restaurant.  
 Near my house.
 And in --- in that restaurant uh the cook --- cook and --- the staff and cook uh, uh, celebrates   my birthday like uh magical or---
 Magic.
 Uh, a cook do   magic before uh in front of us.  
 And --- or --- they --- uh they play uh some uh tam --- tambourine or umm---
 And uh, uh, many things. So  
 So, uh, I --- I --- I was very uh impre uh, uh, we --- I enjoyed very much in that restaurants  .
 So, uh, I am --- I want to go there next time.
 Uh. Uh. They give uh free photos or uh some uh --- uh I don't know, but maybe some uh ca --- uh --- I --- I ate uh cake --- birthday cake.
 Uh. Yes, free.
.Photos
 Yeas, yeah, yeah.
 Umm. I like uh the Japanese restaurant.  
 Uh. Because, uh, I --- I don't like the uh food with very --- a lot of oil or strong uh taste.
 Uh. So, in umm --- in many Japanese food restaurant   uh umm the food is not too uh oil   or not strong taste. So, I like the Japanese restaurant.
 Yeah.
 Hmm.
 Uh. Yes, I agree with that opinion because a restaurant is where uh people enjoy food.
 And uh smoke --- the --- I think smoke disturbs the --- the food --- uh the environment to enjoy food.
 And umm I --- I --- I agree that --- uh, uh, I --- I see that uh, uh some smokers enjoys   uh food with smoking.
 But uh, uh, people around smokers don't --- doesn't --- don't feel uh good. So, uh, we --- uh I --- uh, uh, the government should uh, umm, make restaurants ban the smoke in the restaurants.
 Umm.
 Umm. Yes, I --- I --- to some --- uh --- uh, we should respect their rights to some degree but uh, uh smoke uh makes uh many people uh very un --- unhappy.
 So, uh, we should uh restrict their uh place to smoke.
 And so, and I think today's uh, uh, uh, uh, environment for non-smokers uh is --- is not enough. So, I think uh government should uh, uh, make the environment more easy to uh the --- for non-smokers.
