Okay.
Good experience, uh, but it's a hard one because I---
No, I mean I often eat homemade food, so I don't really go out, maybe I buy some food sometimes but not quite.
In a restaurant, uh, recently I went to the - this restaurant, the Chef Corner one, it was in - uh, back of the university and this was quite good because, uh, it's - uh, Italian food and I find very delicious - I mean heavily delicious compared to the famous restaurant in the - in Bangkok.
And the price is amazingly cheap and the ingredients are good too.  I mean they are healthy and they are like homemade food because the owner make the pasta by himself and there are many different kind of pasta which is very interesting and amazing in a way because I don't - I didn't imagine that I would find an It - Italian restaurant - I mean the real Italian restaurant here in now.
Yes.
I prefer, uh, Japanese or any kind of restaurant that have rice for me to eat because I like eating rice.
Restaurant - well, I think it's - uh, it is up to the owner of the restaurant to make the decisions because I do not offend smoking peoples.  I - uh, I sometimes understand why they smoke, because I did sometimes but I did not everywhere stop smoking.  I - I think it's their right to do what they can XXX   owner.
