Uh---
Okay.
Okay, so, uh, in this - in XXX  like, uh, last summer because, uh, my classmate was going to, uh - to different place because he was one - he once was the staff there and before - before he was leaving, uh, I and the - the other classmate and I will go into his restaurant and - and I remembered, uh, he gave us like lots of discounts and even gave us lots of T-shirts and snacks, so I think it's quite a wonderful experience.
Taiwanese restaurant.
Because, uh, when - when every time I go abroad like, uh, the thing I - the thing I really enjoys, not the thing, the - the delicacy from the other country, but the - the food that I usually I eat, so I think I still love Taiwanese food.
Yes.
I do agree that.
Because, uh, for - I don't know if it's true, but like for lots of people, uh, like really cannot stand including me, uh, cannot stand the smell of smoking and - and - and according to the research, uh, the smoke - they - they produce, it's - like it's - uh, you were influenced your house and it's much worse than like the smoking - than the smoker's smoking zone, so I think they should banned it in all the restaurants.
