Okay.  Uh, I will - I was displaying a restaurant in China, uh, actually it's a almost like the same XXX  about the Kobe - Kobi Port and -ta ta ta Towers.
But the different is the - the restaurant in China there is the restaurant have a really big wheel under the restaurant and it can go the round around every time, all the time for us to see the wheels as 6 - 360, uh, degrees.  So it - it's a really good experiences that we can see the cities all the time and well we're taking a good, uh, seafood or steaks over there.  So, I think it's really romantic for me to experiencing that restaurant.
Uh, in Japan?
Of course Japanese food.
Because it's more local and the - as we - as I know the Japanese, uh, kitchen and the staffs are - have a really good and really clean stall and they're making the food really clean and sweet, no other kind of, uh, weird things.  I - and also the Japanese restaurant have a really good waitressing service, it really impress me really - really impressive.  Uh, that's why I really like the Japanese restaurant.
Um, I, uh - I think it should not be banned, uh, I mean I - I not - uh, think I agree that the smoking is a really bad thing, it's not only bad for our health, but also bad for our - for our, uh, emotional values.  Uh, but for some people they smoke not for - not only for smoking, not only for the satisfaction through smoking. Because they're upset or sometimes nervous or sometimes they are thinking about this, so that's why the - the - they lit up a smoke.  Uh, for them, and - and - and many famous, uh, fame - famous writers they like smokes.  Uh, so as long - and so in my opinion, as long as the smoking people could be, uh - could be separated, uh, certain situation, not interrupting other people, it's okay.
