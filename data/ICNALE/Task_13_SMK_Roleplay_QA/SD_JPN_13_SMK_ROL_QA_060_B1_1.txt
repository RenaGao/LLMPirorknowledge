 Umm. When I was in Italy, in the summer, I don't want to eat like umm steak or like with much fat.
 Umm. And at that restaurant, umm, they gave me the big salad bowl and that was so delicious, um-hmm, it's my good memory of that restaurant.
 Yes. Yes, big salad.
 I like Italian the best.
 Because umm I like Italy and umm I --- my father is Italian, so it's natural.
 I agree with it.
 Umm. Because many people, I think, don't like the smoke and smoking people can smoke at other place, not in the restaurant, so I agree with it.
 Umm. Yes, but the --- at the restaurant, you can like only stay there for 1 hour or 2 hour  , so the smoking people can smoke at other place   I think.
