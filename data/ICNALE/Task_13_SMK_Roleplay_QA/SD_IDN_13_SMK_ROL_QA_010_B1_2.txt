Yes.
Good experience.
Oh good one, good one.  Oh yeah.
There is a restaurant that my family and I all - there is a restaurant that my family and I always go but it's not in this city but the other city.
And it has a really beautiful scenery because it surrounded with rice fields and then tea factory and the service really good because yeah and the food is hmm good.
Yeah I love the scenery and the service.
Do I have to pick that?
Can I.  
Okay.
I like Indonesian restaurant.
Because I am comfortable about the taste and Indonesian always have - Indonesian food has the spicy taste and I like spicy because like western restaurant, it's really - it's only savory, it's only - it's only salty and kind of like - kind of like that.
Yeah it's not spicy enough for me.
Oh.  That's a tough question because my dad is a smoker.
I don't know it's probably restaurant can provide a place for smoker to smoke like private - private rooms so it's far from the dining room, far from the kids and something like that.  That it's not really banned.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
Yes, it's not completely.
I think if all - the restaurant will have less customers  .
Yeah, it's okay, like you can smoke at the car park or the car park or the - the garden if the restaurant has garden.
The open air.
Yeah not the place that everyone eats.
Far like 50 meters.
Okay.
