Um, the food is good and actually because I having my dinner with my friends, and we can have more XXX   share our experience.  Actually, it's the, uh, interaction with our friends is a better experience than---
---in the restaurant.
Uh, Japanese food.
Uh, because I like sushi and their - their food is very beautiful and they will put a lot of effort, eh, for the look - for the looking of the dishes.  It can attract the customer to it.
Um, I agree.   
Because in the restaurant, uh, not all the restaurant have window and this is the smoke - the smell will inside the restaurant and the smell is so strong and not all the people like this smell, and I think it will affect others so we need to ban.
