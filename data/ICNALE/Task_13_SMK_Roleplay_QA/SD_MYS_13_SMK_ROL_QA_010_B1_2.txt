Having a meal in a restaurant!  I have been to many restaurants in my life, but I think, I really go to a restaurant, the kind of restaurant that I really like is Japanese restaurant, because Japanese restaurants normally have a very, a more private eating area for a group when you are not really familiar, or I suppose to the table next to you, so you have more  
Privacy!  So, in terms of restaurants, I prefer Japanese restaurant XXX   of all the restaurants.
Yes.
I like the service, because, like, uh, in Japanese restaurants it is, like, the food is being delivered to you by robots.  So, like, they come to table and I think it's very convenient like you don't have people carrying food in the restaurants all the time, like, walking past by you, and also you could have like a sushi tray next to the table, where you can just like grab whatever you want and put it on your table.  So, I think, like that sort of, that is, that's a reason other restaurants don't have.
Yes, I agree with the statement because.
Because I think, like, it is not something that affect, it does affect, but it doesn't affect smokers at a very high level because, we only, when smoking and eating inhale, you can smoke at other area, so, because people come to eat and some--not many people have the best health conditions, some with asthma and some are people, are old people, kids, they don't - they don't come, they might have complications due to the smoke that they are exposed to and they come to a restaurant or eating areas.  So for the XXX   I mean, I am - I agree with that.  Because even for smokers it means that if they can smoke XXX   unhealthy, so we can do something else.
