 Uh.
 Uh. My good memory of the restaurant is the --- one is in the FUSHIMI INARI   and there is a just one chef and there is no other staff but the --- there they make their sandwiches and soup and dessert, they are very delicious and he was before umm worked at the hotel.
 Umm. And also his umm his umm attitude for the customer is very good.
 His --- the --- first principle is to enjoy the meal for them in the cheap price, so he made a lot --- lots of effort to give the good service.
 Umm. I like the best is umm Chinese style.
 Because in that restaurant, I can enjoy the --- lot of kinds of the Chinese food, so I like that.
 Hmm.
 Umm. One more time please.
 Umm. I don't agree with that because some people --- I think everyone need   to enjoy the eating so --- and for some people they can't --- maybe they can't enjoy the eating without smoking, so they umm eat --- they eat --- don't need to abandon --- they just make the separate seat.
