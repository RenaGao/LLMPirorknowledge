My enjoyable experience.  Well, when eating with my family for example well, just - just being there, eating and well, being among them is really enjoyable to me.  So every time we  sit in a  restaurant it's always fun for me.
In terms of food?
Well, ah, actually from - when I was from - when I was little up until now mostly of my life I have been - I have been exposed with anime.  So I'm pretty more into the Japanese.  I love the Japanese culture.  So - so most of the restaurant I use is Japanese theme, Japanese theme restaurant.
Mostly
Mostly because of their food.  Ah, you see Japanese restaurant their main dish is rice, mostly based on rice.  So we in Malaysia also eat rice on a daily basis.  So I don't really eat western food.  I don't really prefer that.
Ah, yes.
Because I don't remember because I'm not really a smoker, so I don't really get the  perception  of a smoker if they cannot smoke.  So I think if they want to - rather than ban completely maybe like I said, ah, prepare special area for smoker to smoke for a while and then get back to their meals later.
