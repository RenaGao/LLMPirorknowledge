Ah-hmm at any restaurant.
It was during XXX   this year and then like most people went back to their hometown, but we didn't at that time because of some reason and then, ah, we, ah, like - and then we went to the AEON Mall and then so we went to the secret recipe restaurant.  So, we ate I mean like the XXX   thing I guess because my sister treat the whole family.
Hmm, for me I like the Japanese restaurant.
I like their - their rice.  It's sticky like the - our rice is, hmm, it's different from the - the Japanese what they call their rice.
Glutinous rice.
Yeah, I guess.  But apart from that I still love the - okay, first would be the Malaysian - sorry, the Malaysia and then the second if I have to choose from many then I will choose the Japanese.
I like Japanese.
The service like in the restaurant.  
I think it's all the same.
Should we ban in restaurants.
Okay.  I think I disagree with the smoking has to be banned in restaurants because when like some people whose their health condition is not very good and then like when they breath smoke and all that what they term secondary smoker I guess, it's very, it's more like dangerous than the smoker himself or herself.  So, I think I really agree with that.  So, for like for that law to be enforce I guess maybe they can put like one section for the smokers to go and smoke rather than they have to go 2 to 3 meters from - distance for the - to smoke.  So, why not they just put like one section for the smokers to smoke.  So, I guess that it wouldn't disturb the environment of the restaurant.
