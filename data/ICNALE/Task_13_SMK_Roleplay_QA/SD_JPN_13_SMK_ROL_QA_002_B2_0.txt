Okay.  So, one of the my good memories for eating at the restaurant is that - the time I went to - when I went to restaurant with my friend.  At that time, my friend - at that time, it was my birthday---
So, my friends congratulating me.  And also at that time it was long time no see to my friends because now I go - now I go outside my hometown.  So, I - I was - we have - we had a lot of - a lot of enjoyable time, nice time too and share my memories or my good things or recent things.
Yeah.
Yeah, free birthday cake.
Um, I think Japanese restaurant.
I like Japanese food.  I think it is so healthy and enjoy a lot of kind of food and also I went - I have some experience to go abroad, so at that time I really wanted to eat Japanese.
I think I - it is depends on the case but personally I don't like the smoking; so if possible, the non-smokers area should be created.  But I think they are also some people they want - who want to enjoy smoking, so I think it is impossible for - for them.
