Hmm, restaurant, um, uh, uh.
Good, good experience?
Um, well, uh okay.  Uh, so back in China, uh, last summer, when I go to - when I went a Hotspot restaurant, then it's a really famous Hotspot, uh, restaurant for its service, and when, uh, you can see that I have long hair, and when I eat the hotspot, it's really getting sweaty and I - I just - I didn't even thought to get something to hold my hair and the waiter came around and gave me a - a rubber to just for me to hold my hair and then was also at that day I wear long sleeves, and it's all white, and - and the waiter saw that and come to give me a, uh, um, a plastic.  I - I don't know how to explain that, uh, plastic sleeves to cover my this area.  And while I didn't even ask and he bought it to me, so it's really - well, it's really a good experience at the restaurant.
Do I like the best?  Um, as if for service, I like the, uh, Japanese restaurant, but, uh, cook, I like Chinese.  I like - I - I really like Chinese food.  So, as it for the food, I prefer the Chinese restaurant.
Yeah.
Uh, we have to explain, uh, uh, uh, experience a lot of failure to to find the real Chinese restaurant.  And also, uh, you can trust your friends, your also Chinese friends.  They recommend you some Chinese restaurant.  Um, basically, um, they're all good.
Yeah, but if you, uh, you running in the, uh, street and you saw a Chinese restaurant, and let's try it, also, well, mostly it's not good.
Um, I think it's bad to smoke and not, uh, of for the smoker and also for the people around, but it's really, I - I understand it's really difficult to quit, um, and also eating can be a - can take a long time.  You - you cannot take it - uh, you cannot take it that long time to not smoke.  But I - I can - there are all restaurants now, they have smoking room.  I think it's better than just you can smoke in the restaurant, just all free, I think, the smoking room is really good.
