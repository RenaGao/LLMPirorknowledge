Okay, the - the restaurant attendants, they are super attendant and they don't even waste time in giving you whatever you demand for, whatever you want.  And even without your asking, they already try to figure it out what you are about to ask or what you are about - know you, demanding from them.  So they quickly give you the service and their service is very fast and very convenient and they welcome everybody with smile and - which is very pleasant.  I think most people will like - will like that restaurant and I will introduce my friends to that restaurant as well.
The - the best that has the most super service and most delicious food because there are some restaurants that will have super service and non-delicious food, others who have very super delicious food and the service could be very poor.  So what I have to do is I just have to make some choices like each time I need this - I need the good service, I should go to the best service restaurant.  Each - each time I need delicious food, I should go to the delicious food restaurant.  So because there is no way I could change the restaurant or switch.
I agree sir.
Yeah, because the number of sick people that comes to the restaurant to eat and these are nonsmoking people, they are more than the number of people that smoke.
