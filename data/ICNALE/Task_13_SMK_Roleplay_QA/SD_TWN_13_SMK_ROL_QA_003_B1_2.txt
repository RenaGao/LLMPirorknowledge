Uh, good experience at a restaurant, I think is that, hmm, some - there is a restaurant near - near here - near NTU and one time me and my friends went to the restaurant.  A clerk there saw us and said that she noticed that we came to the restaurant many times and she gave us some drinks that's for free.
But actually, we didn't go to that restaurant before.
So, I think that it is just a way for promotion  
And let us go into the restaurant.
But I felt happy.
I think I like Japanese restaurant best, because I like to eat fishes very much.
All kind of fishes and also - but also I don't like to eat spicy food, so like in some - some - like some Italian restaurants, they add much spices on it and also in Chinese restaurant, sometimes it's - it's very spicy.
I think in Taiwan, smoking should be banned in all the restaurants--- 
---because - because most of the Taiwanese can't endure smoking.  Well, because of policy, it also has been acted for a long time.
However, in other countries I think it can't be totally banned, because such as Japanese, there is no policy like this in Taiwan.  So, hmm, in Japan I think that in some place, there should be some restaurant that it can smoke and some can't.  Well, if you like smoking, you can go to the restaurant that allows smoking.  If you don't, then you can go to the restaurant that does not - does not allow.
