Very delicious food.  Okay, but there - there was - that's not the - there was - okay, should it be a restaurant I mean.
It has to be a restaurant.  Okay.  I think I think I think there is this one okay.

Well, smoking like brings you know negatives - negative things like not - not to just the - to the person who smoked but also the environment, also the people around him or her and I think I strongly think that it should be prohibited like uh, you know, people should have the common sense not to smoke in public.  I mean, you know, like they - they have to like think about others, think about their health and - and not just about him or herself.
