Probably yeah.
Uh, I can remember one restaurant that I have been in United States.
The name Peter Luger.
That res - restaurant is also well known for, uh, very delicious steak and Michelin star, uh, restaurant.
So, it's quite expensive.
But the services that they offered to me and all the customers very perfect---.
So I was the person who, uh, kind of don't like to - to give a tip.
Because it's not familiar with our Korean culture.
But I was very happy to give them a tip.
Uh, I'm very, uh, rice-prefer person.
So, I always prefer rice than bread or a sandwich or like western style food.
So - and yeah, so I like rice, so I kind of like all kind of rice like Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
Right.
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
Because, uh, uh, I'm not - I'm a non-smoker.
And smoking in the, uh, restaurant, basically a non-smoker could, uh, invade the non-smoker's right to enjoy their, uh, services in the restaurant.
So, yeah, that - all the restaurants supposed to make, uh, some specific place for smoking area or smoke persons to smoke, yeah. 
Thank you.
Okay.
