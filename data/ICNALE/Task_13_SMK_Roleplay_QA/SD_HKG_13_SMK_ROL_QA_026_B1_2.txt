Uh, I have once go to a restaurant which is The Steakhouse that I work in there because I took a girl to there for a dinner that I was - I - in someday I want, maybe we can - maybe, uh, she and I can become a couple in the future, so I.  And I know that it was, uh, her birth - her birthday was coming so I just took her to - to - to The Steakhouse and the environment was fantastic that almost, uh, imagine that he - uh, he help me to hold almost half of the venue that has nobody but just, uh, she and I.  And, we really have good dinner on that day that we talk - we talk so many things that I know and we - we knew each other better than before and it was a - a wonderful experience.
You mean the - the style of food that Chinese---
---Japanese?  Um, I prefer the Japanese food because - and - and my family and - and I really like eating sushi and sasami that - that in Japanese restaurant they - normally they - they will have a very good customer service that - and we can feel comfortable in there and also - and the food there's the - the sushi - the sushi meal will - they are making so I prefer Japanese food.
In whole restaurant.
And, in - I totally agree that the restaurant should be completely forbid for smoking because that - and there are - there are two types - two types of people who smoking and they are not prefer the smoking to smoke.  And although the people who smoke they have the right to smoke, but they should not, uh - they should not affect or harm the right that the people who don't smoke, prefer they want to breathe clear air.  So - and there are some smoking area for the smokers who they can totally enjoy smoking in this area and they should not harm the right for the others who don't prefer smoking that they want to show - they just want to have like clear air to breathe so yes in the restaurant there should - they should totally ban smoking in there.
