Okay.
Okay.  I have to think.
Okay.  So, that was a little restaurant---
And we have - we can have um traditional food there.
It's pretty noisy---
 ---but the meal come very quickly.
We don't have to wait too long to enjoy the meal.
That restaurant also have a non-smoking area so we can choose whether we want to go to having meal in which area and so we don't distract with um the - okay.  So...
Yes, yes, that's what I mean.
I think it's affordable.
I like Indonesian food.
Yes.
I disagree with that.
Even the smoker have their umm, their right to smoke.
As long as they don't disturb nonsmoker people.
I think by dividing the area---
---nonsmoker area and smoker area, it is enough because the customer can choose whether they want to sit in the smoker - smoking area or in the non-smoking area.
