 Okay.
 Uh, when I went to a restaurant with my family, uh, sea food restaurant, uh, we had a lot of sushi.
 And we --- we ate a lot of sushi and then when I --- when we was   about to go home, the restaurant owner came to us and gave me some desserts.
 No free --- free.
 So, it was surprising.
 Yeah --- no.
 Yes, I heard the owner was feeling good.  
 I like umm Japanese restaurants the best---  
 Because they're most delicious.
 Umm, I agree with the idea because when the smoking area is separated some smokes come to nonsmokers' area, so.
 Yes.
 So, smoking is completely prohibited.
 Uh, yes, I can understand the idea.
 Then, I suggest that uh this restaurant uh creates smoking shop and non-smoking shop.
 Then, the smokers can enjoy.
