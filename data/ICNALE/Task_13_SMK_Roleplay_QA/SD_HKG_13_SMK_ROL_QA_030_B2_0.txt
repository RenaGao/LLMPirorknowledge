Yes.
Um, I think which I really remember it is one time I go to the Harbour City to have a lunch with my cousin and her daughter - uh, not - her son.  Um, I like it because I seldom go to a restaurant which have really good view, uh, we can see the Victoria Harbour and then enjoy the brunch.  And, yes, I like enjoying a meal with a good view and maybe some music to let me relax and have a good meal.
Uh-hmm.
Definitely the Japanese food.
Um, first of all, I think it is quite healthy because like the sushi and also some maybe rice or something related to vegetable which they usually, um, have not so salty and which is quite fresh.  And I hate the strong, um, flavor, like the one in - like Cantonese food or Thai food.  Yeah, I like the simpler one.
Um, I don't - I don't agree with it because I think there are still some people think that they can check XXX   to smoke so they can enjoy their smoking.  Uh, we cannot stop them, so I think that restaurant can make some outdoor area for them to smoke, but not in the indoor.  I think it is - should be - it should be totally banned in all indoor area, but okay for outdoor.
