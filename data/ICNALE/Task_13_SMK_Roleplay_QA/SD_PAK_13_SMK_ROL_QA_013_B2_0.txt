Uh, restaurants, I often go to restaurants, but whenever, uh, I go with my friends, with family, I often pay visit to restaurants.  But then I'm with my friends, I really enjoyed the company of my friends.  We have a chilly gathering.  We enjoy, we get amused by the atmosphere and that is the place where you can - uh, you know, you know like express your ideas openly.
Chinese restaurant.
As the food, the culture-specific food of China are eminent, they are well reputed throughout the world, so - and I have taste for it as well.
Yeah, I - I agree.
Public not only in restaurants - restaurants, but everywhere, in every XXX . 
Because people get irritated.  There are people who do not like being part of the atmosphere where cigarettes are being smoked.
