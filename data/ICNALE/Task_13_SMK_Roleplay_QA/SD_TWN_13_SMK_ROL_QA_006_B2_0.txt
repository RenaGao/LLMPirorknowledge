I think the Japanese is my favorite one, because many, many Japanese restaurant is there, it's not that greasy and after eating them, I will feel healthy.  I like to go to Japanese restaurant.
I disagree with it, because some restaurants can prohibit smoking if they don't like people smoking.  But some restaurants can still let people smoke there, because if you don't like, then you just don't come here.  You can smoke, but just don't smoke in the restaurant that prohibits smoking.
