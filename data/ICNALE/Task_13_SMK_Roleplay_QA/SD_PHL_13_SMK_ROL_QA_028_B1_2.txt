I think one of the best restaurants that I've been is with my - with my high school friend.
Umm, it is a buffet restaurant wherein you just go and eat whatever and ha-ha - whatever you want and there's no limit about what you're going to take.
For being the most authentic one or - or the control one I think, I found I like the Chinese restaurant the most for the reason they have a trivial taste when you eat it and every meal that they serve it has a vegetable on it.
I umm - I - I agree that it should be banned.
Because, it is not only that here that they're just trying but also they have   the others that's why second-hand smoke is more dangerous than - then the first-hand smoke, the one who is smoking.
