Hmm good.  I think the main concept of a good experience in eating is when you are eating with the people you love.  So the good experience I have is when we had an out-outing when I was young and because we barely do that now because of work.  And we used to go to restaurants just to eat as a family and that's what I really like.
Hmm.
Which I like the best?  Perhaps the native restaurants, the Filipino restaurants, perhaps, Philippine restaurants because they I tend to I really I am really not in favor of our culture, but in doing so, in exploring the way, we present dishes I tend to realize that ah our country have not bad.
I agree because smoking only gives ah self self satisfaction and not for others and this is not really this does not smoking does not really give any benefit at all for your health.  Some people say it's a stress reliever but I dec I highly decline because there are lot of ways for you to release stress rather than smoking.  I highly agree to ban smoking in our country.
