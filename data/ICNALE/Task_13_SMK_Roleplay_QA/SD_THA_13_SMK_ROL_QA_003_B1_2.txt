Um, like?
Or just---
Uh, there are the different when - when I go with my friend and go with my family.
For my friend we - we - let me spend some time to take a - uh, further XXX   and then we talk and we - we - we talk, we share many thing together.
And - and---
But we - family, um, sometime if - if I go with the big family, it feel nervous and don't - don't eat too much.
But if only my family or something it feel more comfortable.
Uh, for me, I like, uh, Japanese restaurant.
I like salmon and sushi.
Um, uh, I - I think we should have the smoking area for - in the restaurant but if the restaurant don't have the smoking area, it's - it's - it's good---
---it's the - yeah, it's better.
It's better, but, uh, some kind of restaurant maybe the customer like to smoking or something, so it is better to have the smoking area but some - some kind of restaurant that, um - I think they shouldn't have it.
Yeah---
---it's - it's depend - it's depend on type of restaurant about the customer.
