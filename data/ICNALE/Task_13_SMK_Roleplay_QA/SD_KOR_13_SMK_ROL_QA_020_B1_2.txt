Mmm, one thing, I went with my family - go to Korean barbecue.
In that, actually my father was cooking.
And I and my older brother---
---play - playing a game.
And my mother is cooking - hel - help my father.
And then, my father said, hey guys, it's time.
And I and my old brother running and kick ball.
Now I think I was little rude to my father - to my father.
But I think that is my interesting memory.
I like Chinese.
Because one of my favorite food is noodle.
And Schezwan noodles is my favorite.
Actually, I ate Schezwan noodle many - very many times but I like also XXX .
Uh, 1 week, 1 day.
But when - when I - when many, 1 week, 5 days.
Yeah.
I really like it.
Yeah, alright.
Yeah, hmm.
I agree.
Because actually, I hate smoking.
So, hmm, I think smoking people think one more time to non-smoking people---
---because smoking people is not - not bothering when non-smoking - non-smoking.
But non-smoking now smoking, they feel very bad, very angry.
