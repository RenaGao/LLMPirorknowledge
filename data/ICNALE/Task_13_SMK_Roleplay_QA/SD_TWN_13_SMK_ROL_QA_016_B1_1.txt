Um, uh, last February---
---and my family and I went to a - one Thailand food---
Thailand food.
Thai food---
---restaurant.
And it is my first time to taste Thai food.
Um, and a lot of - and - and my spirit is good---
---but I think I don't like the food at all.
Because I had a stomach ache after went to a restaurant.
But I like - but I think the atmosphere in that restaurant let me, uh, want to went twice.
I like the Korean food the best.
Because I like to eat spicy food.
No.
I disagree--- 
---for I think it is everyone's freedom to - to smoke.
But they - they can infuse others.
So, if - if we don't want to smell the smoke---
---we can choose a - hotel-based smoking restaurant.
