Okay so may I was with family and we ate at this restaurant called Yakimix.  It was a buffet restaurant and it was my sister's birthday, so we spent our lunch time there.  And it was a really good restaurant.  It was very clean, the food was so nice, the ambience was so nice.  And everything was unlimited.  So I really enjoyed it.
Japanese restaurants.
Umm it's I prefer I prefer Japanese restaurants because it's where me and my family eat the most.    And I really like the the chefs.
I agree.
Because it's not right that while people while people are having a nice time during their meal, they could smell cigarette.  I think it's not eh just the fact that it's not healthy for people.  It's also not a good manner that you smoke in front of the people.
