Well, I did not try them all.  Uh, for me I think the Chinese food is the best.  Normally there I - well - I, well, not because I cannot stand for, uh, stand other kinds of food, but I really prefer to eat Chinese food.
Hmm, maybe, depends on which restaurant you go to.  Well, some restaurants, they may normally running - may not be run by some Chinese.  Well, they may be - they may be run by some people from other countries.  They only copy the menu from the Chinese restaurants. Well, for some restaurants maybe, um, in the north and the most people come to Japan actually came from the North East - North Eastern part of the, uh, of China, and they are really experts in cooking and then also making some other stuff that you can take away, well, for your after meal enjoy - uh, you can enjoy the meal after.  Um, also some collections about the seafood, yeah, some other types of things, yeah.
Well, maybe, um, uh same for the cigarette people, it is quite not realistic to banned all the - all the - uh, all the smoking behavior, and, however, in the restaurant, you can set up a - uh, a cubit allowing to - that allows people to smoke there.  Well, of course, it would be better if they set a fan there and then after you - uh after you smoke and go out of this cubit, well, you will not smoke like cigarettes all around you, and then, you will not affect the child or women, any people that do not smoke with that smoke.
