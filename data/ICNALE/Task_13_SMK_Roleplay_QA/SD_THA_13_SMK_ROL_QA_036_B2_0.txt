Um, uh, um, a month ago, I went to have dinner at one restaurant but I cannot remember the name, but in - in Chonburi province.  Uh, the - the atmosphere there is peaceful and it's situated on, um, the sea, I would say.  And there was a lot of healthy food for - how can I say, uh, other people, for people at different age.  Yeah, that's it.
Um, I will say I like Thai restaurant the most because I am familiar with the food so that - I feel like I don't - I do not have to force myself to eat what I am not unfamiliar to.
Um, uh, yes I do agree because I cannot find what you will get from the smell of cigarette unless disease.
