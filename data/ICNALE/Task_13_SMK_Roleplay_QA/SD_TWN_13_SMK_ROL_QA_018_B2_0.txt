I like Korean the best because, um, I think Korean food is really delicious because they are little spicy, and I love kimchi.
Yes.  Um, I agree with it because, um, I don't like the smell of a smoke.  So, I think a restaurant is a public - public area.  So, you should consider that.  Some people didn't like smoke.
