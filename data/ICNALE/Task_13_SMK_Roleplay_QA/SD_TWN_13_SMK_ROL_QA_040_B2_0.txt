Um, well - well last week I went to a Japanese restaurant.  They had the - they had a lot of delicacies, and the - the - the ambience was nice there, their service was great, their food was awesome.
Yeah.
I think I like, uh, all of them.
Except, uh, American restaurant.
Because - because normally we - uh, I - I like soup.
And American restaurant have burgers, fries and - and salads, and that's not my type.
Yeah, normally they don't have a soup.
For some they only have a ca - corn soup and that's only one.
Uh, I disagree because I think peoples - uh, uh, I think, uh, like I said I think smokers have the right to smoke as there is no reg - government regulations to - to be - to forbid this.
Yes.
