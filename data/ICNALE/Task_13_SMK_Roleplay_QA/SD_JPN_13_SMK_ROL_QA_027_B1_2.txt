 Yes.
 Good experience?
  . Uh.
 Good memory.
 Uh. Uh. Okay. Uh.
 When I was a maybe elementary school children, uh, I went to a restaurant with my parents and sister.
 And it was my --- my birthday and the --- my --- my parents uh ordered a cake and then my parents and sister uh con --- con --- congratulate me and then other people near my seat also congratulated me.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Uh. Japanese restaurant.
 Uh. I --- I simply like Japanese foods.
 Yeah.
 No.
 Because if --- I don't know the smoker's feeling, but the smoker want to smoke, but uh if he --- if the restaurant completely uh prohibits smoking, the smoker can't --- can't come to the restaurant, and the restaurants also can't earn money.
 So, if the restaurant uh separates the smoker and nonsmoker --- smoker it's not a problem I think.
