Good memory, hmm.  When - when I went to my - my restaurant, working - working part-time job, then my mother - with my mother and mother's friend and her daughter and me went to my restaurant.   My mother's friend, it is near the birthday of my mother's friend, so I - so my restaurant staffs know - know about her birthday from me and they - they celebrated her birthday with music and dessert.
Hmm, I like Italian.
No.
American.
It is because I like hamburger.
Mmmm, I disagree with that idea.
Because I understand it is not good for health, but it is - if the area of smoking is located in restaurants separately.
It is - it is good.
