Uh-huh, yeah.
Umm, ah, one of my - a nice experience I had once was when I was in Spain.  Uh, I had a girlfriend at the time and I was actually in her hometown and we were in this small courtyard, umm by ourselves and this restaurant had this extremely nice bread and some kind of tomato sauce on it as well.  It was kind of like a pizza, but it didn't have cheese, umm, and olive oil too.  And it was - it was extremely nice and tasty.  Bread was fresh.  It was really nice sunny day, umm, yeah that was one of my memorable restaurant times.
Umm, ah, I quite like - I don't really eat Chinese food so much.  I quite like Japanese restaurants, uh, mainly sushi I think.
Umm, well I - I don't eat meat, umm, so I can't really eat much Ramen or Chinese food and I find sushi really, really tasty, very fresh, cold.  Fresh sushi - sushi was really, really nice.
I agree.
Uh, well, as I said earlier, smoking affects other people other than yourself, so it's basically a very selfish way of getting your fix by harming other people.  Just last week I was in a Korean restaurant and I saw, uh, a young child, must have been about 4 years old come in with what looks like her grandma.  They sat together next to each other and the grandma started to smoke.  I almost went over and told her to stop it, but I feel that would be kind of intruding.  But it's - it should definitely be banned.
Yeah, in public places.  The child didn't have a choice, yet the grandma was giving that child smoke and that's very - that's basically offensive.  You could say that is offensive and this country is a little bit slow really I think to getting the law.  You know in - in England obviously we already have it where you can't smoke inside anywhere and it should be like that.
