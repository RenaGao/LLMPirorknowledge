Good experience in a restaurant.  Um, I like eating in the Hong Kong Star restaurant because it's like, uh - uh, very traditional things and like representing Hong Kong.  And then I think like in the Western Countries you won't have the waitress or the chef that work that fast and then it's really special, um, to have a taste of it, so maybe when my friends come to Hong Kong, I will bring them there to try this also.
Um, I will love the Western restaurant - restaurant because I love eating burger and - I don't know - I don't like eating rice, I prefer spaghetti, pasta or something.
Um, I think maybe not, um, all prohibited because some people they have the needs of like smoking and they want to talk with their friends for like a long time.  So, I think it's important for the restaurant to set up a prohibit, um, smoking area in the restaurant but not - they don't have the need to, um, prohibit like all area or something.
