Uh, maybe, Fairwood.
Uh, because, uh, I always go to, uh, Fairwood to have my dinner and service there was quite good because those waitress will, uh, will help you to take your food to your desk - to your table and so that you don't need to wait outside.
Yeah.
Um, I love eating Japanese food like sushi because, uh, the - the sushi is - the rice is quite, um, soft and I can eat the salmon and the salmon is quite sweet, uh, when it is not cooked.  And there is als - there are also many ways to cook, uh, Japanese food.  They have different method to cook the same - same ingredient and I - so I think I love Japanese food.
Um, yes, I - I agree with banning, uh, smoking in all Hong Kong restaurant.  Because, um, in a restaurant people go there to have their meal and they just want to have meal in a comfortable, uh, eh, environment.  And some people may not be able to bear those, uh, smell from - of the cigarette and - and so I quite agree with the ban.
