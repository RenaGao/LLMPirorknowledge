Um, maybe, a Japanese restaurant where it's in Hong Kong Island and I think although the size of this restaurant is quite small but I think, um, the ambient of this restaurant is good because you can, um, interact with the staff or even a chef and even you don't know how - what is the Japanese food and they teach you like when you eat sushi, they will teach you to, um, some proper, um, manner.  And then they will teach you to say, oh, this sauce is perfectly fine for this sushi.  And, the other sushi is perfect for the other sauce.  And then, um, we had a good experience in that restaurant and then they will also introduce some, um, wine to my parents so that my parents can taste, um, the Japanese wine.  And then, even though we don't have a meal at - in that restaurant and we can call the chef to our apartment and cook for us.
Uh, I guess, uh, Italian restaurants because I like pizza, I like spaghetti or like, um, Italian food so I quite - um, so I love Italian restaurant.  And then for the others, um, yes, I also like but, um, I am more likely to go to the, uh, Italian restaurant if I have a choice.
Um, absolutely agree with, um, this because, um, like the smell of the cigarette is quite unpleasant and when you have a meal and you cannot enjoy at all because, um, the smell, um, destroy, um, the meal - the smell from a meal and then you find, um - you will cough even eq - uh, frequently because the smell is quite unpleasant for you and you don't XXX  .  And then, you - it's hard for you to enjoy the atmosphere in the restaurant because, um, this - uh, lots - if there are lots of smoker in the restaurant and you - because you don't want to stay in a environment which is full of a cigarette - the smell of cigarette is make you sick.  So, I think, um, it is good for all restaurant that, um, forbid smoking.
