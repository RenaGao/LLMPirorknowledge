Yes.
Umm, last week, I went to - went to a restaurant in Namba with my friend, Shaun.  He's from China, and it was lunch - lunch, and it was basically all-you-can-eat salad and drink, all-you-can-drink at the drink bar. And yeah, we had a great time talking and eating delicious - and I think I had curry.  He had a big salad.
No.
Because - umm, the atmosphere was very nice.  It was a beautiful day.  The sun was shining through the windows.  The staff was very friendly.  The food came out very fast considering how busy the restaurant was, and just the all-you-can-eat, all-you-can-drink aspect of it.
Drink?  
No.
It was lunchtime.
Right.
Umm, I enjoy Italian restaurants.
Umm, because I enjoy pasta, pizza, and actually to be honest one of the reasons is if - if you are in a more rural area, as you know one of the big difficulties for foreigners living here, especially English-speaking foreigners, is reading kanji.  Often if you go to a Japanese restaurant, sometimes they don't have an English menu, and it's very difficult to know what you are ordering.  However, if you go to, for example, an Italian restaurant, often - even if the menu is in Japanese, it will be written in katakana, and the - the words will be, for example, carbonara and then the same, so we know exactly what we are ordering.  It makes us feel a little bit more comfortable.
In Japan?
Uh, I agree but it should be phased in, not just suddenly enforced because I think there is a very, very large smoking population in Japan, and just because in my country, New Zealand, they had basically done a similar thing, smoking has been very looked down upon by the government and by society, it's become very expensive.  There's no smoking areas in restaurants, and I - so I think it works.  Uh, however, in Japan it may face a lot of difficulties because of the number of people who smoke.  But I think it should be phased in over - over a long period of time I think.
