Good experience.
Good experience in the restaurant, uh, last year, I went to buffet, which is a premium buffet and the atmosphere there when - when I go there, they - it's not very bad.  It's like - it's quiet because when I go there, they - they - they just opened, so we like - we think the atmosphere of the restaurant is so quiet that it's a little awkward.  So, when we get the food we ordered in the buffet, um, the owner they come to us and ask us, how was the food, how is it, how the restaurant, so I think they have - they care for us, they care - and they - he - he - he didn't just come one time, he come like three times but he - it feels like he not - like bother us.  It's very friendly.  He is so friendly like a friend like we - eating in our home - our own home and my like uncle come to talk with me like how was the food, is that good, if you - uh, if you want anything more, so you can ask me.
I like Japanese restaurant.
Uh, they have cozy atmosphere, it's like - it's not like Chinese restaurant.  It's like so loud, many XXX   of things like taste XXX   but in Japanese restaurant, I like Japanese food first and the highly - hygienic - hygienic restaurant is my type, yeah.
I think disagree, because smoking is some kind of - type of relax for someone who gets stressed.  So, nonsmoking area should be provided in some restaurants, maybe a small room or the just - even the restaurant in half and when separate the nonsmoking and smoking area in the restaurants.
