Hmm.  Umm what time you are able to eat outside and that was in the mall, Mall of Asia, and the the food was great but that is not the the essence of I think going out.

Actually, I am not very particular with with anything XXX  eating in restaurant.  I think it is a good idea to try different kind of restaurant to to experience or to have something to learn to the different kind of cuisines of different country.
Yes, because in a restaurant the reason why you go there is to eat and enjoy and then enjoy your meal.  And it's not a good thing while eating to you know smell something like smoke coming from cigarette.  So it is really important to ban smoking inside the restaurant.
