Uh, back to the holiday.
I think it's the Christmas holiday.
I think I went to the restaurant with my family, with my grandmother, with my father and mother and also my brother to the restaurant and we got the - the, what we call, a high-quality food but with the low price.
Yes, with low prices
It's actually a big restaurant and also well-known of Indonesia.
Very famous.
For me, I do prefer Indonesian one  ---.
Since it provides us with the Indonesia food.  But for the second place I do like Japanese restaurant since I do interested with their culture, their food.  Thus I want to know more about yeah at least their food.
Honestly, I strongly agree with that situation because by smoking in the - let's say public place where the others not also smoke, then it will actually harm the others.  The solution will be they have to be in the like - what we call it, in the different places from the others thus they could smoke up there.  Or the other solution will be they have to, let's say, inhale the smoke.  It won't harm the others.
Oh yeah, yeah.
