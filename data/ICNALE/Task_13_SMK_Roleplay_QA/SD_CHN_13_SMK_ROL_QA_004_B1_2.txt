Uh---
Just a few months ago, my birthday, my friend and I was - was facing the - going to a - going to some - going for job or going to - going to study.
And it's not - our future is not very clear so we get together and have a meal to get - to talk with each other just like what will, I think you may do, what is - what is more better than you do not think - you do what, so and that meal we drinked a lot and eat  a lot, just because maybe the food is not very good but my friends - friends are all together and that makes me very happy.
Japanese.
Because I am now in Japan and Japanese food is the most traditional.
And don't - such as Chinese food is not what it taste in China.
Um, it's very, very different.  I can - I can hardly describe it but when tasted it, I can suddenly feel that this is - this is Japanese Chinese food.
No, I do not agree with this.
Because smoking is not - it's legal, it's not illegal and it - it has - it's a bit - it's a - it can be used on not on - not in all the unlimited areas because - and maybe some people without smoking, they cannot fix on themselves and when they want to discuss - have a seriously discussion in some restaurant, without smoking maybe they cannot do a very good conclude - get a not very good conclusion which may - maybe get more serious, um, get - get what - and which may lead to a serious future.  This is very bad, I think.  Everyone has his ability to call some - call for himself and smoking is not - is limited in the room just open areas it should be - only should be limited, I think that.
