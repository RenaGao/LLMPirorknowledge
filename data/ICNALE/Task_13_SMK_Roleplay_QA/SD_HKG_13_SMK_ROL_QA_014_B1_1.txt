Yeah.
Uh-hmm.
Uh-hmm.
Uh, we usually go to that place in a Kwun Tong, there is a mall where there is a Chinese restaurant who make good Peking duck, so we went there a lot.
Uh, when we walk in it's a Chinese, uh, decoration with all the, uh, I don't know, I guess, the table - wood table and then wood desk, also, uh, the wood chair and then they have like a circling table and then we just start ordering like, uh, they have free traditional one and they've new mix cuisine, I guess, you can call it.  So like Peking duck and there is - usually all the vegetable with - and fish because my grandparents are - they don't chew that much and they don't chilly so we just order some plain vegetable and fish, I think they enjoyed it a lot.
Uh-hmm.
Uh, probably Japanese.
Because they usually have a way of preparing food that is, um, very responsibility so they - they don't use a lot of oil and spices and like overdo things.  They make it really simple and then you can just taste what the food originally taste like.
I agree smoking should be banned.
Because smoking is addictive and things that are addictive is not good to the society.
Okay.
