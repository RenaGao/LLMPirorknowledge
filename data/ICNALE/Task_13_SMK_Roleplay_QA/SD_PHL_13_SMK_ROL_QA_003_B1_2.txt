Uhm, well, there is this place that uh, really - that is really special to me since uh, I have been there with my family.  We - we have been uh, complete at that time and we ate some soup and uh, that soup is really a specialty in that place.  The place is really uh, cold, there is a good drive in there.  Yeah, that's my favorite place.
I really love the Pilipino cuisine which is---  
Because I don't know maybe uh, we have been really uh, into that ever since because it really catches the - our taste buds, right and uh, maybe second is the Japanese cuisine, because I really like tempura, ramen, yeah.
Uh, uh, well, I think restaurants should have their own policies regarding this one and they have the freedom to decide regarding they should ban the smokers in their area because it's their personal property.  Well, I think it should just be banned on public places, but not in the private places like the restaurants.
