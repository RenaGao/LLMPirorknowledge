Hmm.
  As I mentioned before I really - I don't like kids, eh, because I think really an - annoying - annoying of when they are crying.  And I remembered one, eh, last time I go outside with - I went outside with my family.  There's other families sit - eh, sat next to us and the babies cry - was crying a lot and I felt really angry.
Good experience, um, hmm, good experience maybe go, uh, I like some good service of some restaurant and maybe I go to China, eh, Shenzhen with my friend and the many restaurant in there, the service of the staff are really good and I think it is a good experience.
I like Japanese.
Uh, not Japanese - it's good, it's - I don't like the others because I, eh, I - I can't eat spicy food and Korean food or Thai food or maybe Indian food, the famous - famous dishes of this country - of those country is spicy.  Therefore, I choose Japanese.
Hmm, I disagree with that because I think smoking is your own choice.  In some restaurant you can maybe, eh, set a place - place for the people who are - who need to smoke and separate with, eh, some customer who are not smoking and I accept people smoking therefore I disagree that need to stop this - stop everyone smoke.
