Umm, yes.
Well, just last week it's my brother's birthday and so we ate a Japanese restaurant.
I like Japanese food the best because sushi - yeah.
Yeah.
I agree, because as what I said earlier, smoking is really bad especially if it's a second-hand smoke.  So people are not really comfortable with other people smoking but they just can't say anything about it.  So I think if it's spread - if it's banned throughout all the restaurants, it will help - maintain you know, a common ground that people don't want to smoke.   
That people does - doesn't want to smoke.
