Well mostly, the good experience there is the food.  Well, when the food tasted like ah, there is no other restaurant in the city, you always come back.
I, I like the best, the Japanese food, because ah, Japanese cuisine has a very unique taste.  I think it's the trend now for most, most Filipinos.
I think ah, it should be, the smoking should be banned in any, any place in the Philippines now, because ah, because as of today ah, people are wanting a clear air, clear environment and a lot of diseases like asthma and some, and lung, lung cancer are now existing these days.
