Oh, thank you.
Okay.
Um.
I have to say that I have - I said I have chances to go to restaurant with my parent, and because they are busy of course.  Um, actually I don't like the atmosphere at the restaurant.
Uh, I don't like to, uh - I like to stay at home and have dinner with my mother because both of us can feel relaxed.  When we are in - at a restaurant we have to take care of our appearance, our poses or something.
Yes.
Uh, Japanese restaurant.
I like sashimi actually.
Yeah.
I agree like I said, uh, it's bad for a non-smoker to smoke the secondhand smoke - to have the secondhand smoke, yes.  So, I think the law should protect the one who don't smoke.
