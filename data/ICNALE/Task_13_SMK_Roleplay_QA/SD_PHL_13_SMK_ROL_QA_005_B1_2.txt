Oh there is one time the - me and my friends ate at a restaurant that offers a good meal.  There is one time the - we just forget how much it will cost us or how long it would take us just to go there because the meal - their meal is really that good.  It was very good.
I think I would go with the restaurants that has good service, good  
Actually I cannot agree nor disagree, but I think there should be a good separation between the customers because it is really unavoidable that there will be smokers and if I would be the owner, I would also value my non-smoker customers as well.  So I think putting them like two areas of my restaurant would be very helpful because my target market will be same, I have no biases against customers, that's something I don't want or other customers to accept one.  At least I could accommodate both of them, the smokers and non-smokers.
