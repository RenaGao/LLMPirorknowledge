Okay.
Uh, we go - uh, me and my friend go to a restaurant, pizza restaurant and we had a surprise party for me last year.  So, that's how to - we manage the party and the birthday like that at there.  I really, really happy about it.
Uh, we need to order the food.
Uh-huh.
Uh I like to eat at Indonesian restaurant mostly.
Because it's cheap.
And with the food it's so much so much option there.  Then a Chinese restaurant, I don't think I ever go to Chinese restaurant before.  So, yeah, I don't have go there, so I don't have any experiences there.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Uh, pardon, pardon. I don't get it.
For me personally, I agree because I cannot stand with the smoke too.  So, I really, really hate it when a person try become a smoking in front of me or near me because I have an asthma like that.
Okay.
