Restaurant.

Yeah, it's - it's very expensive and I think - but I do think it's worth it.
Yeah, I've - I've tried it.
Uh, cooked - the cooker has just cooked the Kobe beef in front of you and you can show how fresh of the - how fresh is - uh, was the beef and just let it enter your mouth.  You can - you can feel it melt in your mouth. .

Yeah, Chinese food.
Yeah, I guess, uh, since the - the people they open the restaurant in Japan will change the menu like it's not the real traditional Chinese food, but I think they can still - they - they still keep some real things.

Hmm.
Actually, I don't think so.
I would say, since people like, uh, drinking and smoking and it's very, very cool for - for them to - to come together and eat together - eat together.  I think it would - if all the restaurants ban that, that will - that can - that will reduce the - those ambience.
