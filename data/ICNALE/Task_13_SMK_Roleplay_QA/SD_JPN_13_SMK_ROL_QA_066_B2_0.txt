 Uh. Umm. Uh. When I go to the restaurant with my friends, uh, those uh the friends are --- umm the friends are usually distant uh and we rarely see uh for a while, once in 1 year.
 So, when I went   those friends to the restaurant, we can uh eat good dinner and can talk a lot during the --- we didn't meet.
 Umm. Uh. It was very good dinner and, yeah, it reminds me very.
 Umm. Just uh going to the dinner, I like the Italian.
 Umm. Because Italian dish is very delicious and I like the Italian dishes.
 Uh. I don't.
 Umm. I don't in --- in that completely.
 I guess --- umm I think it is good to --- um I think it is enough for restaurants to separate the area, which is non-smoker --- which is for a non-smoker and which is for a smoker. And, yeah  
 Umm.
 So, I think make separate into three, non --- completely non-smoker and completely for smoker. And the third place --- third area is for the group, like you said uh, uh, some of them are non-smokers, and --- but others are smoker  . And so, separating into three parts is good for the restaurant.
