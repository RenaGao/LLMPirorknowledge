Sure.
Umm, I think one of the best is in my mom's birthday we went in a restaurant and everything was so good - the food, the environment, the - umm, the crews are very umm, very hospitable at the same time it's the environment that makes us pleased and everything is good and fine.
Umm, There is one place that we have eaten in XXX   and I think that's a Chinese restaurant and it's a new experience to eat using sticks at the same time - umm, it's a good things has the Chinese have and it's really something that is unique in my taste and I find it good.
Yes, I have to agree.
First of all, smoking has no benefit at all in health, in environment and in the whole Earth I think.  And because of that - umm, I really agree that smoking will be banned at all times at the same time, it's not just in the restaurant but in every public place that we have just have their smoke room in there, close the door and just stand in the room, then smoke and die alone.
