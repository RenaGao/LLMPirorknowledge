Yes.
I think the good restaurant for me - the good one that I have been to the - is open air restaurant located near the beach and there's two level and also there is a corner for children and - and there are - uh, someone providing, yes.  Just that.
Uh, Japanese.
Because - because, uh, again, the atmosphere, the - how - how they - how they design in the inside, and I think mostly - mostly Japanese restaurant, they give you a private - privacies - privacy as they divide the - the table into a section, and there's also some kind of cupboard between - between table to table, so you don't have to face with other or stranger when you are eating.
Uh, I do, because as I say, when you are having - having a meal in a restaurant and - and the restaurant is a place for many kinds of people like family, kids, uh, older people or general people, so not everyone that, uh, that like smoking or can handle the smoke, the smell of the smoke, so I think as the place for family or general people and as a restaurant, the smoke - smoking should be banned.
Okay.
