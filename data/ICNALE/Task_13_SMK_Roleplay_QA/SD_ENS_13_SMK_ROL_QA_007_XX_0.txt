I'm not a messy person.  Sorry.
Yeah.
A good one?
Uhm, yeah, actually here in Japan I went with one of my friends and her father to a sushi restaurant.  And it was quite expensive, you know, because it's -  it's not like the ones that go around.  You have to order.  And I think the total - the total was like more than $100 or something.  And then of course, you know, I wanted to pay my share of my food, but you know, the dad, you know, he wanted to pay for everything.  I was like, no, no, no, it's really expensive you know.  So but, you know, I could not say no to him, you know, he is just - he is like so nice.  So he paid for everything, you know.  So you know I don't -  it was my first time meeting him, so I think that was a really good experience.
Uhm, I -  I actually, I love going to the Indian restaurants.
Uhm, well, first is they are different uhm, I love the food.  I mean because they are actually -  you know they are actually made by actual Indian people.  Here if you go to a French restaurant usually you will not - never see French people.  In Italian restaurant you don't see Italian people making the food.  They are just all Japanese people.  But, you know, usually Indian food is quite original and the taste is original to it.
Okay.
No, I disagree.
Uhm, I am not a smoker but at the same time I'm not going to like - just  because I don't smoke, I am not going to force it on somebody else.  You know, many restaurants now they have smoking area and non-smoking areas.  I think that's -  that's enough.
