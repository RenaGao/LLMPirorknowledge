Um, if I have, I - I have never but XXX   about this?
Uh, uh, my experience.  Sometime I had, uh, just have the bad one too, but - but, uh, I think it is about the - the waiter.  Uh, this is about the waiter, not for the manager, but the waiter is not good by himself.  So, sometime we cannot do this like the one I do before.  I just think for myself, yes, he is not good, and then go to say for the manager that, uh---
Yeah, a complaint but not so, uh, terrible today, and then say that you not good, not good, and I will not go anymore.  I just go to complaint this waiter with his manager and then, uh, I will say that maybe you - you need to talk with him that he do something wrong or something not good, like that.
Yes.

The customer to eat in the restaurant.  They have a place for them to smoke - smoke outside or smoke in the, um, another room for - for especially them.  So, uh, yes, I agree with this, but - but - but now they have no anything like that, uh, yes, that disturb me, yes.
