Sure.
Uh, let's see ,uhm,  yeah, I mean - at - at a restaurant, we had been there with some friends and overall the atmosphere was good, food was good, prices were fair and as far as I recall, the - it was spacious enough that cigarette smoking was not - didn't really interfere with the experience.
Uh, let's see ,uhm,  I do enjoy Japanese food.  Uhm, it's good overall just because of the - well, like the different types of foods that are offered at least.  And also, I don't feel really guilty eating Japanese food as it tends to be a little bit healthier I feel.
Sure.
Uhm, I disagree just because I would prefer to allow people the right to choose to smoke, uhm, but hoping that there are - like sort of separated areas for people that choose and like to smoke and then those that do not want to deal with that because of course you can't really control where smoking is located.  But with the advent of sort of e-cigarettes I think it might not be a problem from that much longer in the first place as they are odorless for the most part and, uhm, yeah.  And I just don't think it will be much of a problem if e-cigarettes continue to grow in popularity.
