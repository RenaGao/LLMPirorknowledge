 Um-hmm.
 Uh, uh, maybe yesterday.
 I went to the good restaurant with my friends, a little bit expensive restaurant, uh, in --- in the French restaurant and in there, um, I can enjoy   the umm wine and umm some --- some --- some --- some --- the menu.
 I don't know so oh --- umm --- and the spaghetti or like that and I can enjoy the conversation with my friends.
 Uh-huh-huh, no.
 All male member.  
 Umm   umm maybe I --- I ate a good --- good meal last --- ye-yesterday, so I maybe I like the French, yeah.  
 Because my favorite food is tomato and fish.
 Uh, uh, sorry.
 Sorry-sorry, I   mistake, I went to Italian---  
 Yes---yes.
 Yes---yes.
 Yes.
 Yes, yes.
 Hmm.
 Yeah, I disagree with that.
 Because for the smoker, maybe to smoke and to enjoy the meal together is maybe good things maybe, so I think for the smoker that is a umm that is a umm choice for them I think, so if we --- if we criticize that maybe umm to have to ban or like that it's not so bad --- it's not so good for the smokers' preference I think.  
 Yes, so I --- as I said that --- that --- that for --- for that maybe divide --- dividing system is needed for each restaurant, yes.  
 Thank you.
