Um, actually whenever I eat at a restaurant with my family, I tend to always enjoy the moment.  It's - it's not about the food, it's about you enjoying with your family.
Uh, I don't really discriminate since food is food you know, so uh, wherever my family goes, I will go there and I will enjoy it.
Um, there are a lot of people who seems to be not be able to completely eradicate smoking.  So I think the best choice would probably to segregate those who would smoke in the area and those who would not, that will be win-win both sides.
