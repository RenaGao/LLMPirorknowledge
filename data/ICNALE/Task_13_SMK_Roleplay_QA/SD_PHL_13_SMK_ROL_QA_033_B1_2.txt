Umm I am really sorry.
Umm me and my family rarely go to restaurant but when we go to restaurant, we usually go as a large family like my the family of my mother with the family of my father.  And usually it's a very good experience because we can catch up with each other's lives and ask how you are doing.
Umm we as a family we often go to Chinese restaurants.
Because that sa at our family there is a line of Chinese people and that makes us familiar with Chinese cooking.  So we are very fond of it.
Umm I agree sir because if you are going to smoke, there are designated areas in at some places where to smoke.  So naturally as a human, you would not think about smoking around others, especially around others who are consuming food because smoke second-hand smoke is much more dangerous than the smoke that's going into the first guy's mouth.  And you are conshuming   food but you are also inhaling smoke, so that makes it more dangerous.
