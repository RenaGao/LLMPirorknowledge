Yeah sure.
Yes sir.
Yes.
Well, I enjoyed a meal with my family at Tulip and I ate biryani, uh, mutton, beef, so many cold drinks, so I really enjoyed over there, uh, my brothers, uh, even the - my uncle and my aunt, all people were with me and that was the most amazing time in my life.  We were heading towards Islamabad.
Sir, I have an experience at Italian, uh, restaurant because...
...because their food is very tasty and their conditions and as you know that - that were very spick and span for me...

Yes.  I totally agree with this statement...
