Yes, I have, uh, some good experience at a restaurant, because the sellers, they, they are very good at me, they are - how they treat me, that is very - the, the way they treat me is very good.  For example, like if we want to order something, they give a very good service.  So, that is, for me, a very good experience for me at that restaurant XXX  .
Actually, I like an Indian restaurant, because they - they cook very nice meal.  For example, like they have, you know, ���roti-chana' and - and then some paratha, and then XXX  .  So, that is my favorite, my favorite dish.  So, that's why I like to go to the, uh, Indian restaurant---
Yeah.  All right.  Finally, some people say that smoking should be banned, completely banned at all restaurants in the country.  Do you agree or disagree?  Why?  I agree with the statement that said that smoking should be banned in our restaurant because smoking is not good for our health.  And I think - from my experience, even though - even though they still - even though there is a lot of sshh, sign orders, a lot of advertisement that have been declared by the government, there is still, make some, just still smoke at the area, even though it is  a  already completely  por  prohibited for them to smoke there but  the  XXX   just break the laws.  They just keep on smoking.  And finally, when they get caught by the - by the officers, or - yeah, by the officers, they just go and  fin , uh, pay the summons, they start to smokes again.  So, that - that's why I think, smoking should be banned, because it give a very lot of negative effects towards humanity - humanity.
