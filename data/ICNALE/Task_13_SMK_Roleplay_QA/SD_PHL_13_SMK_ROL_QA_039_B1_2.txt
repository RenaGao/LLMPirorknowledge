Sir can you sir.
My good experience in a restaurant was when I ate together with my family in a place where more there air is the air is is clean and good and the place where we eat where we eat there is no people smoking in the same place.  So so then ah we eat happily we eat together and happy to talk with the some staff and so on we end up in the good memory in the place.
I pref I prefer for Japanese restaurants.
Ah Japan restaurant because it has the same similarity it has the same culture as we as we have in our home.  So there therefore it is like in the same and comfortable eat with them.
I agree because I agree because smoking is not ah smoking is not good for while while while we eat in the restaurant and we can appreciate the food better if we if we smell the smoke.
