Hmm.
Yeah, of course.
Uh, okay.  I think, uh, a good atmosphere of - in the restaurant is the most important park   like they will turn lighter of the lights or they will play some soft music.  Uh, also apart from the atmosphere, the decoration is also important, like they will, uh, put some wa - uh, drawing on the wall or put some items which is match with the theme of the restaurant, uh, in the corner.  So, people pass by or people enjoying their meal can also, uh, appreciating or have a look of those artists.  So, I think decoration and lighting is important.
Yeah.
I like French food the best, uh, although it is the most expensive one.  Uh, the atmosphere there is so attractive and the culture of eating French food is, uh, so, yeah it's so cool because, eh, French foods they have different type of food, they will give you appetizer first and then the main and lastly the drinks and the desserts.  However the food are so - and the food is so small, uh, if you are super hungry or you are a big eater you won't get satify - satisfy, however they put - they focus on quality instead of quantity.  They will, uh, make the food, uh, attractive and they will give you different layers.  For example, the macaron, which is a desserts of French food, and the outer layer of the macaron is crispy and, eh, colorful while, uh, between the macaron - between two biscuits of the macaron they will have a softy, creamy of cream, so they will have two layer which is crispy and softy, so while you bite the macaron you will get different layers which is, uh, Japanese food or Chinese food cannot be imitated.  So, I think, this, uh, eating experience is interesting and of course, and the atmosphere there is so, uh, so good.  Yeah.
Hmm.
I totally agree, uh, perha - prohibit people smoke in the restaurant because, uh, there is people, they are not, uh, smoking - they are not smokers, uh, and the restaurant normally is a indoor restaurant.  And there is not - they don't have a lot of air inflow, so, uh, when you smoke, uh, the cigarettes, I mean the - yeah the cigarettes may - the smoke of the cigarette may, uh, flow to the next desk of the customer while they don't want to be affect.  And also the smoke is so strong and they will make your nose feel uncomfortable.  And also while you are eating, you don't want because eating you are enjoying the taste also the smell when you eat in a restaurant full of smokes, and of - definitely you will be affected and you will lost the taste of the food.  Yeah, and ultimately the most important reason is, uh, there is a lots of harmful substan   in the smoke, while you - people are smoking and the two-hands - uh, two-hand - two-hand smoker - two-hand smoke - two-hand, eh, cigarettes, yeah, two-hand cigarettes is also harm - harmful to us even we are not smoking.  So, smoking is not just affecting yourself but also affecting unconscious people.
Yeah.
