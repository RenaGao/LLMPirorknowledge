Um, I think the - the wait - the waitress in the restaurant is pretty kind and she was access because it's small restaurant so there is and when - when the time - by the time we went - we go there it's not dining time.
And There is only two group of people - two groups of people in the restaurant.  So, they can just - they will just come to our table and ask us if we need something.
I like American restaurant specially.
Um, I just I like the food - I like the burgers and fries.
I think I agree in the restaurant.
Yeah because other people are eating meal.  So, I think that really cause somebody's dining experience to be bad or something.
That we are ruining their meal.
