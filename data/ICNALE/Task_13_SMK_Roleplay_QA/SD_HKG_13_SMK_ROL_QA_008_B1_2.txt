Uh, sure.  Uh, I went to a Japanese restaurant, uh, last week with my, uh, old schoolmates from XXX   School and, uh, in the restaurant, we ordered some sasami and some, uh, just - Japanese, uh, uh, like, uh, the noodles and the Japanese rice, uh, there.  I think that Japanese food are fresh and they are, uh - they are good to eat, because I think the sasami offered a tasty, especially for, uh, salmon and for tuna.  Uh, so I think, uh, it is good experience for me to go there and I will recommend this restaurant and recommend my, uh, experience to my friends and also family members.  Uh, and I would like to, uh, bring down to this restaurant to have, uh, dinner again.
I would like, uh, the, um, Korean food most because I like spicy - spicy food and I think, uh, spicy food, uh, greater amount of interest about eating them.  Uh, and so, uh, the style and the tradition for having a Korean cuisine is, uh, the best among other choices.
Uh, I strongly agree with, uh, not allowing, uh, custom - customers to smoke in all - all restaurants and they should be banned.  Uh, because, uh, to have rights and protect the health of others, uh, we should respect, uh, the people who are not, uh, smoking and who dislike, uh, smoking.
