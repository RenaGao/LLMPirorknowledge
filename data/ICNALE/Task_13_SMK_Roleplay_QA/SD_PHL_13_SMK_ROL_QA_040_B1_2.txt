Favorite restaurant.  Last week something like this?
Umm Shakey's.
Ah because umm their food was nice and so we have think of our brother because she always want I he also wanted fried chicken so for us the best XXX  fried chickens at Shakey's.
Umm I tried Chinese restaurant but I am not really convinced.  So I I stand with the Filipino XXX .
I agree because because primarily because it's a restaurant.  I think it's not it's not bad to think of other others sometimes.  And some restaurant there is a place to eat.  So I think we just gave ourselves or themselves time to stop smoking for a moment for just just eating.
