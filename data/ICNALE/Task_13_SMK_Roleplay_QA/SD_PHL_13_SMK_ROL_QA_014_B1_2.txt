Ah, there's one restaurant in particular that I really enjoyed, because ah, because some restaurants when I'm with my grandfather and I'm with my grand, grandparents, they always ah, have image, because how slow the, the servings, especially they are old and they are irritated of the situations always.  And ah, that restaurant have   the ability to give orders and, and to ah, have our meals on, on time and that's why my grandparents enjoyed it.
Ah, Filipino.
Because I love Filipino foods.  Of course, I'm also Filipino.
Ah, I agree, because as a, as a guy who have asthma since birth ah, I need to have the ah, air that is freely, that is free from ah, second, from secondhand smoking or carbon dioxide so that I can have fresh air in that I, I can inhale and, and also to avoid toxication in the environment.
