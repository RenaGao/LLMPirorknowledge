Um, uh, I used to go to a restaurant named XXX   with my friends and I think the - the atmosphere there is quite good, the restaurant is quite big and I can sit with my friends there for quite a long time and the food and drinks are also, uh, delicious.  We can like have a nice chat in the afternoon when we go to that restaurant.
Um, I like Japanese restaurants because, um, I think Japanese cuisine is quite good like, um, sometimes I eat the sushi or the - the fish - I forget what it is called and, um, also the ramen is quite tasty too, although it is expensive.
Hmm, I will agree with that because the restaurant is a place for people to eat and, um, you don't know what people will like is there - like here maybe some students or just some children so it is better to ban smoking for the kids and also if people want to smoke, they should just go to smoke in the areas that allow them to do it and not in the restaurants that's what affects the other people eating there.
