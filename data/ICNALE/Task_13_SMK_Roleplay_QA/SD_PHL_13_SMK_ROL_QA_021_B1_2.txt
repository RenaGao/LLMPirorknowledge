I have a good experience when I have my birthday celebration in one of the restaurant and - and the management is really approachable and they - the - the environment in that restaurant is really clean.
Japanese restaurant, because I like ramen.
Agree.  Because restaurants serve food - a healthy food that can satisfy their customer.  So I think it is ironic if - if they doesn't have any - any prohibited rules in the - in the restaurant.  And of course, they will - they should consider the health of their customer and be considerate about it.  It is also, show a respect for their customer.
