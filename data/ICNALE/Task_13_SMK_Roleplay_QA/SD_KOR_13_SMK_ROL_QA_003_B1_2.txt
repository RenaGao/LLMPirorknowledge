Yeah.
Mmm, a week ago, my sister visited me in this area and I had a meal with her and her boyfriend and the food was very good.  We had a chicken.
Yeah, it was very good.  Yeah.
Yeah.
I prefer Korean restaurant which is the best. 
Because I love Korean food.
And then I get really familiar with the Korean food and there are lots of menus in the Korean restaurant.
Yeah.  And I like it.
Yeah.
All the restaurants - I think not all restaurants I think.
Mmm, in my case I can't stand the smoking.
So, I hope so that all the restaurants ban smoking inside of the restaurants.  However, there is some smokers definitely in this country, right?
So, mm, very limited restaurants it allows - I think it can allow there - allow that smoking inside.  But they have to notice to their customers before like starting a meal.
