Well, I had a very wonderful experience in a hot pot restaurant.  Um, it had a very great, uh, service like my mother - my mother - it's my mother - mother's birthday party in this restaurant so they even prepared the gift for my mother, so it is very great.
Yeah, it's like a very small box of perfume.  It was wonderful.
Mmm.
I enjoyed Chinese restaurant because I like the traditional Chinese food, like hot foods and some other restaurants I actually - I don't use to eat this kind of food.
I am allergic to seafood, so I don't go to Japanese restaurants very frequently.
Allergic.
Um, A few years ago.
I intend to disagree with this opinion because I think it is a very strong and strict regulation for some people, uh, because I think we don't have to ban all the smoking in all the places because - because people can choose.  If they don't smoke they can choose the restaurant that ban the smoking, so we don't have to ban all the smoking in all the places.
Mmm, yeah.
