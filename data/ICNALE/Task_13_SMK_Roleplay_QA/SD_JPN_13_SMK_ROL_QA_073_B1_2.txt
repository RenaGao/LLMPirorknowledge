 Um-hmm.
 At the restaurant?
 Umm, okay, uh-huh-huh, yeah umm this day I uh like to umm go to lunch with our lunch passport and visit uh.
 I can enjoy meals umm only umm in 5 --- umm 500 --- uh 500 yen.
 Uh, but umm yeah this lunch passport is a book and umm we should have uh one book for a person umm but umm yeah maybe last week, I went with my friend and I recommend her to go to a restaurant, which is recommended in the lunch --- in this book and I went there and I asked the owner --- umm no, I --- I --- I don't --- I didn't ask, I just said the owner or --- only I have a lunch passport book but my friend doesn't have --- didn't have, uh, so I --- yeah I --- I just --- uh-huh-huh, I just explained the situation but the owner umm allowed us to eat uh with 500 coin  .
 Not only me but us.
 So, he was very kind.  
 Uh, original price was 1200.
 Um-hmm.
 I --- I --- we were very sorry.
 Umm, I like the umm maybe Japanese restaurant.
 Umm, because umm sushi --- we cannot make sushi at home.  
 But like Italian, we can make from uh --- no, or we can buy some to --- some piece like, not bread but, how to say, like the, huh-huh-uh --- how to say in English?
 Uh   some --- uh some   materials from it --- are made   bread.
 Uh, or we --- or we can make Italian food uh-huh at my house and actually, I don't like French because for me, it's only expensive but not good taste.
 Um-hmm.
 Um-hmm.
 Umm, I definitely disagree with it.
 Because I worked at a restaurant where people are smoking and maybe --- yeah, most of the people are smoking and if like government umm makes a law uh which is prohibit   a smoke --- no --- smoking is prohibit   at the restaurants, this kind of restaurant umm will have --- will have to be closed.
 Hmm.
