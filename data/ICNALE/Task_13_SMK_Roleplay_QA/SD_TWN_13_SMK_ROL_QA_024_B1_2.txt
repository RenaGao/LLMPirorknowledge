I went to the restaurant last Tuesday and we go to the hot - hot pot - hot pot.  We went to have the hot pot and I have a very good experience there.
Korean restaurant.
Because I like to eat kimchi.
I disagree.  I think smoke - smoking is very bad but they have their right to have food eat, so - but I think the smoking restaurant should be apart from the non-smoking restaurant.
