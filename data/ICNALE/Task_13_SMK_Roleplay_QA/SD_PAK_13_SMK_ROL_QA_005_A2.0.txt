Yes, sir.  Mmm, last week I go with my friends, uh, at a restaurant, uh, it - it was very clean restaurant and the staff there was very cooperative and, uh, the food was very delicious and, uh, tasteful.
Uh, I like the restaurant, uh, with our continental food, uh, that is in our city.
Because, uh, I born in that environment and I, uh, eat mostly of the continental food and I don't experience the other food.
Yes, I think it should be banned at all restaurants.
Because, uh, mmm, if somebody, uh, want to smoke, they should go at a - that place specific for smoking, not at everywhere at restaurant or other public places.
