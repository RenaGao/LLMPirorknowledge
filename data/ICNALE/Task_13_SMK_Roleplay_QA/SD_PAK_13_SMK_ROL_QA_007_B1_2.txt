I like, uh, you know the Pakistani food.
Pakistani food is our taste and, uh, uh, often if - if I - I would say, uh, I - I had an experience at Chinese restaurant.  They make Chinese but not like, you know, Chinese food.   They, you know - mm, you know manipulate the taste as well.
I think, uh - uh, I think it's better to have your own meal or you know have their meal at their place; they would be, uh, definitely the same taste.
