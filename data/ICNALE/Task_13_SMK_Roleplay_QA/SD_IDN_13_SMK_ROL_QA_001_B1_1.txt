So, I'm going there often like twice a month because it's quite bit expensive.  But it's really good.
Uh, Yeah, I am, I prefer for the food taste than the restaurant.
Oh, I like - actually the Western restaurant, the Western food, yeah.  I prefer the Western food.
I don't know.  Maybe the taste is suitable with me rather than the others.
Yeah, yeah.
I am agree with this thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, like I tell you before, I am already living abroad.  And as my - in my experience all of the restaurant in - in some of the country already banned the smoking.
