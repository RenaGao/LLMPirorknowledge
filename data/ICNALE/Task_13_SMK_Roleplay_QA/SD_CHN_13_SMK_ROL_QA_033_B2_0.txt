Um, I - I - I will like to talk about XXX   hot pot.  Um, it's a very famous hot pot in China, and one day, we - we went to eat at there.  Um, you know, before you - before you eat, you have to wait in line, and they provide you some fruits, some snacks.  So, it's very good and when you - when we are eating, the - the waitress is always, um, have a big smile on her face and - and she always know what you need and give it to you.  So - uh, and after - after we - after we eating, she also give us her recharge number and said to us that, uh, if next time you come to eat, please tell me and I will - I will make a reservation before you come so you will not need to wait for long time.
Um, I like Chinese restaurant.
Uh, I - I am the kind of person who really like spicy flavor, so I don't think those kind of restaurant can suit my - my preference.
Yeah.
I - I totally agree because I think smoking is a - smoking - smoking cannot be accept by most of the people.  So, it will do harm for your health and even they lead to disease - disease - disease or cancer and so if some - some people want to smoke, um, they can go out to smoke.  And, um, I think restaurants could have some smoking areas so provide some places for those people.
