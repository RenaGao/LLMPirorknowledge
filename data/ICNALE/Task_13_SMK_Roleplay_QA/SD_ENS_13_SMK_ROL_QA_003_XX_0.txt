Thank you.
Yes I have many times.
Well, we usually go to a family restaurant or mainly Sushi restaurants because we - things that we don't cook at home.  So it was very pleasant to have a family gathering as we don't do that often.  So I guess I have many so I don't know which one to.
To choose from, but it's very - very - a good bonding if you go with your family.
I always prefer Japanese.
Well, I am a health conscious person and I think Japanese food is - is much healthy and - and I - I used to - well, I have lived here for a long time so I tried - I am a little picky on where we go.  And if I have a choice, I try to go to a Japanese restaurant.
Well, smokers have the right to smoke, but there should be a limitation for where they can smoke and which restaurant they can smoke, and the area where they can smoke  .
I don't think it should be banned at all.
