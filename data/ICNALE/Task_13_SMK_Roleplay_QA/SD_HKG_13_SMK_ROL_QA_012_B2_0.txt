Sure, yes.  Um, a very good restaurant, um - instead of the restaurant I will say it's a very good memory for us - uh, for my family is a - is a western cuisine and, uh, we had a very good time celebrating my mother's birthday there and due to the separation - the separation, actually I can only met my father once a year so that time we had a very good meal.  And so - my - I met my father and that restaurant actually put on a very, um, great celebration for us like they played the music and a live band and also they gave us a very big and nice cake.  And, uh, family actually had a wonderful picture by their staff and that is a very good memory, and I always remember that restaurant whenever I need, uh, take meal or like celebration for any one near, yeah.
Japanese.  I guess--- 
---so many Hong Kong girls love Japanese cuisine, yes.  And I like, um - I like sasami, the - the taste is good with the soya sauce, I don't know why, it's just good.  And also I, um - I'm a seafood fan because seafood have a very good taste and - yes also that's why I love Japanese cuisine so much.
Super agree.
Because, um, in the restaurant sometimes you may not only, uh, have, uh, adults but also kids and also elderlies, those are people who are very, um, um, allergic to smokes and they really shouldn't, uh, get in touch with any of bad, um, gas because it's bad to their health and also bad to everyone health.  So, I do think that smoking have no advantage or benefits to anyone at all, and that's why I think that smoking in restaurant or even anywhere on this world, on this planet should also be basically banned.
