Um, I went to the Italian restaurant with my family 2 weeks ago.  The food was good and my dad tried to pay by credit card, but their machine was not XXX so my dad paid by cash.  At that moment, the owner of the restaurant gave us a fancy dessert for XXX .
He was very kind.
Um, I love Japanese restaurants because I like to eat noodles or sushi.
Um, I agree.
Um, all of us know that passive smoking is not good for our health and I think smoker can get out of the restaurant and smoke.
