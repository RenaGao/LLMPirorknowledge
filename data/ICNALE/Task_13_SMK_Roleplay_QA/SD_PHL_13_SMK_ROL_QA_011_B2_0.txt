Ah, umm, I think in that restaurant, it was, it was a buffet.  It was, I think it was last year Decem, last year in December when we were eating at that restaurant.  And it was very fun because all my friends was   there and it was a special event.
I think I like the best is still Filipino.
Because it is our dish, it, it is the dish that our palate enjoys the most.
I think smoking should be banned on some, on some restaurants.  But I think there should be restaurants where it is allowed.  But there should be a separate room for smokers.
