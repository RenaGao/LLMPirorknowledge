Yes sir.
Yes sir, I went to the restaurant at Jhelum with my friends.  I planned a tour with my friend, class fellows.
These are something that best place, that first of all, I think there is some smoking zone area at first.  You can - if you are smoker, you can easily smoke at that place.  There is only entrance of smokers.  There is a separate place for the - that don't like smoking that - that I like that very much.
Uh, as I like the Japanese the most.
Because there is reception and there is traditions, also I like the most.
Yes sir.
Uh, I agree, that should be banned, but as I have told you that my experience, there is some smoking area zone that - that smoke, that person addicted, there is some place that he can easily enjoy that smoke and that don't disturb to the others.  There are some separate place.  If that is our separate place, that should be banned.
