Okay.
Yes, Mm-hmm.
Okay.  Um, should I mention the name of the restaurant?
Okay.  Um, a couple of months back, I went to a restaurant called - named Marinate with my friends and the good thing about that was - about that restaurant was the food especially, you can say, what was it, Mexican steak and I really enjoyed it.  Actually, I don't go out often so this was the good experience I would like to visit that restaurant again.
I haven't tried any one of them.
No.
I disagree.
Uh, as I said before that people should be allowed to do whatever they like to do.
