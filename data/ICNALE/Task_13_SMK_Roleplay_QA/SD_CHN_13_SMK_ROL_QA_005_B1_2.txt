One restaurant?
Because I love the spicy food, I remember, uh, a restaurant when I was still in China I went the restaurant with my friends.  Um, that's really spicy.
And my friends, um, after that dish there get, they get - got a stomachache but I didn't.
That's spicy but, um, okay I - I like that.
Do I like the best?  Um, I think that might be the - although a little bit weird, it's the fast food restaurant.
Uh, although, uh, no matter where you are, the flavor is the same.
So, uh, you know in the, uh, maybe the Japanese food in China and the Chinese food in Japan, uh, their flavors is not the, uh, correct flavor.  It's not the, uh, usual flavor.  It will change the - uh, its flavor, uh, at the local peoples so---
Uh, McDonalds.
For me, I agree with this because I have smoking to, umm, that although it's a totally stops the smoking might be a little bit - I don't know but for me, I agree with it but for some people, uh, it's - uh, it's impossible for them to accept the - this policy, so me I agreed.
