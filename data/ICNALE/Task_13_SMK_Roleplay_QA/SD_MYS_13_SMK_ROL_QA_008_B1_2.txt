Uh, one of the, I, I did it a couple weeks ago, I went to Cyberjaya.
And I have a picnic with my best friend.  We celebrate our relationship for two years to be the best friend.  We celebrate it and we really enjoy.
Okay.
Of course, Malay.
Because maybe I was born from, because maybe I was, uh, raised by my mom to eat Malay food.
And I never tried any Japanese, Japanese cuisine.
Even for a sushi, I never tried it.  I don't know how it tastes like.
I feel like yeah, it doesn't taste good.
My friends say, and then I tell her, "Okay, no, no, no.  I'm not going to try it because you say it's not delicious at all."
And also Chinese because Chinese you know, uh, my friends told me that their, their soup is just like you drink a plain, a plain water.
And then, you know, I am the person who is okay when my friends told me about, "Okay, this is not good.  This isn't good."  So, I'm not going to try.  I listen about what people tell me.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes, I, I agree.
Because it is disturbing other customers.
Maybe the customers have a disease with, you know, like asthma or maybe, maybe, uh, the customers like to take care of their, of their health by not smelling the smoking.
Because the second smoker is dangerous from the, who are smoker.
Mm-hmm.
