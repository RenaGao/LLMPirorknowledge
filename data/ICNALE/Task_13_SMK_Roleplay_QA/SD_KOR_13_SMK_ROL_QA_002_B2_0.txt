Having meal.
Uh, when I was like kid like 12 or 13 years old kid, every, whenever I got like prize thing the paper thing, then - then my family go out to eat, uh, pork like.  So, I really try hard to like get the things from school.  So, that time I - we did that until I graduate from the middle school.
So, the family out like after the prize, so that was a good memory.
Of course, I like Korean best.
But second one, I - these days I like Vietnamese.
I - I like - I really like pho.
Pho.
Pho, rice noodle.
Yeah.
I agree I think. 
Uh, first I am a non-smoker.
So, I don't really like people smoking around me.
But and like especially in the building if the - the smoking smell remains really long and it sticks in like wall or something and fabric too.  So - so I agree.
