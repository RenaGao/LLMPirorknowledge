Um, actually I - I do not mind which restaurant.  I only mind who is eating with me.
I like to go out with my friends because we can talk about almost everything.  But if you go out with your parents, uh, maybe there is - there are - there is something you don't want to talk about with them.
Service?
Uh, service.
Not particular - particular.  Uh, so---
Uh, I often go to the Japanese restaurant to eat ramen, but in some festivals, Chinese festivals especially - especially the Chinese festival I go to the Chinese restaurant, eat some Chinese traditional food.
Uh, hmm, but you have no choice.
If near is - uh, if there is no best one, you have to choose the second best.
The most difference is - the - the spicy food.
Uh, in - in Japan, Japanese food, the spicy food, you can taste a kind of, uh, sweet.
Hmm, the - uh, I don't know why, but you - uh es - es - uh, especially the XXX , uh, is kind of sweet, uh, but in China it's really hot - hot, spicy, yeah.
Umm, uh, uh, at first I should, uh, uh, say that I am not smoker.  I am not a smoker.  So, I think it's - it - it is good for me and some no - and for some - someone who do not smoke to forbit smoking in the restaurant, but I don't think it is - uh, it is reasonable to - to do this.  Because, um, actually there are so many people who - who smoke, so forbid - forbid - uh, so the forbid - forbidding is good but cannot be - cannot be taken into reality.
For - for example, which country?
Europe.
Hmm.  So, it can - uh, just a start - start from several restaurants and see the result, uh, whether it - it is good or not.  It is - uh, if it is good, you can spread it.  If it is not, then you can give up.
