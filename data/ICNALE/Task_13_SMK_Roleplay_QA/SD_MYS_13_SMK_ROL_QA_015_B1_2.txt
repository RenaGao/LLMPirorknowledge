So uh I love Malayu restaurant because Malayu is a traditional  .
Yes, Malay restaurant.
So because Malay restaurant provide traditional food that you can't find at other places like Chinese restaurant and sushi and like that kind of food.  But I love traditional food and I am really a Malay kid basically.
Yes, for me it, it should be banned because - why - because as people know that cigarette have like kind of chemical property like, uh, what we call the tar tar.  It makes you - when you firstly smoke cigarette, you will find it that you want it again and again and again.  So basically, uh, ban in restaurant because uh the vapor from the cigarette, uh, could be dangerous uh to people when people is eating food and you can smell that kind of bad vapors.  So it's not good.
