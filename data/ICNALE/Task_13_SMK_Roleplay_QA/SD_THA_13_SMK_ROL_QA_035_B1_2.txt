Restaurant - um, can I enjoy it - uh, as the - I have not enjoyed as not the customer.
But as staff.  Can I do that?  
Um, when I was in internship again, uh, I was in another section with, uh - with the restaurant but I do go there a lot.  Uh, the man - manager and the staff there were very kind.  Uh, every time I go there, they just talk to me and sometimes they just give me some food and drinks.  I don't know I - kind of it's my weak point.
Yeah.  I am growing up and I - I don't feel - I don't feel much kindness.
Just that you think.
I would say Italian.
I like food that involves cheese and a lot of meat.  So, the Italian will be a good choice.  Something like that.
Um, they don't - they didn't have to do that.  Uh, if anything that - if anything that affect him - affect the - on from the freedom of smoking.  So, that's his - uh, that's they are doing.  Uh, if a - a customer like me, if I don't want to smell the cigarette, so I - the - the restaurant that won't be my option anyway.
