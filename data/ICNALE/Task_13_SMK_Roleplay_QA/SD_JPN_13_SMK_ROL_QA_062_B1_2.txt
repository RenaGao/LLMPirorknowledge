 Okay. Uh. Last month, I went to restaurant in NOKOMICHI   with my club member   to say goodbye to my --- to a member of my club, who is from America, to study in J --- in Japan.
 I was very sad but it's   very fun.
 We ate Hayashi Rice many times and we can talk very much and we had a very good time.
 It's my uh great memory.
 Umm. I --- I like umm ramen restaurant.
 Because it's yummy.
 Yes.
 Delicious. I like it.
 Hmm.
 Yes, I agree.
 Because smoking is uh bad for everyone's health, and   restaurant is public place, many people are there; even a child will   be there.
 The influence of smoking means very big for them, and if all of the restaurants banned smoking, smoker   have many smoke points where they can smoke in that place.
 So, it's not so --- so much big --- big damage for smokers.  
 Umm. Uh. Some people say that but some people smoke even in a restaurant or umm some other public places.
 So, we can't believe that smokers want to, so umm.
 Hmm.
