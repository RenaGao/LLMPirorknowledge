Good experience - well, there are many restaurants.
Well, I - I cannot remember the specific restaurant but like - what I enjoy was the food and the - the staffs   were very kind.
A little bit difficult.
Yeah.
I agree.
Well, smoking affects the experience of eating and enjoying the food.  And well because I don't like smoking - like - like it's very bad for the health, especially inside a restaurant, if like a closed room, especially for the nonsmoker, like it's very bad.
