I have, uh, taken a meal, uh, in Emporium Mall recently with my friends on a - when we were on tour, and we ordered a deal from a CHACHAJEE  and we enjoyed that meal.
I like the best Chinese.
Because it - because the taste of their food is very different from others.
And its - there is not much, uh, uh, much delicious - it, uh, delicious food but the, uh, salt is very, uh, low in their - quantity in their food. 
I'm agreeing this policy.
Because it - uh, it causes problems for others.  It's not, uh, good habit for the health.
