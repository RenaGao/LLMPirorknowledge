The last time that I ate inside a restaurant with my friends was really fun because it was ah birthday surprise for my friend, and we had a lot of fun during ah while we are eating.
I would always prefer Filipino restaurant.
Because umm because I am used to it and umm I am not I into I am not into exp I am not that adventurous enough to ah try a lot of taste that is not familiar to my taste.
I do agree with that because first of all it is not good for many people especially to those second-hand sm I I mean those who are second-hand smokers.
