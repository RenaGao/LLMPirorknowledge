Okay.
Of course.
Well, there is a - and so, there is a - a restaurant in Todai---
---which is like seafood buffet and it's a little bit expensive, but when, when my family like visited there, there is so much good food like drinks and you know, there - there is food that we cannot usually eat like such as steaks.  In Korea, we - we don't eat often and you know like - and sushis and they are really expensive when you go to the other restaurant, but you can just pay like - like $40 per person maybe I think and - and you can enjoy all the food you want and that is so, I really like that restaurant.
Okay.
Near?
You mean near this?
University?
Well, I like Japanese restaurant very much.
Because Chinese food, uh, there is too more - it's more, much greasy than other food.
Yeah, when I visited China like last summer, it was really bad, because all the - like in hot summer, all the foods are greasy and I really don't like greasy food.
Yeah.
I disagree.
No, no.
Yeah.
Because, um, I think I need to like - we also need to respect smokers as well, because they pay taxes for the cigarettes, because you know, cigarettes like - they are like 90% I think they are our taxes.
So, they paid for the cigarette, but they also paid for - they like paid taxes.  So, the - the - our country needs to like build more like facilities for smokers just like, you know, like containers to smoke or make a smoking area more clearly and I think that makes more clean society.
