Okay.
A what?
A food, okay.  A meal, okay.
About meal?
Oh.  What kind of story do you want to hear?
Okay, so uh, my family really love having seafood XXX  .  So most of the time we go by the sea and sit like, how to say, we go to restaurant by the sea and we order food like some typical food from the restaurant.  And actually we just have it and enjoy the time together.  Yeah.
What - what - what detail do you want to know?
Okay.
Yes, Korean probably.
And now probably they have Indian.
Um, the best, is that include Thai food?
Okay, so I go for Thai food.
I love Som Tum.
Yes, probably a salad.
Because of the food, from - from, because you're asking about the good, didn't you, about the restaurant, so basically I just---
Because of - there are many kinds of things like some, uh, that the northeast food and also they have various kind because I found like our Thai food have plenty, uh, various kinds of food.  Yes.
Okay.
You mean like should be banned?
In deeply, I really want to say yes, but in general, of course we can, we understand that most of people, they how to say---
---they - they got to smoke or sometime like they was try to get rid of smoking, so but anyways you have to smoke.  Because if you don't smoke, like how to say, they have another way another treatment but, anyway, if they have smoke, probably like they should go to the restaurant that have designed   area for smoking.  That would be better.  I didn't mean to ban them, but I just mean to have them the place to smoke instead of deserving - disturbing the other.
Yes, I disagree.
They can smoke in some area, some restricted area.  
Yes.
Okay.
