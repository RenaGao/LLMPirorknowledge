Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, well I - I - actually I like eating out a lot and I eating, like trying different types of food and so I always invite friends out to and family too out to try different things.  And so when they like something that I want them to try, obviously it makes me feel good.
Yeah, for example, actually one of my former students and it was in America after I left the job and after he graduated um, we decided to go to a casino because the steak there was just delicious.  And so - and we had a good relationship and so we went and um, yeah, and we ordered steaks and he had a bit and he was like "It's damn good" and I was like "Yeah, I know" and that was - yeah, it made me feel good and I am glad he had a good experience.  He was an international student as well.  So---
The most um, right now?
My favorite restaurant.  Well, it depends on my mood.  I don't have - I don't have a favorite restaurant.  I like - I like trying new things, so actually tonight I am going to go out with a couple of friends and we're probably going to go eat at a BASASHI   restaurant which is well of course sushi or sashimi yeah, and yeah, that's what.  I am looking forward to it.
Ah, no.
I disagree because I think it's up to the - the restaurant owners themselves and yeah, so if they want to allow smokers, then can have it and they can have a sign that says smoking is allowed or smoking is not allowed. 
They need Braille too.
Yeah.
