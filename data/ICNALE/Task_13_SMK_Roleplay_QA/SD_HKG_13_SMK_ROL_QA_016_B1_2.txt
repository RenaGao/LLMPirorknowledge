Uh, the recent meal that I enjoy with my friends is about a friend's birthday and we have, uh, uh, meal of Hot Pot and we are - though it's a Wednesday evening and it's really expensive, but it has - it has, you know, very long time that we haven't, uh, been eating Hot Pot together and enjoy some ice-cream as well, enjoy some meat and to chat for a few hours.
Uh, Japanese.
Uh, because maybe Japanese has blend different countries' flavor like, uh, they are having rice in a very hot - I don't know how to say - the stone bowl and then it is like the one in Korea, but it's not the - the same ingredient - not the same in ingredient and it's very fun to find different ingredient makes them together also the sushi, and sashimi and it's not something you can find in other countries.
Um, yes, I agree because smoking is not good to one's health and not good to the others, especially others.  And while you are all eating in a restaurant, it is you cannot afford, uh, breathing in the air around you.
And if you are doing smoking, next to a person who is eating, you will affect her or his health and it is better to ban it so that there is a, uh - reducing the risk of getting other disease like the cancer.
