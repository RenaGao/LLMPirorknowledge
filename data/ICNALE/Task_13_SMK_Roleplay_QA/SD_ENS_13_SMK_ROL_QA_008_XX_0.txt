Yeah.
I see - I think a good experience would be - I think a recent example would be YAKINIKU   restaurants where they provided a menu as well as the TABEHOUDAI   experience, so you can choose some like special - special meat.  And if you ask the staff, they would like recommend like the A versus the B.  And uh, let me see the - the atmosphere was really good, not so many people.  It's not very crowded and let me see - you can - you can enjoy the time with the group but the restaurant also has a reasonable time limit, like 90 minutes of where you can eat as much as you can.  So people aren't really like lingering or taking up space for an excessive amount of time.
Let me see, I prefer to go to the places that are more open, you don't have to wait for very long, so specially in Umeda the restaurants usually you have to wait a pretty long time for dinner and lunch can have some crowds, that's difficult if you're going with one or more companions.  So alone you can find a single seat but in the Umeda area it's kind of a lots of business diner type place.
Well, the best restaurant that I like to visit in this area is the KAMIYAKI   restaurants near the station, so one or two people can get in easily.  There might be a 10-minute wait, but a KAMIYAKI   usually has a short preparation time and - and a quick turnaround, so.
Uh, I disagree.  I know that for some restaurants it's an important part of their atmosphere, especially for places that cater to the older generation.  So for example the Japanese Diet recently was reviewing laws about this, but - but a survey of a Diet shows that most of them are men who over 60 years old and who smoke, so that's really not representative of the population as a whole.  So that was kind of an interesting look at the people making the choices who fall into like a separate category from the - the population at large.
