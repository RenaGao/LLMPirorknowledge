Uh, I got to - uh, my family is - had rarely go to the restaurant because we just, uh, make ourselves the food at our home, but is had only one time that we go to MK restaurant.  It's - I really, uh, surprised because my mom didn't want to go to eat in restaurant because it's really expensive but she gives me the XXX   because I don't know what I do to her but I really, really surprised and really get, uh, appreciated.  And it's a really amazing experience that I - I can go to MK restaurant with my mom.
I like Korean restaurant.
Yes, because, uh, Korean spicy is not really spicy as the same in the Thai.  And I like Kimbap very much, and I think, uh, XXX   traditional of Korea is very delicious.
Yes, I really agree because smoke is probably the - it is a bad thing.  I think they don't have the place to eat and smoke together.  If they have to smoke, they just go outside the place that, uh, maybe the some family will go to eat and the smoke will destroy their time.
