Yes.
Uh, good memory?
Um, like I think it was last summer I went to this seafood restaurant with my friend, and it was really expensive one like not ones that I go to every day.
So, from there we have really good time ever had went to this expensive restaurants by ourselves like with our parents XXX  others.
But that was XXX  for me.
Uh, which I like the best.  
I - well, it changes every time but now I like Chinese restaurant.  Like recently I really went to Chinese food.  
I don't like completely need like no smoking zone.  
So, right now we are allowing to have smoking basically but not outside.  
It's just inside like private.  
So, uh, I really haven't had any trouble with smoke in restaurants.  
Smoke inside the restaurant.  Most restaurants didn't have any smoking.
Kind of hard to me think about it.  
And I think - I think if they find prohibit because it seems like it's prohibited already to me, yeah.
