Okay, a few weeks ago, there was a boy, uh, who wanted to go for surfing, but he came to know that he had no money for that, then he thought that maybe he should start some kind of business in order to get money to go for some kind of, uh, this activity.  Um, and then he started a business.
He got the money and finally he went for surfing.
