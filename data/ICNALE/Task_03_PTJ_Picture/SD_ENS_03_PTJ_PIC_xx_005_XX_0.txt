All right, so a few weeks ago, a student who was very interested in going to the ocean, he wanted to go swimming.
But he did not have any money unfortunately; however, he stumbled upon a - a job application poster that a - a store was looking for staff members.  So he got a job and he was selling electronics and computers.
Then he was able to get money and then he was able to go on his trip to the ocean.
