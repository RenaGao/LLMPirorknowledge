Um, a few weeks ago, uh, a boy, he wants to go surfing and maybe, he wants to go swimming in the sea.  But he realized that he did not have enough money to buy a, uh, maybe traveling money or, uh, buy stuff to go surfing.  And then, when he passed by a store, he saw a staff-wanted announcement on the window.  So, he went to - uh, so he got the part-time job and it seems like he sold the laptops to the customers very successful and smoothly.  So, finally, he got the, uh, part-time job money and, yeah, and - and finally, he could go out with his friends.
