A few weeks ago, uh, made up his mind to go for some picnic but soon he realized that he is broke so he needs to first - he needed to get some money, so he - he saw - but he was, you can say, mm, jobless, perhaps that why he was broke so---
---but he saw a, you can say, a advertisement that 'Staff wanted' it says and he discussed perhaps with her - with someone with whom he had acquaintances, so perhaps he take advice that whether he should go for this job or not.
But suddenly, I guess, he opted this option that he - and he availed this option and - or he might have joined the - where the job was required and soon after perhaps at the end of the month, he got money and he utilized this money and went to the picnic.
