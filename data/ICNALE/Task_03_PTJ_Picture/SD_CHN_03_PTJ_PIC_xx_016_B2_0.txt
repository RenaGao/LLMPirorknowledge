A few weeks ago, Jackson came, um, has idea.  The idea came out to his mind that he could organize a great trip with, uh, with his wife and his little son in the sea, playing and maybe he gets some, get a - get the - get him tanned because the weather there will be great.  And then - then he came to realize that he got no money, not enough money.  And then he just came across a, uh, came across a building and he saw a poster talking about staff wanted.  Maybe, he could sell something for the money he needed for the trip.  And then he go to a - he go to a store and then he - he tell the employer that he want a job in the store and the employer said he could know this job and then tell he could work here.  Well, so a few weeks - so a few weeks of hard work, he got enough money and then he could - he successfully organized this trip with his wife and his little boy, and then go play in a - ah, in the sea, yeah.
