A few weeks ago, a boy went on beach to surf but he - after surfing, he suddenly realized that his wallet got wet and he obviously needed some money to buy some stuff but - and he went to a shop to talk to a person about a computer in order to receive his moneygram or some other source from which he could receive his money.  And after that, he received some money with which he bought some things that he required for surfing, and at the end, he went to surfing.
