Okay.  A few weeks a boy - a few weeks ago, there was a young boy that has a - umm - beach-outing for the next - for the next few days.  However, he doesn't have enough money to suffice the needs or the needs of expenses during that umm, outing.  And then, while working in the streets he saw a advertisement that are in need of staff and he tried to apply and work for that kind of job.  And, luckily he got a job and had that enough money to suffice those needs, for expenses and then, he went to the outing and he enjoyed the beach for that money.
