A few weeks ago Billy was thinking about taking a holiday or a vacation, swimming and surfing at a beach some place.  But he found out that he didn't have enough money in order to take a trip.  So he was walking, kind of, despondent and he saw an ad for a - a job.  He went in and applied for the job and was fortunate enough to get the job.  He got a paycheck and in - in a short time he was able to afford a vacation and was able to enjoy his life.
