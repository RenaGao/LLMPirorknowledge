A few weeks ago, there was a young little boy who was very much attracted to the beach; however, he couldn't afford a surfboard, and he wanted to go with somebody he liked.  However, he didn't have enough money.  Oh, sorry, am I supposed to mention the numbers?
So, he - he - he didn't have enough money to travel to where he needed to go and do the things he wanted.  So, he decided to find a job that he was interested in.  He knew he was intelligent.  He knew he was good with computers and with helping people over the net.  And then one day, he saw an advertisement, staff wanted in a computer store.  He was very interested in it and he went for an interview.  Next thing you know, he landed himself the job, acquired the cash, and was able to spend his summer days down at the beach with the girl he liked, perhaps it was even his sister.
