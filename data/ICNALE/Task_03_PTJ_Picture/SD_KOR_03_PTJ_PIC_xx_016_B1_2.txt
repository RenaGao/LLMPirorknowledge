So, a few weeks ago---
---uh, the man who is wearing a yellow or orange shirt went to - want to go, uh - was thinking to go, uh, beach with friends to do a surf or enjoy their beach life.
But he, uh, realized that he don't have any money to enjoy that.
So - and accidentally he - when he was - he was walking on the street, he saw a - a poster.
That indicates somebody needs, uh - some kind of, uh, electronic devices.
Yeah, so he decided to sell his, uh, washing machine.
So he - I think he negotiated quite well.
So, in picture 5, I can see that he is, uh, counting his money.
Which seems quite a lot.
So, uh, using that money, he can enjoy his, uh, trip to beach with his friend.  Yeah.
