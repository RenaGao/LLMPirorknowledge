A few weeks ago, a boy I know he - he thought he wanted to go swimming for his vacation.  But he - he realized that he has no money for it.  So, uh - and - and few days later he saw a poster on the wall by chance.  Uh, he thought he could get a job for money.  So, he got the job like part-time job and that job was like selling computer like.  So, he did well.  So, he got some like quite good money for the vacation and he went to the vacation and enjoyed his summer.
