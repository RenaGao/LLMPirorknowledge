Okay.    Um, uh - a few weeks ago, I wanted to go to the beach, but then I realized I had no money and I also wanted to buy something for staff at work.  So, I decided to - to have my, um, washing machine bought.  Later, someone wanted to - to buy my thing.  So, I have some money to go to the beach.
