A few weeks ago, there was a boy dreaming about something and but the problem is he does not have any capability to buy the thing that he always wanted to.  And there was really a lot of things that he want to buy.  And one day, he saw a laptop and he told her mother that he want that laptop.  But and her mother really gave him the money to buy the laptop and he was very happy because of tha because of that money because of that money, he was able to buy the laptop.  That's it sir.
