Okay, so, a few weeks ago there was this guy.  He was a - a college student, a freshman.  He recently got accepted in like the most prestigious university in his hometown.  So, well, it was during his semester break and he wanted to go on a vacation with his friends.  He wanted to like go in - to the beach enjoying the ocean breeze and that kind of stuff.  And the problem was he didn't have any money and he didn't have the heart to ask his parents for more pocket money because like his - his tuition was very, very expensive and his parents practically spend all of their money on his education.  So, he - he tried to think and think and then got an idea, why didn't he go and find like a job?  Well, it was during holiday and he got some time off, he got free time.  And then when he was walking at the mall well, he saw like an - an advertisement, like a poster on the window of a store.  Well, it was an electronic store and it said that it needed staff, new staff.  So, without thinking twice he applied and then he went to the interviews and like well the job - job interviews like the kind of stuffs, and he then got accepted.  He was very, very happy because uh he - he thought to himself and he will work so hard so that he could get money and he could go to vacation with his friends.  So, he started - he started his work like on Monday and then he - he like tries to sell the electronic things like computers, tablets, cellphones, televisions, to the customers and well, he - he had got it perfectly well because he's got the skill to persuade people so like he then get - got it acknowledged by his boss and then at the end of his job he was given like a bunch of money, it's like beyond his expectation with bonuses.  And because he had done so great in his job, so he got what he wanted and then at the end of the year, at the end of this semester break he went to the vacation with his friends.
