A few weeks ago a guy once wants - wanted to go to the beach but he had no money.  So, uh, then when he walked the street he found uh, a - a pamphlet written staff wanted.  It is like a fan, computers, or wardrobe, etcetera.  And then he has - he had idea to - to sell his laptop.  So from that laptop selling he got the money.  So now he can go to the beach and play with the other people.
