All right.  A few weeks ago someone - someone wanted to go and wanted to go by the sea and swim.  However, when he checked his wallet there is no money for him to go to the place that he wanted.
So, he went to a mall and then he saw ah, ah, job, he saw a paper that contained staff wanted which mean the, ah, shop wanted a staff.  So, he worked there and then he earned money.  So, after he earned the money he went with his friends to go to the sea and have a vacation.
That's all.
