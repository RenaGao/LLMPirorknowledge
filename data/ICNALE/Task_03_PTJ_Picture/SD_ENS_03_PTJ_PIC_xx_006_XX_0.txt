Oh, excuse me, okay.  Uhm, a few weeks ago, a young man was thinking about going on a trip out to the ocean, ,uh, but he realize that he didn't have - have any money.  So he decided to look for a part-time job.  He worked at his part-time job and saved up enough money and was able to go to the beach and the sea with his friends.
