A young man, okay.  Well, let me figure this out.  A few weeks ago, a man was surfing and he lost his wallet of money, so he - he went to look for a job and he saw a sign which says, staff wanted.  And he got a job offer doing - uh, I think it's a computer - oh, selling stuff like electronic stuff.  So he is trying to explain about computers or appliances and the customer is listening to his explanation.
Later on, after work or maybe after few months, he got his pay - paycheck, he got his salary and he got paid and very happy to make the money.  So he went back to the beach and in - with his family I guess, and swimming and enjoying his life.
