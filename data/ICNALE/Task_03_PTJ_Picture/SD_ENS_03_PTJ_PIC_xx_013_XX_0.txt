A few weeks ago a young man was dreaming about going snowboarding or going surfing in the ocean.  However unfortunately he didn't have enough money to afford the - the gear to buy snow - um, surfboard and surfing equipment.  Um, so he was depressed.  One day he stumbled across a 'Staff Wanted' sign at a shop and he had decided to take the opportunity.  The staff explained that he would be selling computers.  He got the job.  He got his first salary and he achieved his dream of going surfing in the beach with his friends.
