Okay, uh.  A few weeks ago, the boy in the picture seems to dream to go to a holiday - a vacation, maybe in an island, but, uh, he does not have the money to do so, and, umm, he found a advertisement that shows a staff wanted for maybe a company or a shop.  So, from there he work at the place to get the money that he need for the vacation.  So after working he finally got the money and he may need to go to the holiday, to the place that he wanted to go.
