A few weeks ago, this person in orange wanted to have - wanted to go swimming.  So I guess, in some sort of vacation.  And - but this person doesn't have a lot of money.  Um, for what I see, this person saw a poster of a job application interview where this - this establishment wanted to have some staff.  And uh, afterwards, this person started working and it seems that this - uh, this establishment is selling a bunch of laptops so I guess he is working in sales I guess.  And then - uh, and then this person uh, work until he gain - until he gained enough money to uh, get his uh, vacation I guess.  That's all.
