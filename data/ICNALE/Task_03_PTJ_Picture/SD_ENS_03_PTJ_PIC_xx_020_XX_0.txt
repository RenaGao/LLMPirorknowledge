A few weeks ago, John was thinking about how much he would like to go on a trip to Hawaii because he really likes swimming, but then he realized as much as he wanted to go, he didn't have enough money, so he was trying to find a way to make money and he came across a - an advertisement for staff wanted at an electronic store, so he thought it would be a great idea to get a job so he could save money in order to go on his holiday.  He started working at the store and he seemed to enjoy selling products to customers.  He always had a big smile on his face.  And the next month he received his first paycheck.  He was very happy, and several months after that, after saving some money, he was able to go on his holiday and enjoy swimming in the ocean.
