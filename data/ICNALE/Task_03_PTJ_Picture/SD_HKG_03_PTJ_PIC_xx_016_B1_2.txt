Okay.  A few weeks ago, Tom read a advertisement on a holiday to Hawaii and he wants to go to the, uh, Hawaii for some kind of swimming and to chill himself.  So, he planned to go to a holiday.  Well, he found that he has no money because he hasn't applied for any job.  So, he went for it.  He saw an advertisement on selling electronic appliances, uh, as a seller in the shop.  So, he applied and he successfully passed the interview and become a seller in the shop.  During the, uh - during his, uh, work period he sells several computers to customers and customers are satisfied with his performance.  So, he got paid.  And he fulfilled his dream of going to Hawaii.  The end.
