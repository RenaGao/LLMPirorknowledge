Okay.  So, um, a few weeks ago, a boy, he is planning to go for a holiday to some, uh, place with the beach, the sun and all sorts of things like that.  So, it's probably Thailand but then he doesn't have much money, so he wanted to earn some money through, uh, working part-time.  And so, uh, one day he saw a poster on the street saying that company is looking for some, uh, part-time workers, so he went to interview and then he got the job.  And then, uh - so he got the job and then he earned the money and eventually he got enough money to fly to Thailand or wherever he was planning to go.
