Um, okay.  Okay.  Uh, a few weeks ago, there is a man or a guy that is imaging of his vacation.  Then sadly, he does not have the enough funds for that vacation.  Then as he roams around outside, he saw an opportunity that there is a store that needs a staff.  He took that opportunity and worked at that store.  He worked hard and earned money until he managed to earn enough funds for his vacation.
