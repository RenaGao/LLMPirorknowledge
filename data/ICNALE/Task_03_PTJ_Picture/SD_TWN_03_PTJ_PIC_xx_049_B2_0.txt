Okay, a few days ago, a man, uh, wanted to go swimming and he found that, uh, he didn't have much money.  And one day, when he walked on the street, he - uh, he found a staff-wanted and then, he applied for that part-time job.  And then, for his job, he sell the computer to customers and - and then, few days later, he got, uh, his first salary and then he - and then, he was able to go swimming.  Yes, that's all.
