Because - uh, because he thought it's so hot and - but unfortunately he find that he didn't have enough money to pay the ticket price and - and when he - on the way to school he found that - he found staff wanted on the wall and then he thought he had a choice to earn much money.  Then, he went to the - uh, then he went to the company and try to have interview.  Fortunately, he passed and then he became a salesman in here - uh, there and, uh, his work is to sell computers to different people.
And after - after a long time he finished his work and he got enough money to go swim.  Finally, he asked many of his friends to go swimming with him.
