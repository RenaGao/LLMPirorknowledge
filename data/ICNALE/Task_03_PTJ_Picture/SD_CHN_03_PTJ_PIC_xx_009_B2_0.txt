A few weeks ago, a man wanted to have his summer vacation a month later, so - so he planned a lot for his holidays, but he found that he had no money in his pocket. So, he wanted to find some ways to gain more money for this holiday.  And then he looked - uh, uh, he found a staff wanted advertisement on wall, and especially for some fans or televisions or wardrobes, etcetera.  And then he went to the - went to the used store for more information and the staff so that he could - uh, he could, uh, get - uh, get money from his used computers.  So, he bought - uh, he - he - he brought his computer to the store and he got a lot of money for his vacation, and - and in the end, he and his friends had a very happy vacation near the ocean.
