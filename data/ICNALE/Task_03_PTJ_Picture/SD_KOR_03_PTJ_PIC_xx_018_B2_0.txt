Okay.  A few weeks ago, a man planned to go to the beach with his friend.
And he realized that he didn't have enough money to go to the beach and next day, he saw staff wanted - wanted paper on - on the window.
So, he worked as a staff at the shop and he steadily worked in maximum 1 month, he get paid enough money to go to the beach and finally, he went to the beach with his friend and had - and had a nice day.
