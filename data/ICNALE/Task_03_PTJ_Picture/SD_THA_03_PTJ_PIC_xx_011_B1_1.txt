A few weeks ago, the - the - the boy in this picture, he, uh - he think about have, uh, some vacation, maybe, uh, at the beach, he want to swimming.  But unfortunately, he - he don't have enough money.  So, he was so sad in that time.  And then, uh, he saw that, uh, advertisement, uh, about, uh, asking for staff.  So, he decide to apply it and then he work there, uh, until, uh, and then he get, uh, some salary.  So, now he have enough money to go to travel and in the last picture, he - he - he - he - he had this money to go - to - to go travel and swimming like here and complete his dreamland.
