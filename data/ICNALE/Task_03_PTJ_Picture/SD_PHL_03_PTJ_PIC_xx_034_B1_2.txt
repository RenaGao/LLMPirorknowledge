Okay.  A few weeks ago, there is a boy who wanted to umm go swimming in the beach and then he realized that he doesn't have enough money.  And so while he was walking, he saw this poster that says that the store needs someone who is willing to be a staff.  And so he he accepted the offer and the offer was to sell a laptop.  And when he got home, he has this money and so ah he was able to go swimming in the beach with his friends.
