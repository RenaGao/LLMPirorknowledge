Sure.  A few weeks ago a young boy thought of going on holiday.  He wanted to do watersports etcetera in a warmer climate.  When he checked his funds he found that his funds were lacking, which meant he couldn't go on holiday.  He then saw a - an advertisement for a part-time job and thought if he were to get a job he could raise the funds to go on holiday.  He applies successfully for the job and worked at it until he was able to take home his first paycheck or however many paychecks, and finally he was able to go on the holiday that he wanted to.
