Okay.  A few weeks ago, a man dreamed about a vacation which is at the beach and thinking that he would like to swim or surf.  Then in the second picture, it seems just as if he doesn't have enough money to go to that dream vacation and with that, he saw a bulletin that says that there is uh, a job application that he can go to and with that, he applied and earned money from it.  Afterwards, he then enjoyed his dream vacation.
