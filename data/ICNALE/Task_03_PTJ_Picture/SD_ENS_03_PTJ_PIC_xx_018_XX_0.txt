So, a few weeks ago, a man, he was out of money, so he decided, hmm, I need to go look for a job, and he saw an ad and they needed staff there, so he - he applied and then he got the job.  So, I think based on this he - he works as a customer service, like he - at a - at a shop, like he assists people, explaining different kinds of products to people.  And then after working there, this man, he got paid like a good amount of money, and he's like, oh, now I have money, I can go have fun, and he's like, oh why don't I invite my friends to swim.  You know, it's - it's the summer, it's nice weather.  So he went out to swim with his friends, and they had a really nice day.
