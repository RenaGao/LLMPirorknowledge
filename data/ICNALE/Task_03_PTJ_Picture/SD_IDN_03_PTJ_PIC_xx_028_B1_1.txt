A few weeks ago there's a friend of mine.  He's a young adult and he wants to go on vacation.  He likes to swimming and sun tanning in a beach.  Unfortunately he did not have any money that time.  He's confusing and stressing over it.  Then when he - when he walk on the city and the city square, he watch, he - he saw an advertisement which, which told him about hiring - a store - an electronic store hiring staff.  Then he applied to the job.  He applied to the job.  Then he did a great - he done a great - a great job for he can sell many, many products within this store.  And the manager of the store very fond of him to the point of he gets many bonus for - for his salary.  At the end of the month then he just, just use the - just use the money and spent it on the transportation to the - to the beach and any accommodation and his needs on - on his vacation.
