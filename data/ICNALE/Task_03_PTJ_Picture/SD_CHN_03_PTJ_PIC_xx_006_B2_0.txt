Okay.  A few weeks ago - let's say, Tom - Tom went to swimming in a open sea, and unfortunately, he lost his money and - but he - and when he realized that, he put the notice on the lost and found board and some - oh, he doesn't loss his money.  I am sorry.  I will again start from the second picture.  And - but he - he wants to travel maybe and he doesn't - he realized he doesn't have the money so accidentally he just saw a advertisement or notice about the staff wanted and he decided to - to apply for that job to get money.  And then he went - and then he went to do the part-time job, and he works as a sale assistant in a computer shop I think, electronic devices shop.  And then, uh - and then maybe after 1 month, he finally got his money.  Then he - he - he - he - he - he gets the enough money to go travel with his friends, with his family.
