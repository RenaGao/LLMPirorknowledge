He wanted to go to the beach but he was - he had no money, he was bankrupt, so when he was walking, he saw a pamphlet that shows like 'Staff wanted' so he just applied for it.  Then, he was working at the workplace and he was, well - had been complimented and at last, he got his money, well, the salary.  Then, he went to the beach with his friends.
