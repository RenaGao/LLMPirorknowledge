A few weeks ago, a man is really - a man has the thought of, uh, having fun in the sea, but, uh, he wants to learn swimming and play in the water with people, but however he doesn't have enough money to have the opportunity to learn swim and also play with others in the sea.  And one day he saw a post, it's about, um, uh, cruising staff to be the swimming shop customer, swimming shop seller, then he applied for the job and succeeded, then - oh, no, it's about another post.  Okay, then he saw a - a post and he apply for the job.  The job is about selling like computer, fans or refrigerator and so he makes money, so he finally had the money to swim at a sea.  Yeah.
