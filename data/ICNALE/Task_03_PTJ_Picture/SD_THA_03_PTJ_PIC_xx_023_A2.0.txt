Okay.  A few weeks ago, uh, uh, one boy thought of, uh, swimming.  He - he wants to swim in the sea and but he have no - he has no money.  He looked - he looked at a 'Staff wanted' XXX   it's - it's, uh, picture on the wall that tells about staff wanted.  It's, uh, uh about, uh, sell - selling things, yeah, and he took his notebook to someone and sell it, and he got money.  So, then he can go to sea - go to the sea and swim in it happily.
