A few weeks ago the boy think of - thought of that he wants to go swimming in a beach, so but he got no money, um, maybe he think that the transportation fee or the entrance fee is very expensives for him so he went for - he was looking for a job and he saw that on a street - shopping window or something like that so.  Uh, he called an interview I think then he became the employee of a electroning   shop, selling, uh, computer, fans, electronic applicants  .  So, yeah, I think he is successful, uh, selling the products to the customers, so he get pay and with a lot of money so he can go swimming - he could go swimming with his friends, yes.
