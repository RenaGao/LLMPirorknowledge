A few weeks ago, a boy want to, uh, go with, uh, her  - with his friends to a swimming pool.  But he don't have money to go with that - uh, to go in that place.  So, he wanted to sell his stuff like, uh, which he uses personally, the laptop or mobile phone.  So, he, uh, sell those, uh, his, uh, equipments and, uh, uh, get the money and then he go with all his friends at that place.
