Okay, so a few weeks ago, a boy really wanted to go to swimming in a beach because it's summer time and swimming like seems a lot of fun.  But he had - he had one problem that he didn't have money to go to the beach and to buy some drinks and everything else that we do in, we do in a beach.  So, like he, he, he was wandering around the town.  And then, he found out that a small shop in town needed some more new staff to help.  And then he tried to apply to do - to that small shop to earn the job and then he got it.  He got the job and the job was in an electronic shop to sell some electronic stuffs.  And then after he did a couple of weeks of that small shop job uh, he got the money that he earned.  So, he used the money to go to the beach with his friends and do some fun in summertime and then, yeah, like he had a lot of fun that summer.
