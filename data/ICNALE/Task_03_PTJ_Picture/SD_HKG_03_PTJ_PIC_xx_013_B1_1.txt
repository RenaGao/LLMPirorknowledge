A few weeks ago, I have saw my friends they have posts - some post in Facebook and they have went to the beach of - like they have went to - most of them have went to different place for their trip also.  And for now it's like summer and I would like to go to do - go to the beach also and I would like to go to like Okinawa, those places to feel that's beautiful sea.  But however I was - I do not have enough pocket money from - for me to go for a trip.  And while I was thinking how can I gain more money and to - for preparing for myself to go for a trip, I have - I have saw a recruitment in - in downstair of my - of my living building.  Then, I have wenst   to the interview of it.  And it soon employ me and from that - from that on I have worked hardly, and I almost worked for like 5 days every - each - every week, and I have worked for like 2 months.  And at last I have received my salary and I could go to - I could go to Okinawa by the money which I had gained by myself.  And it was a very nice experience.
