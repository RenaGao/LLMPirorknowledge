A few weeks ago, a boy went to a public pool, swimming pool and he saw kids enjoying in the water, so he - he too wanted to join them, but he did not have enough money to pay for the, you know, the charges, they, uh, asked you to pay to be a part of that swimming pool.  So, he went to a shop, uh, an electronic shop where a staff was needed.  So, he thought that if he worked there, he could earn some money to pay for the swimming pool.  So, he worked there for some days and with the money that he earned there, he was finally able to join and have fun over there with the kids at swimming pool.
