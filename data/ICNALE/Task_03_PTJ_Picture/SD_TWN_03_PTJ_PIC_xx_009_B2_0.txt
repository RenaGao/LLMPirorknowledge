Okay.  A few weeks ago Sam thought of going to this - going to the sea, going to the ocean, going to seaside.
To go, have some fun.
But when he opens his wallet he discovered that he doesn't have enough money and one day he went on the road - he went on the streets and saw a poster that said, "staff wanted."  Then, that makes him very excited.
And he went to the shop and become the staff.
After a month he got his salary and---
And now he can go to the sea - go to - go to the seaside.
And play with his friends.
The end.
