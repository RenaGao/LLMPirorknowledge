A few weeks ago, there was a boy and, uh, he thinks about, uh, picnic party that, uh, he would, uh, go for a picnic and, uh, in first picture we, uh, see that he was thinking about the - thinking about that he would rather go on a picnic and then we see that he was sad because he didn't have something to pay, uh, to go for a picnic.
Then, he - then he, uh, view a poster that, uh, it shows that there is something that other people wanted and he want to, uh - they want to purchase those things and he got a laptop and he sell that laptop to a female and then he - with his friends or with his family go for a picnic.  That's all.
