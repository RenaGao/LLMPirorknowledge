Okay.  So, there is six pictures, and the first picture is about the boys, I think he was dreaming of his summers, and he want to go on a vacation on seeing he like - maybe he like to swim.  But the second picture say that he didn't have - he don't have any - he doesn't have any money or saving money and don't have enough money to go on vacations.  The third picture say that he found - uh, he found out that it is - there is a staff wanted on the shop, maybe - maybe on the electro - electronic shops for the - for the houses, and then he register for that and - after he get a job - he got a job, he become a saleman as a part-time.  He sells a lot of electronic things, for example, like notebook or something like that to foreigner or people, and he get a lot of money.  That's why in the futures, he get a lot of, uh, salary - a lot of money, and gets his salary plus bonus because he seemed to work pretty well with his job, and the last picture about he go to, uh - he go to the place he was dreaming.  He achieved his dream.
