Uh, a few weeks ago, I decided to - uh, I decided I want to go to the sea, but I - it remind me something that I got no money.  So, I decided to find a part-time job at our counter stores and my responsibility is, uh, to take care of the customer and I thought that I did - my job is very good, so - and then a few weeks later, I got money from this part-time job, and I spent those money with my - uh, my holiday at an island.
