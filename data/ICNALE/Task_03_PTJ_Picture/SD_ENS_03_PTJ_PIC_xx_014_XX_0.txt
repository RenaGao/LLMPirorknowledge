All right.  A few weeks ago, a boy wanted to go to the beach for summer vacation but he didn't have any money.  So - so he couldn't go.  Then he saw a part-time job where he can make that money and decided to work that part-time job.  Once he got the money, enough money for his trip, he went to the beach with his friends.
