Okay.  A few weeks ago, a man was planning to go to a beach strip, uh, and swim although he didn't have enough funds to uh, plan that trip.  So the man uh, checked everywhere to find uh, uh, where he can get his funds.  So he stopped and saw a staff wanted uh, poster and applied for the position as a staff in an electronics company where he sold - where he sold uh, laptops.  And uh, as soon as he sold his - he got his first uh, sale, he got his money and after that - after he got his money, he was able to uh, to go to this beach strip.
