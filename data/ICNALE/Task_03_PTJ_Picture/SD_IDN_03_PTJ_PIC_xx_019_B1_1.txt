A few weeks ago there is a boy who wants to - want to go at beach.  But unfortunate - unfortunately, he didn't have money for go   to the beach.  And then he found a job to earn money and then he worked at the sales - sales - he worked there at sales to sell computer and another electronic stuff.  And then he earned money from his jobs and then he can - he could go to the beach with the money he earned.  Thank you.
