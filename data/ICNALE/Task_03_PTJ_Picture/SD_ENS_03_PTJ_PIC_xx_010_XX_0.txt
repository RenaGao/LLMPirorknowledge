Oh, a few - a few weeks ago a man thought he wanted to go surfing, but he had no money. Whilst working on the street one day he saw a sign looking for staff at an electronic store.  He managed to get a job with this company and earned some money.  In the end him and his friends got to go surfing and swimming in the ocean.
