That - it means past?  A, uh, boy want - wanted to go to swimming. 
And he want to go to vacation but he doesn't have - he didn't have money so he saw, um, like - he wants to - uh, he saw a post that says 'Staff wanted'.
So, he started to sell a computer.
For his job - part-time job I - I think.
And he got some money.
So, he could go to the vacation and he could - he played with his friends.
