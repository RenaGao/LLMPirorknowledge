Okay.  A few weeks ago, I - I plan to go to, uh, the beach, but I don't have no money.  So, I think that I can't go if I have no money.  I - I decided to go to have some job - some free - free time job, uh, I decided to do it.  Uh, I admit to do the job and then after the job, I get some money, and it is enough to - enough for me to go to my vacation time and then I try to invite my friend and we go to there together.
