Um, a few weeks ago, uh, a boy had an idea of swimming in a sea, but then he realized that he didn't have enough money to do so because, uh, he needed admission fee when he wanted to swim but he just didn't have enough money.  Then one day when he passed by a street then he found that there is a recruitment advertisement, which is about selling different kinds of electronic appliances, then he applied for it and started to sell computers and laptops to different customers.  And finally he got, uh, his own money and then he is - he was able to swim with his friends, I guess, yeah.  That's it.
