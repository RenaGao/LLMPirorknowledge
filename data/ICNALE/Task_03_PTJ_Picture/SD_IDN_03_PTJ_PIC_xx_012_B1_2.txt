Okay.  So, a few weeks ago the boy thinking about having a vacation in the beach where he can swim, he can surf, and he can sunbathing   all day with all of his friend.  But he realized that it's the end of the month, so when he check his pocket he actually have   no money left.  So, he is thinking about how can he get money.  So, he walk around the city, he saw a poster about job vacancy which is about selling the electronic goods.  And then he applied to the job and he got accepted.  And then he works for it about for around 1 month and then he got his first salary, then he goes straight into the beach with his friend using his salary to go swimming, sunbathing and surfing.
