Um, okay.  It's just a storytelling about a guy.  So, a few weeks ago, this guy called - let's say he is, um, Charles, um, he wanted to go to swimming during the summer with his friends, but then he is also in a state of unemployment where he doesn't have money to do so.  So, what instead of have passively staying at home he actually go out and seek a job and he found a job to sell computers to others where, um, like just a few days ago he received his first salary.  And so now he has the ability and, uh, the money, support for him to go out and, uh, have fun with his friends.
