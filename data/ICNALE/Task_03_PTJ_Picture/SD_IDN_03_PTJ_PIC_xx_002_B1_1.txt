A few weeks ago a man thought that holiday is very important for his life.
Because he needs refreshing.
But he thinks that he didn't have money to go to holiday.  He didn't get enough money for his holiday.  So, when he walk somewhere, he found out that he, one of the - the shop needs a staff to do their job.  And after that this man applied for the job and did his job for - for like a month.  And then after he work for a little bit time, he got his salary and he go to the holiday after.  I think that's all.
