  Okay.  A few weeks ago there is a boy.  
He wanted to go to - go to - go to - go to beach.
Yeah and - but - but he didn't have much money--- 
---to - to do that.  So, one day he saw a - a - a opportunity and then he become a staff and sells some, um, um.
Sell like some computer.
And then he got the money and finally he could go to a beach and play with her friend - his friend.
