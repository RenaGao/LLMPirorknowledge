Okay.  A few weeks ago, um, Henry wants to go to beach to swimming and surfing because it's summer.  However, um, being a student he didn't have enough money to go on vacation.  So, one day when he was working   on the street, and he saw an advertisement said supermarket is hiring a staff.  So, he decided to interview.  And luckily he was hired.  So, he worked hard and boss thinks he is - he was really good.  So, the boss gave him his salary.  And Henry is really happy because he had enough money to go on vacation.  Therefore, he went to the beach with his friends and play happily.
