  a few weeks ago John wanted to go on a vacation at the beach and he - so he was planning on a vacation.  He didn't have enough money after checking his wallet I suppose and then after he - since he didn't have enough money he decided - he was walking around the mall I guess and then he saw a sign for a part-time job.  So he - looks like yeah, he - he applied for a job.  He started working there uhm, I guess for a couple of weeks then and then he earned enough money and then to fulfill his desire of going on a vacation.
