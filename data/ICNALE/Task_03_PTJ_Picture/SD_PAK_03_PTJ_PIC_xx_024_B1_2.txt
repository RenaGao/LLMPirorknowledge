Okay, uh, a few weeks ago, I think a person is drowning into a sea and he is, uh, trying for some help and nobody's over there.  Probably, it's a dream like situation.  He's in a dreamlike situation where he is swimming in a sea, probably drowning, so that's it in the picture 1.
Okay.
In sec - in next picture...
A boy is crying because he had some problem with - uh, with his dinner.  Probably, he's holding a burger that is sour, probably not eatable so he's weeping.
Yes, yes, yes.
...and there's nothing on - on the screen.  Uh, the elder guy is not looking good, so he is probably, uh, making some mistake because his laptop is not working on the time.  In the next picture...
Okay, okay.  Then, a boy is popping out some letters.  He's reading it out.  A girl is - probably, these letters are from a girl, probably her fiance, so he's not looking good.  Uh, probably she has rejected her.
She has rejected him and in the last picture again, there is a sea like situation.  Three kids, they are, as you know, dipping in on the snow - dipping in the water, probably they are enjoying.  So, first time in this picture a couple of kids, they are enjoying.
