A few weeks ago, there was a boy who wanted to enroll in swim.  Unfortunately, he was still young and presumably too young to start on his own and pay for the tutorial how to swim.  So instead, he found a job worthy of his, I mean, worthy of whatever he knows right back of his current age.  So he did a part-time job, he is probably a salesman by now and seems to be successful.  Now he got his first paycheck and his mother is proud.  He was now able to afford a swimming lesson.
