Okay, I'm trying to say it.  A few weeks ago, a boy, uh, namely Alan is planning to have a swim in a se - uh, in a sea of - with the - with the sun rising and, uh, releasing sun ray to him.  Uh, but he founds that he doesn't have enough money to do so, uh, when he look at his wallet.  And then, uh, but he look at a poster, an advertisement of recruiting people and which can help him to earn money to have a swim to do what he plans to do.  And afterwards he - he was success, uh - he succ - he successfully recruited as a waiter to serve people to earn a living, to do what he want to do - wants to do.  And, then, finally maybe after a month he earns a lot of money from his boss and then ultimately he can do what he plans to do, have a - have a swim with his friends, maybe his family as well.
