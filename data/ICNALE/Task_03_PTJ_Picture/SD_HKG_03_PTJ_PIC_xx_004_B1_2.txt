Hmm, a few weeks ago a boy wanted to go to an island or a - a sea to, uh, have a time to surf or to swim.  But he found out he didn't have enough money to pay for the trip.  So, he decided to, uh - he decided to go for a job and, um, he successed in the interview so he got the job and, um, maybe the job is about some comp - the job might be like promoting computers or electronic devices and, uh, then he got enough money for the trip so he went to, uh, have the swim and, uh, he went with his friends or he met friends there.  So they swam together at the end.
