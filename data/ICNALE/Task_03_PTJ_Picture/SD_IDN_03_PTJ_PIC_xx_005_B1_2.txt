Okay.  A few weeks ago there was a boy that she - he really wanted to take a swim in - in the sea but he didn't have money, so he decided to find some work.  And finally he found 'Staff wanted' on the wall.  He decided to be a part of the staff and he would get some fee.  And finally, he could go to swim because he had money.
