Okay, a few weeks ago, a boy was thinking about going on a trip on the beach, I think, but he does not - he didn't have enough money to afford the trip.  So, he was trying to find a job to earn money for that trip.  So, he got a job at a store.  And I think he was selling notebook in an electric city shop.  And he earned money for the trip and he eventually went to the trip.
