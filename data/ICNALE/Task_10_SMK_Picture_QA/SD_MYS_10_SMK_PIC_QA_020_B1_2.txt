When I was a kid, yeah.
Playing soccer.
Yeah.
My friends, because I don't really have a lot of girlfriends in my housing area so I always play with the boys.  And they only play soccer.
Every day.
Yeah.
After school.
Playing soccer.
Yeah.
I don't really have favorite park because I just go everywhere that has place - space for me to play.  And now when I'm older - okay, I'm young but - yeah, a little bit older for my age used to be, I used to take my nephew to the park so I think now it is near to my mom's house.
I think she is a strong lady to have the courage to approach the man and tell - tell him - tell him to stop.  But I don't really think that the mom has the courage at first because we can see in the picture that she was kind of worried to approach that guy like she - she did it after all because of her son.
Yeah, very much.  I would like to be someone like this in the future.
Um---
As - as my friend.
Um, because maybe I look at extroverted but I am introverted the inside.  So I need this kind of friend to - to - to speak up for me because I don't really have the courage actually.
Well, for me, um, when I was growing up, I got a lot of, um, skin disease due to playing in the ground and so on.  But for me it is the process of growing up.  So is the mother, um, or is there - themself - responsibilities to take care of themself wash their hands daily XXX   after - right after playing so that they won't get infected and all.
