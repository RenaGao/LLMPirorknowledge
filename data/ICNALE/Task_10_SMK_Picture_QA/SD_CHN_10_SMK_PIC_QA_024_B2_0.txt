I do.
I just sit there, watching other people.  I think---.
Just again makes - make me calm down.
In one month?  Well, maybe once a month.
I think it depends.
Wow.  ... Well, my favorite park actually is in my hometown.  It is called Beilin Park.  Well, it used to be the - a grave of an emperor, but now it's - it's only a park now.  It's not that scaring.  Well - and there are a lot of trees, like - and some other plants I - although I don't know their names, but well they are beautiful, especially in summer when - well and there are also some animals like - like birds and squirrels, which are very cute.
Yeah and the air, the most important part I think.  It has very clean air, which always make - make me feel comfortable and XXX  down.  So when I feel like unpleased or just frustrated, I - I like to go there.
I absolutely like this kind of women.
Well, because what she did is absolutely right.  Well, like she is alright.  Since she is right, well, I think she just supposed to speak it out rather than burying.
I do.
And actually my mother is just this - this type of woman.
I think it's partly right.
But in my opinion, if the child did not like - did not play with it and maybe - well - well just for - for instance, maybe he play with it and he got sick because - because of it and he will remember it and did not repeat it next time.  And I think this is the more important thing for a child, to learn and to like maybe get frustrated or maybe get some unpleasant experience and remember it and do not do it again.
