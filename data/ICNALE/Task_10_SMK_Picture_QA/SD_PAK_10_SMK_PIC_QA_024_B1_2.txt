Uh, not so often.
Because parks, you know, it - it - it makes you a fresh guy.  You feel the scenery, you feel grassy la - land - you enjoy over there, so you watch so many peoples.
And you simply - uh, this experience abbreviates your tensions.
Uh, I don't go.
Yes, I do have a favorite park in Sialkot...
Uh, the name of that park is Khayaban-e-Iqbal park.
It's - it's a family park.  There - there are - are not so many, as you know, uh, so many shops or so many uh, people.  Uh, it - it's simply a grassland.  Uh, there are so many trees.  There is a pool in fact, that is the hallmark of that park.  So, people used to enjoy over there.
Honestly speaking I give a damn to such type of lady because I like quiet and shy girls.  So...
Well, such type of lady, uh, can confine you for so many things like you - you can't eat these things, you can't do those - those works, so this and that.  That's why, such type of restrictions a guy like me probably, uh, can't tolerate.
Yes, obviously, he shouldn't be there, but in our country, uh, in Pakistan, there are not so many parks.  So, people are confined, they have to, uh, as you know, go over there and probably they have to waste some time over there.
