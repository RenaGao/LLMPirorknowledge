Um.
Uh, in my - in my child - when I am child I am going to park usually but, um, I don't think that as a - as a rather older adult - as a young adult specifically, um, I seldom going to park.
Um, no because there is a very few occasions that I will go to a park with others and by myself.
Um, a park, uh, the most, uh, the most - the park I remember most is actually the one, uh, where I - located where I lived.
Because it's very close, it's almost just you walk a little bit further and you can see the park, and where there are - there are often many ceremonies held, uh, there are many people.  There is a playing, uh, badminton and there are many elderlies sitting on chairs, uh, to talk with each other and - but that park is the one I have to - I have to always, uh, walking to because, uh, this is the on - that is the only way I go to school and I usually walk around, uh, yes, favorite park.
Um, yeah, I can see her eyes feels very strong.  Um, I think it's a little bit like my mother when she is angry, uh, but it is normal to do so because, uh, that man - when that man smoking, uh, he is causing harm to the child of that mother, so he is kind of doing something wrongly and so being criticized the - by that mother for his - his - um, his conduct, some - somewhat, uh, of smoking.  So that mother - the reason why that mother is very, uh, angry and trying to be strong to criticize that man is very usual to see, it's very common.
Um, I think the mother, uh, will - before the boy plays the sand in sandbox, uh, the mother should inform him about the, uh, health issues, uh, about the sandbox because, uh - because it will also cause ha - potentially cause harms to the chi - to children when they play for long time, uh, in their daily lives.  So, mother, uh - mothers of them actually has the response - have the responsibility to at least informing them or - or reminding them of the potential with that the sandbox causes to them, uh, especially the health one.
