Picture.
---based on the study.
I used to---
---not now.
Um---
Um, depends like if the - if the park is - if there is a lot of green in there, then that's okay for me.
Because of green.  Uh-huh.
Um, probably in the last few months, I went there for like 4 times.
Yeah, just for doing sports.
No, apparently not.  It's quite far away.
Yeah.
Uh, the park?
Uh, the park is very likely---
---there is not much people in there and there is not much construction and there is a lot of green in there, because you know we need oxygen because of it and I just having, you know, being a green person instead of those who are cutting down trees.
I pro - because I also love nature---
---if I go to some particular park.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, it's just the mother is only, you know, considering because there is a child---
---and her mother doesn't want for her child to be a passive smoker.  Neither her mother or herself does - don't want to be, you know, the passive smoker because smoking is just really bad.  Also it's just XXX .
Uh, um, I - I - I'm not only like this type of lady, I would be become this type of lady, I would be become someone who has told someone to stop smoking.
Uh---
Absolutely 100%.
I can give like 1000% because I can XXX .
I prefer my mother because---
---because family comes first.
Mm-hmm
Mm-hmm.
It's actually true because if you want to play in sandbox, there is a lot of child or a lot of people who already use - choose from somewhere else park or they already step on poo or step on someone's pee and just stepping the sands, so it's - it's not that clean.
