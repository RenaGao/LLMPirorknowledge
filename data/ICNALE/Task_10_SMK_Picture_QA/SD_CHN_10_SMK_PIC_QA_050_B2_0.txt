Yeah. 
Yes I often go - go to the park because I think this kind of park can make me unwind and reduce my stress from the work and study.
I usually go to the park with my family members or my friends because I can talk to them about my recent stories and experience to help me or release my stress.
I just, uh, walk with my family members or friends, talk to them, and enjoying the - the wonderful scene.
Well, once a week.
I always go to park near my home and it's very big park.  It has various trees and flowers and have very quiet air in this park.
Actually, I don't remember this park name. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just walk to this.
Worked  there?
Yes.
Like 5 to 10 minutes.
Yeah.
I think - I think it is very good behavior because in our society there are too many people that when they face this kind of situation they don't want to stand out to, uh, tell this man he was wrong, so I think it's very - uh, quite good behavior and I think - and she is very good role model for people to learn.
Mmm, I think it depends.  If, uh, this man is just a very strong when he face some unfair situation I think it is - I can get away with, um, he - with them, but he - if they always, uh, behave like this I don't think I can get well with them.
I think I am going to live very under - under pressure because it must be very, uh, strict for - uh, to me and asked me to do a lot of things maybe I don't want to do.
Mmm.
No, I think it depends because if the sandbox - because some sandbox are - are very clean nowadays.  But if this sandbag  - uh, sand is very - is not very clean, I will not allow my children to play in this kind of sandbox because I think it is kind of very easily to get some ill or get some diseases.  So, I won't allow my children to do - to go to this place.
Yeah.
