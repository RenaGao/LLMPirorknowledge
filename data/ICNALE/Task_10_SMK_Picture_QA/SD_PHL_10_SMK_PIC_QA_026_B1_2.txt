Yes.
Swing.
Now, I don't go to parks.  But when I was a kid - umm, maybe two times a day.
Umm, near our house - the park near our house is simple.  It has swings and slides but it is memorable to me because I have a lot of memories there with my childhood friends.
For me the mother did her part because she's just protecting her child and the - the man - the man the being criticized by her is really - deserve to be scolded because he's not aware that there is a child along that way.
I guess that its right that kids umm - should not play on the sandbox like this XXX   because it is bad that - that their health and umm - even if we say that he is with his mother umm, we cannot stop umm, bacterias to go over us.
