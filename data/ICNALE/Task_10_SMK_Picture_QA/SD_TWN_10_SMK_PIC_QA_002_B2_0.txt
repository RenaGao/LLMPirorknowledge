Yes.
Uh, I will play balls with my brother and father.
Uh, yes.
Um, in the park, we may play baseball.
Just throw and catch.
Um, because I live on the mountain, so uh  
Hmm.
Uh, in front of our house, there is a big, um, playground to play ball.  So - so I seldom go to the park.
Um, my favorite park is Daan Forest Park.
Um, because it is very, very big and there are so many different plants in there and animal, uh, like birds is very, very much.  And when I was in elementary school, every year, our teacher will - will take us to Daan, uh, Forest Park to have some, um---  
---Um, something like that, but---  
We will have some competition with other class, um, just like, uh, maybe RPG, just like that.  
And it's very fun.  So, I like Daan Forest Park very much.
Uh, I agree with that, because, um, the man look a little bit bad, but she can, um, directly talk to him and tell him to not smoke.
Um, because her son, hmm, is ill because the smoke and, hmm, all mothers will be very strong when meeting their children's need.
Yes.
Um, um, if I were a mother, I want to be that kind of lady, but if I were a girlfriend, I think, uh, that is a little bit too strong.
Hmm, because when you are a girlfriend, maybe you won't meet some situation like that and maybe it's your boyfriend's time to be that strong, not you.
Hmm, I think it is not clean---
---because many children play there and you don't know if that children is   clean and, um, the most disgusting thing I think is dogs and cats will, uh, pee there.
Um, but it is very interesting.  So, maybe I will let them play in the sandbox, but um, I will take them back to home and wash, uh, take a bath immediately.
