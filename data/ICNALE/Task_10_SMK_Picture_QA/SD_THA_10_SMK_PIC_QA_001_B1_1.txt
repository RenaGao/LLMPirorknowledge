Um, yes, I like going to the park, but not - not the playground, just the - the na - nature - more natural park.
Uh, I always go to the park to exercise, running.
Yes.
Maybe, uh---
One month.  Twelve days per - per month.
Yeah, three - three days a week.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It's not really a park.  It's just the - the place that like a park.  They call, uh, in the university people always call that sophomore or lo - lotus - lotus the---
Lotus lake, yeah.  They near the - it's near the, uh, faculty of medicine.  And people that work in at the nursing they live near that and they also go jogging, uh, in the - in that - in that place.
And I like - I like it pretty much because I - as I said I like the na - nature and--- 
---when I walk the across the tree maybe there are tree around the runway or walkway, yeah, I like that park.
Yes, in every morning.
Yes.
Uh, maybe, her doing the right thing, because if I smoke, I will - I will not smoke at the park or the place that is a lot of people that maybe a cause of cancer.
Uh, not really because it - uh, if I were that lady, I will not go to talk to him directly but I will maybe make some, uh, some situation that make him know that we don't like - we don't like the smoke.  We--- 
---we - we - we - we will have to stop them possibly.
Not - not really.
Yes.
Because I think is - she is too - too directly.  I - I mean---
Right, she always speak your mind--- 
Maybe she - she could - she could think more about - before they - before she talk.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah, I agree with this opinion because maybe all of the kids playing in the sandbox and if they found something that very - very bad or very, uh, disgusting and very unclean, they will get the - in some bacteria in the - in their body and that's not good to - that not very good to---
The kids.
