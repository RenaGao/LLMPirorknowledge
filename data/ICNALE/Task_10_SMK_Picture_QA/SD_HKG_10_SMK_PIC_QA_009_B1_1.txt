Um, I will do - do this when I am a little child but not do this right now.
Um, I will - I love the swing and because it's not common to have the sand in the park, so I will love to build the sand castle but it doesn't allow me to do so because I don't have a chance.
Um, I think because there is a park downstairs in my - where I live so I will pass through the park but I didn't really play there.
Um, I think maybe the Ma On Shan Plat   because like I lived there nearby and it's like the biggest park in - inside Ma On Shan and it's fun.
Um, I think she is right because, um, the man didn't consider other and he chose all of his own benefit and then because it's not good for children health and park is mainly for the - play the child so it's good for her to do that.  She is her - maybe she has been strong but it's still okay.
Uh-hmm, I think our - when we are in the public area, maybe, it's not really clean or something but after we go home, we can take a shower and then we can clean up, so it's okay to play there.
