Um, actually, I don't like going to park--- 
---because when I was young I - I already don't like to go to the park, I like to do something more - not that active I think.  I like to sit in the chair and drawing picture or do something, not moving, yeah.
Um, parks, is it, uh, Disneyland or the Ocean Park is a park, right?
Yeah, I've been to Ocean Park with my friend last month because that is her birthday so I own her to - so I bring her to the Ocean Park and for to celebrate.
Actually, I like to - I like the Universal - is it the Universal   - universal world in the, um - I'm not really remember the name in America.
Um, there is a very interesting park in the - in that park - in the - there is a very interesting part in the park - oh, this is very creepy - eh, because there is a Harry Potter film in the park and I can buy, uh, very interesting wood stick and try to play like a Harry Potter.
Hmm, I really like her because if she wants to do something, she - she shouldn't keep silence, she should tell others and besides actually he - the man shouldn't smoke in the park because maybe the policy or the law is actually banned smoking in the park.  If she remind him she can prevent him from being punished, yeah.
Uh, I have to - I have a very - because I know it is not clean but people go to the beach and the beach is also not clean, eh, and I think the kids is only need to washing hand after playing the sand.  I think that would be better because he - he won't eating food when he playing I think.  So that's okay I think.
