Um, I like going to the park when I was small.
Um, uh, sometimes go to the swings and, um, maybe like play XXX   volleyball.
No.
Because staying at home playing the computer is more fun to be now.
Um, my favorite park actually is as the XXX   because, um, when I was small I used to visit my grandmother who lived there and, um, I enjoyed playing at their playground there.
Um, I think this lady is great actually is brave enough to point out the - the action of the man is not so good in the playground, but, um, I think that if she is a mother she may be very serious or, um, maybe very, um - sometimes maybe quite harsh on the children when - maybe when they have some - made some mistakes.  But, um, overall I think that this kind of, um, people is great in the society.
Um, the sandboxes may be not so clean compared to other facilities but, um, it is not as - it is not - it is not so serious that the parents cannot let their children playing there.  I think that, um, that the children can play in there as long as they clean up themselves after playing.
