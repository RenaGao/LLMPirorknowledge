Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, I feel the environment is so good and the air is so fresh.
Oh, basically, I would just take a walk.
Recently?  I - basically I don't - I don't really go to park, so I guess maybe one month just once.
Okay.  Um, my favorite park is a park near my home in China.  Yeah, it's very big and because in city you can - those trees are not really very high.
And not that, um, extends, but in that park you can just see so many trees, bamboos, and flowers.  Yeah, you just feel you are surrounded by nature and that feels so good.
And there is a big lake, yeah.  Um, some old people are dancing there.  Yeah, it's very odd.  Yeah, and when you sit down - when you sit down there, maybe that's all people will talk to you and - and also it's very fun to communicating with other people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, I feel she is very kind to his little brother and when - when - when she thinks someone is doing wrong things, she will, um, talk to him.
I felt that's very good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, when - should - should not play what?
Yeah, um, I feel it's okay that it's dirty.  If it's dirty, you can just go back home and take a shower.  Yeah.  Wash your hands very quickly.  Yeah, that's very - that's not a big problem but if - um, with - with sand, you can make castle, you can make house.  It is so fun and also living in city, there is not really many chances to, um - to kind of play with nature, yeah, the sand.  Yeah, so I feel it's - it's fun and, um, through that, you can appreciate the nature.
