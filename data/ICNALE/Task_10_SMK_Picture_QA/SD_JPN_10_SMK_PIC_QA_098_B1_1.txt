In the past, I liked.
Hmmm, now?
Ah, when I go to park, I feel nature.
Recently I, I went to a park near Shukugawa.
Favorite park, anything is  
In Japan only?
Okay, my favorite park is Central Park in New York City.
In last summer, I went to New York for studying English and I also did sightseeing, then I went to Central Park for the first time.  It is too, so huge and beautiful.  Many people running or eating lunch.  It is very different from parks in Japan, my country.  Yeah, it is surprising and I - I feel, I felt comfortable in the park  .
Uh, I think it is good.
Yeah and I - I want to be this type of  .
It is difficult, but yeah.  A few minute, a few days ago, I went to - I through the park and the sand area was covered with cover and I asked from my mother why it is.  She answered it is no good sanitary because of cats.
So then I understand, I understood that situation and yeah, it is not good.  It is no good opinion because playing in a sand box is helpful for children to feel nature.
