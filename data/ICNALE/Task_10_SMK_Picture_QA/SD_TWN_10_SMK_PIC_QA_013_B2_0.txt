In 1 month.  Maybe, um - maybe two times
I just, um - I will take some snacks and I will, um, take a walk with my - my friends or my family.
Yes.
My favorite park is in - is---
Near - near my - my mom house.
It's - it's - it's very, very big.
And - and many trees.
And there is a plant.
So, many people will go there to have a picnic.
Not really.
Because I - I think she is, um, too - too - too angry.
And I think there is a better way to communicate with others.
Um, huh.
Like my mother.
Um, no my mother is not a strong lady.
No, I do not.
No.
Um, I think - um, I think we - we don't have to the so - so, um, how do you say that.
Strong, yeah.  And I mean we can do - do our best but we - we don't have to like, um, be strong to like make others felt a little stress.
I think it's - it's okay.

And it's not a big - big deal
