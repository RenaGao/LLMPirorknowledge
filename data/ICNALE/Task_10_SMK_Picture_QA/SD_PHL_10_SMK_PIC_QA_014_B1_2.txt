Ah.
Not much.
Ah, it's not, it's not my thing to go into the, in the park.
Ah, not too often.
Hmm, my favorite park is the Rizal Park, because for me, it's ah, it's in a historical place that ah, that kids should learn about, about its ah, how, how its name is etched to the history of the, of the country.
Ah, I think it's true, because maybe some kids ah, vomit on it, maybe peed on it also or maybe cats or dogs that also go in ah, go into the park freely ah maybe, it ah, have their poo in it or maybe peed on it.  So, I think it's not clean to go in the sandbox.
