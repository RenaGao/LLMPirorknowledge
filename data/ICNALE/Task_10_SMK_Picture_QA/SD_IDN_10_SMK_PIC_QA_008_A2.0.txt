Finished.
Uh yeah, sometimes.
I think chill with my friends and uh jogging sometimes.
In a month maybe twice a month.
Yes,
The park is not big, not - not small, it's just - just yeah standard.
Yeah.
Uh, near my college.
The park is near my college with uh trees.  Many, many trees there and the bench, so we can talk freely there and the jogging track, the jogging track around it so we can try to jogging around it.
Ah and the sunset is very, very good, very, very beautiful in there.  So, we try - we sometimes take to watch sunset there.
Uh-huh.
Maybe there is no playing ground at there because it not supposed to be playground for the child.
But there are some space too for animals like dogs and dogs can, I don't know, play there with a catch like that, with Frisbees like that and it fun.
Yes.
For me personally for mother.
Because uh the strong lady can build the manners better for - for their child, for their son, in this picture for their son.  So, yeah, she can be a good role model for their son.
For me, it's okay to child play in a sand  ---.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I disagree because it can build more immunity for the boy, for the children.  So, it doesn't matter since the woman can - can teach how to sanitize hand or body or anything in the son's body.  So...
It can be really helpful.
Okay.
