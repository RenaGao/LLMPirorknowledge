Yeah, I like going to the park.
Because when you are going to the park you can look - looking around---
---there and you just like see garden and also the people surround you and just like there is a playing something.
Jogging.
One month just like twice.
Yeah, near from my house.
Um the park is like uh it's not - there is a lake---
---near from the park.
It is not the bigger one but I guess that is the beautiful view.
And there is a jogging track in the park so it makes me comfortable to doing jogging and some in the center of the park there is a - like a place that the kids can playing around so like playing soccer, something like that.
Yeah
Uh-huh
Mother.
Because mother knows what the kids need.
Yeah.
Um like having fresh air.
Uh-huh
Yeah
Uh-huh
Yeah
Okay.
Uh I am disagree with that statement.
I guess the kids maybe uh- maybe the woman - the mother know that the garden is not clean enough for the kids playing arounds   there but I guess uh the kids - that the mother can tells   to the kids that the park is not good clean uh not clean good enough---
---but you can play arounds   but not often.
