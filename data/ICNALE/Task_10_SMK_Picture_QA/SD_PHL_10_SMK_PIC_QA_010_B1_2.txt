Yes.
Um, just communicating with my friends.
Recently - recently?
I am not - I am not able to go to the park recently because---  
Because sometimes there is uh, there is a lot of school work, so I don't have time for that.
Um, favorite park that I usually go is the park in our province because I - because that's the - that's the only park that I go because I - I go there with my friends, especially when I was in high school, we always go there after exams and just forget about the exam and then just communicate and have fun.
Can you repeat it again?
I like the - the type of lady in the picture because she is able to say what she wanted to say to other people without - without hesitating, especially when - when her child's health is at risk.
Maybe it's one - one factor why the child got sick.  Then we - we cannot say that - we cannot say that it's the only factor, maybe the - also the - maybe it also from the man who is smoking.
