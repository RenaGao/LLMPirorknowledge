Yes.
Yes.
Mmm, yes, I like to go into the park, but I, mm, seldom going - go to the park because I - I have - I don't have free time to go - go there.
Mmm, I just sitting on the bench and - and seeing people around me, see - uh, see what they do.
Mm, sometimes I go there alone and sometimes I go with my friend.
Like - like a - uh, 3 months once - three months to go - go to once.
Mmm, my favorite park actually is a Central Part in New York, although I didn't go there before, but I - I saw the park on a TV series and I - I saw many people just go to the park and - and have a picnic with their friends.  And - and I like the - the atmosphere in that park, so I want to go there someday.
Mm, I think she is - uh, she is brave and she is - she dares to - to talk to the man to stop he - stop smoking.  Uh, it's - it's really, uh - it's really a good behavior.  And - and in our daily life, uh, this situation is common, but, uh, there are few people who can talk to - talk directly to - to the people who is smoking.
Yes definitely.
Definitely yes.
Uh, for - for me I think, uh, it's good to some extent, mm, because, uh, uh, people are - are used to - to be silent.  And in - on the society there are often some - uh, some bad - bad behaviors and they - uh, they just - they have bad effect on, uh, people around - around him.  But there are no people, uh, who - although people are - are unsatisfied with him but they - they don't - they just don't, uh, stand out to - uh, to - to talk to others or to talk to the guy.  So, I think that we need some people who are - who have strong - mm, strong attitude to face peoples.
Mmm, I think - mm, I think it's - uh, actually it's really hard to say if the, uh, sand area is - is clean or not.  And - and - and if - uh, if childrens likes to play outside, if you say a sand area is not clean, I guess, that means, uh, everywhere outside are not clean - are not clean.  So, we don't have to insist on this point.
Yes.
