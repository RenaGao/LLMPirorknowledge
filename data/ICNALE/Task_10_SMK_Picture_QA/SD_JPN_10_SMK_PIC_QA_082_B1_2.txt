 And we use the ground.
 So, uh, okay.
 Hmm.
 Oh-ho!
 How do you feel, how do you feel about this lady, uh.
 Umm, uh, I like this type of lady because uh the lady who can say her opinion clearly, uh, I can understand her well, uh.
 Uh, I --- I disagree with that opinion uh because uh-huh I --- I don't know that, I --- I didn't know that before that the sandbox is dirty.
 So, umm, many, many people say that, umm, uh, the --- many people say that sandbox is dirty?
 Umm, umm, so, for example, if you, if you, uh, if kids play with slope, uh, he --- he can use one --- only one way, only the --- only uh up and down slope, uh, only that way.  
 But when kids use sandbox, kid   do, kids can do a lot, a lot of things freely---  
 Kids can make like this mountain or house or he can play with water freely---  
 ---uh so freely.
