 Yes, I like.
 Uh-huh, I play with slider.
 Umm, once a month.
 Yes.
 And the plank.  
 Favorite park?
 Umm, umm, near my house, there is a park and the park has plank only.
 And uh square and then I can play with balls and I can sit on bench.
 And it --- there it's very silent.
 So, I can relax there.
 Yeah.
 Oh, fantastic.
 Yes.
 Uh, in both situation   I like this girl maybe.  
 Because telling what she want --- she thinks is good.
 Uh, okay.
 Uh, I don't think so.
 Uh, the sandbox is dirty.
 I agree with this opinion, but children in dirty place   is not bad because dirty place can empower children's powers.
