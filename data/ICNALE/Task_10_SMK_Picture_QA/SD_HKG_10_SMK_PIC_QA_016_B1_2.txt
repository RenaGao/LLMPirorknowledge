Uh, no.
Uh, when I was small, the park - the park has always been the place that there are many parents and child - children and they are really, really noisy.
And every time I go to there and the, um, facilities are always occupieded   and I don't have a chance to play on it and my mother didn't allow me to do so.  So, I didn't really not very into going park.
No.  Eh, but I will pass by because it is the way to where I go home.
Uh, maybe it's very childish for university students or college students to go inside of park.  Maybe, if you have more a company and then you suddenly say, uh, maybe we could go and play the swing and then it will be less embarrassing.
Uh, I think my favorite park would be the Tai Po Waterfront Park because, uh, that was, uh, where - where I did my training as a athlest  , uh, team and every time I run there, the scene was beautiful, the sea, the - the breeze and it's very enjoying to run down there, and it's less noisy.  It's not a kind of park that normal children would go, so, yeah.
Um, I think she is doing some reasonable, uh, complaints towards the man because after all she is just thinking for the children and, uh - the child and the man is not really considering who is around.  So, the mother is okay.
Um, there is a saying that if you keep child from, uh, dirty things, then it will not - he will not get immuned to it so, uh, bacteria or so.  So, I think since she - he is just a child maybe he is looking for something, uh, not so - if you ban him from doing something, he would - more eager to do it.  So, maybe just like him go to the sand and play and then he'll eventually stop.
