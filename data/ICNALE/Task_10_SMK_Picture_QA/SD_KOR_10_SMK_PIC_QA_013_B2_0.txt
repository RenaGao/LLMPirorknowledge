Yeah.
Yeah when I was young.
Mmm, maybe I was with my friend riding a swing or riding on to jungle jams.
Yeah, we just played there.
Uh, I don't have that much time but when I want to ride skateboard, I do visit a park.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm, it's in my hometown.
It's called XXX  Green Park.
Uh, yeah, that is a really large park, like, they have a lot of lakes and they have like so many paths---
---and they even use a shuttle---
---to transfer from gate 1 to gate 2.
And there is a lot of family hanging out there and they also have a lot of events holding.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, she is expressing her feeling.
Well, that's, yeah, normal---
---genuine lady.
Because they can express how they feel, that's all, like if they don't know how to say something they really want - yeah I don't - I cannot explain how I feel about it, like I might feel "why didn't you do it?" and they might - they might say, "Oh, I'm too shy" or they might say something bad to me.  Well, they have to stand for it.
Well, it might - it might be a bit dirty but they can wash their hands after playing so that doesn't count for me.
