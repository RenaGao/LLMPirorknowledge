Yes.
I - I bring my little brother to the park and I can see the kids playing.  It is - I enjoy see them playing at the park and it gives me inner - inner clamness I think.
Just sitting and - sitting and watching them and sometimes I - I play with them.
In 1 month, maybe once in a month because I am at here and I doesn't go to the park with my brother.

For me, just let them play whatever they want because they are still a kid, but nowadays, there are famous about the bacteria on the - on - in the sand, so we need a precaution - precaution by washing our hand after playing in sand, but for me, there are not a big problem by playing with the sand.  It is good for our health I think because we in contact with our mother nature.
