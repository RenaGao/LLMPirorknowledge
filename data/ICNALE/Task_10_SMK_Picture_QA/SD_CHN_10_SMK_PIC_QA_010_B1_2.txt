No.
Because there are insect a lot - a lot - a lot of insects, I don't like - I don't like that.
Zero I think.
Favorite park.
Maybe, uh, USJ - USJ - United - Universal Studio---
Of Japan - yeah, I like to playing there because---
I think it is a park, yes.
Because the - because everyone seemed to get happy there and not like their face at normal.  They smile, uh, much than - than they - before they - um, how to say - I - I can see that always - they always, uh, smiling in - in that park.  So, um, if you enter the USJ, you - you feel like, um, not - uh, I feel that I am a new people.
Yes, that's make me feel exciting.
Yes.
Actually I going - I have go to the Disneyland twice.  Once in - uh, in my homeland, Shanghai, and once in Tokyo.  I feel maybe USJ is better because Disneyland have so many child.  Yes, and in China, there's a lot of old people going to Disneyland because, uh, the price is - is - is lower so they can just going to the Disneyland, but the emphasize - the - in - in Japan, it's - uh, freaky - it is totally different.  So, uh, China is worse than Japan because Japanese people like to have a costly or take something like that, and - but in USJ - USJ, you feel that you are in America, like something - uh, that's a lot in Japan anymore.
I think the - it's hard to met this kind of lady in Japan because people always, uh, not - don't to point out what are you wrong now.  Yes, people are more kindly, but maybe I think what - what this mother doing is right.
If I am a child, I don't want to go into the - the sandbox because, yes, actually it's dirty and - but for parents, I think that's - uh, the sandbox is a safety ground because it's soft and - and the child can, uh, spent - spent, uh, their times there and they will - they won't feel, uh, uh, nervous because, uh, it's a park and not that so many bad guys.
