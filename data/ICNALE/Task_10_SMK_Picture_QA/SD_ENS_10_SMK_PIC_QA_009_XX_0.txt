Uh-huh.
I do, yes.
I would normally go to them when there's some kind of seasonal thing like for example, cherry blossom and just sit and enjoy them more.  If I am unfamiliar with the park, maybe walk around and just explore it.
Three or four times a year maybe.
Not at the moment.  In my previous apartments there was one relatively close to my apartment I - I would visit.
Just a very wide open park.  Actually not much other than grass and some trees in the - the cherry blossom season.  Some children's playground equipment, but I am not a big fan of playground equipment myself, so---
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I - I respect who have the - the courage to - to stand up and say ���Stop' if another person is breaking the rules.
My mother?
In this scenario I'd be happy for that person to be my mother, yes, if she was prepared to stand up for me like that.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Hmm.
I think part of being a child is - is experiencing things and - and  making your own judgments.  The mother is there so if there is anything obviously dirty or dangerous, she can take the child away.  But I think children should be allowed to be children.
