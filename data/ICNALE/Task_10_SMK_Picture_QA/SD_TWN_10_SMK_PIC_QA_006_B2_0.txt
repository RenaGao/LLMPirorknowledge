Hmm, I don't like going to the park.
Uh, it's boring.  I don't know what I can do there.
Uh, I go to the park maybe twice a week.
Like, but I go there, it's not playing.  I go there maybe go picnicking and go just walking there.
Oh, maybe I, I have to say I like to go to the park, but I don't like to go to the playground in the park.
I like to go to the park in the riverside.
Just I can go biking there and in - when in the evening, the view is very beautiful.
Yeah, I also think she was - she is a strong lady, because you need some courage to tell a guy to stop smoking, because usually they look not a nice guy.  They look a little bit, hmm, make me scared.
Yes, I like this type of lady.
Hmm, as my mother.
Because maybe she can tell me do something and not to do something and make me to become a better guy.
Uh, yes, not as my girlfriend.

I agree with them, because when I - I also think that is not clean.  When I was a child, I play in the sandbox.  There was some dog's poop in this sandbox and I don't know.  I just take it and play it.  So, that's not clean for children and that's not safe.
