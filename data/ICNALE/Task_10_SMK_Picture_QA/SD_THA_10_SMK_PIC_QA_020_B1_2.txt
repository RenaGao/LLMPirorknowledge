I think now I'm, maybe not - not so enjoy like when I was young maybe, yeah.
As, uh, for this picture, the park is for the children.
Yes, but - but if, uh, someone ask me to go to the park for just make a walk or go to picnic something like that, I would love to.
My favorite park.  Um, uh, park, the park here that, here near---
Yes, in Hat Yai.
Yes, can - yes, we can say that, Hat Yai park.
Once a week?
Uh, there, we can make a walk, uh, often make a walk with my friends.  And sometime I go to do, I don't know how to say it in English, uh, we can paint it in the, uh---

Uh, I - I think she do the - the - the good thing, the right thing that, uh, this is not good, right?  When someone smoking and then affect another one.  So it - uh, it is good to say to him that can you stop that, but - but not to say like you are wrong, cannot smoke, or something like this, but ask them, uh, to stop or, uh, go anywhere that is far away.  
Um, something like this?
I think kids can play in the sandbox, uh, but after that they have to clean themselves, so, uh, very, very good.  Uh, this is not too dirty to play, but yes, uh, I think the kids must - must have experience for, uh, anything.  So, they want to do it, so they - we - we need to, uh, accept them that, yes, we can try this, we can try this, but after that you need to---
Let them try it but you can say the reason for them to, uh, after that that, um, if you play - after that you need to care to do - uh, care to have a shower something like this.
Yes.
Yes.
