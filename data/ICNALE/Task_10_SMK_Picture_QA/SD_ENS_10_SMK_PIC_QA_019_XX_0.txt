Yeah.
With kids, sure.
Do whatever they want me to do.  It's - it's their world.
Japanese children typically - typically like to play hide and seek and run around, catch me, and whatnot.  But yeah, I - I do things that, I guess all parents don't do, I throw them in trees and push them backwards up slide and throw them down slides and everything to make them feel adult-ish, basically yeah.
Recently, it's been quite a bit.  About two or three times a week, looking after somebody's son.
This month?  Yeah, probably four or five times already.
Not particularly.
Aww, it's just a standard small park between buildings.  Hmm, probably about no bigger than 100 square meters.  It's got a slide.  It's got two swings.  It has the barricades or whatever you want to call it around the swings, which I think are actually a hazard.  The ground is not grass as I think it should be.  It is a typical sand scenario.  There are a few trees there.  Umm, but unfortunately a lot of the older locals come down and start smoking in front of the children just like in that scenario there.
Well, I can't judge exactly how she approached the situation, but I assume she did it in a nice manner.  Yeah, of course, I would prefer to have a wife that can stand up for the children when I'm not around.  Yeah, definitely.
Yes.
Oh, for god's sake.
XXX   providing is my first question.  Kids are kids.  Let them get dirty.  I'm not afraid to get dirty with them either.  Yeah.
However, I did think the definition of a park did involve something called grass and what is not seen in this country.
