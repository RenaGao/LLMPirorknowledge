Umm, my favorite park was Luneta Park.
Umm, Luneta Park I - I appreciate the beauty of Luneta Park because it has a lot of things to offer, especially when you are really into umm, misery or something like that - if you feel something end.  Umm, the music in Luneta really umm, relive what I am feeling.  So I like being at Luneta.
I like what the mother did to the man because he   is just protecting his   child from the smoke and from the danger it might cause.
I like her as my mother because umm, my mom always protecting me and it's - my mom is like her.
I think it's part of our childhood to - to play in the sand.  Because personally, when I was a kid I used to play in the sand and it's really umm - it's really enjoyable and I think this is some kind of memories that umm, I could really reminisce.
