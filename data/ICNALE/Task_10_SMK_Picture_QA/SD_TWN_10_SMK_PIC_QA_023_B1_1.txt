When I was young, I like to go to - go to the park.
Um, um, if I go to the park with my friend I usually play with just like hide - hide and seek.
Recently, in 1 month, I - I just go to park because my - there is a little park, uh, is near my home.  So, I - every time I go home I need to through the park.
Every day.
Just walk.
My favorite car---
Park.  Park.  Park, yes.  I can say that, yeah.
Yes.  Near your - my house and also near my college.
Because it's - it's very big and you can - you can observe many small - small animals on there.
Um, I think she is very brave but - but I think XXX   behavior she must think and if this man didn't accept her advices, he may - she may get hurt.  So, I think she - maybe - I think she may just take her kid away.
My mother - some - sometimes she is like this kind but most of the time she is very soft mother.
I - I hope I would be like this type of woman but I think I - I have not - I have not brave.
XXX   maybe many trashes - trash in the sandbox because every people may just like eat or drink something in the side of the sandbox and - and forget some trash at there and with the wind blows they will fall into the sand - sandbox - sandbox.  So, it might be more and more dirty but if I - I think when you are playing and you have to take all this garbage it can still be a good place for children to play.
