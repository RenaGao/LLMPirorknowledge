Yes.
Uh, roller skating with my sister.
Recently?  No.
No.  I just went - went - went by, I guess.  I need to go.  I need to pass the park.
Um, one path - um, I joined many, uh, schools and things.  So, I went to school every day with my classmate and practicing some.  So, we need to perform.
Um, my favorite park - can I say which is it?
Okay.  It's, uh, XXX   park.
It is very big.  And when I am junior high, we go to that park, uh, when we - uh, after school.  We play the basketball and, uh, uh, what's that?  Uh, I - I - I don't know what this English is, the game.  And the girls need to XXX   other people and, uh, it has very big and green, uh, grass.  And it also has water - we can play.
Yeah.  I think I - I - I am this kind.
Both.
I think, uh, when - I think that is the right thing I - I need to do.  There is wrong thing I need to stop others to do that.  And, uh, but - but - but - but I'm not stronger - strong as my mom.  She can do more things than I can do.
No.  I - I think kids need to play in the sandbox.  It's - uh, it's very fun and I - I love to playing the sandbox.  You can - you can just wash your hand after playing, so it is not - not a problem like this if it is clean or not.  The - um, maybe the - the - the slide, wood, the stair and, uh, the - I don't know.  Many things we - we can touch every day.  And it had been touched by many people.  So, maybe - maybe this table is not clean enough, maybe.  Yeah.
