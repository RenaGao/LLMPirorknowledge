Hmm.
Uh, in the pasts as a kid, yes---
---to go with my parents, my - my simblings   that as XXX   day in - in Sunday we all - we play in the playground and just have so much fun in the past.
Recently?
I guess it's zero.
I play with the   I am - play hide and seek with other children that who come to the park - who came to the park, and for exam - we have previously just don't really have hide and seek, we have so many games and in the park that a bunch of children, they have a wonderful - afternoon have a wonderful time in the XXX  .
That my favorite perk - pa - park.
Um, my favorite park is the park we were just, eh, next to my - my building that, uh, because in the - and the - there are so many children, so many kids who with - who come to there and have a gathering and have so many, eh, game sets all the children, they - they could play together.  They can't - um, they can - they can - they could met new friends in - in that park so it is a, uh, wonderful place that I still - I - I - I miss it so much.
Um, I think she - she is just doing what a mother who would do to protect her child to - to do the brave thing to bring no harm to her child so he just - because of her mother nature.
And, I think that it is a - a - that to me it is the fact that the sandbox is dirty, it's not clean because so many people - so many people will play in there and they may not be cleaning in there.  But, I think, um, they can still play in there and the parents should teach their children that when playing in the sandbox they cannot - the children cannot touch their eyes, their ears and to in some - in some degree that isn't doing that they can, uh, protect themselves in - while playing in the - in the sand - in the sandbox.  So, and this is also a chance for their parents to teach the children about something - about hygienity  .
