Oh mother!   but she looks young to me.
Uh, yes, I do like going to the park.
Uh, sometimes I just stroll, stroll and jog, but sometimes I go just to eat there.
Yeah.  With my friends, like, in the evening we buy something and eat something.
Yes.
Probably once or twice.
Jogging, picnic or sometimes just walking, and that's all.
My favorite park got to be one at XXX   The Lake Garden XXX   because it is very big and very big and also, like, somehow I feel that going to that park is not safe, because that's, like, lot of people there, so if I go to jog then it won't be safe.
Uh, with my mom, my brother and also sometimes with my friends.
Yes.  I agree because not many can come to the smoking man and ask them to stop smoking, so I think, she is very strong lady, as she knows what she wants and she get it done.
Yes.
Uh, maybe one of my friends.
Because, uh, the strong lady as my friend would be better, maybe good because, uh, she would know what she wants and she would speak for myself.  Like, I don't have to - to guess what she wants and I wouldn't like someone that clings and - and - and expect me to do more for them.
Since they can take care of themselves better.
Uh, I think, I don't agree with them, because to me everywhere you go you wouldn't find really clean environment, so, what should be done instead is, after they done playing around they should go and wash themselves really well, so that they wouldn't get any XXX  .  Because if you forbid kids from playing around and really, if they will - they would not get better, improve their, like, cognitive or their skills and their thinking abilities, so for me kids should be playing around, exploring things for them to grow and to becomes better energy.
