Okay.
Yes.
I mostly play by the swings, the swing.
Um, may be just sit around on the bench looking at people behaving.
In a month well, maybe it's 2 - it's 2 times a week.  So it may be about 6 times a month.
Well, mostly I go there for mostly at - in the nearby park there is a jogging lane.  So I mostly jog there and after jog I play in the park for a while.
Ah, my favorite park ah, it's actually - I live in Kuala Lumpur.  So usually I go to Taman XXX .  So that's why I love using the park there.
Because in that park there is always people right from the - from early in the morning up until in the night.  So in the park there is many activities.  When there is many people there many food stalls and many activities such as playing cards and the bubbles.  So I like sitting in that kind of environment.
Um, I think yes - yes.
Because the - ah, the - XXX  mostly when we see smoker and even like the smell has XXX  so mostly people will be scared of him.  So this woman is really  brave .
Yes.
Well my mother - right now my mother is kind.  So she is not really a kind of a strong lady.  So I can't really mention that.  If you have a strong mother, I think no, I can't prefer a strong---
Ah, yes.
Because this type of person ah, I think they don't really scared.  They did not really - they don't really how can I say they're not afraid of anything, this kind of woman sometimes but XXX .
Yes.
Well, I think well it is dirty.  Well if - ah, if the park is not - is unattended most of us have to clean it, yes.  So for kids to play in the sandbox I think it is important because in a sandbox I see most kids well in Malaysia, we don't really have this but in outside of Malaysia, I think most kids do amazing things with the sand - in the sandbox. Sometimes a huge castle, many XXX  I think.  No, I don't really agree with them.
