Um, uh, walk through the park is usually but stay there for playing is really often.  The last time I playing is, um, maybe a year ago.
Favorite park.  Um, I like XXX   park.
Because I am living in XXX   is really near to my home and there - there are a lot of facilities.  As I mentioned, there are swing, uh, not just the playground.  There are a big grasses in there and many families or visitors like go there for picnics.
I really appreciate her because - eh, because she is just a woman and she need to face a man.  She don't know - she doesn't know what background of the man, if the man is a bad guy she may face danger, but she is really strong because she need - she - she want to pro - she wants to protect, eh, her son and I really appreciate her.
I think I agree with those people who think it is dirty because, uh - because no one will clean this area and when is rain - after raining or it's really wet and - and also many kids go there for playing, I think it is dirty place.
