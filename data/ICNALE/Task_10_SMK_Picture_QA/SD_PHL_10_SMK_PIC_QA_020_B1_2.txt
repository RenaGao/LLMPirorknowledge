Just so, hang on.
I guess twice.
Just sit there and see the kids playing.
It's just near our house.  Actually it's in front.  Then, there is the swing and slides.  There are kids playing around there.
All right.  Now next, the mother in the picture criticized the smoker and made him stop smoking.  I think she is a very strong lady.  How do you feel about her?  Do you thing, do you like this type of lady?
Yes, because she really talked to the guy and asked him to stop smoking, because it's a playground and there are a lot of kids there.
