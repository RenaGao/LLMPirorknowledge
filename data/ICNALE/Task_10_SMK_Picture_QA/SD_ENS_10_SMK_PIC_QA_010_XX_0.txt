And it's really big and peaceful and has a big water feature as well.
Uh, it's very long.  It's - it's - it's a - it's a very long walk to go all the way through the park, it takes up an entire block.  Umm, and, uh, in the - in the spring season it's very beautiful because of all the - there's a bit of sakura around the area.
