Eh, swing.
Uh, I think in China in Beijing, there is a park named, um, temp - t um, temple park, uh, I - I -I -I can't - maybe in Chinese is the park of ditan XXX  in the past it was a temple and now it become a park, a very big park.  And in the park, there are many interesting buildings and - and, you know, there is a place, eh, hmm, there - there is a place and - and there are a wall - the wall is just like a circle, um, and may - if you - if you stand between - if you stand behind the wall and say something and others maybe it's far from you but always stand behind the wall because the wall is very large.  And they can heard what - they can heard what you are saying, so it's mag - I think it's magical.
Yeah.
Uh, I - I think it - I think it's good.  Um, I - she - she is a mother and she should protect her kids so, um, maybe my - my mother actually was not - not very strong.
Not very strong.
But not very strong, yeah, before I was born. But after I - after my born - borning and she must to be you - you know, may - maybe there are some things he was fra - afraid of and I - uh, as a little girl I always afraid of many things, so she must to be more - more strong or to protect me.
So, um.
Umm, I - I - I think - yeah, really it's a little dirty, you know, everywhere play with the sand and maybe there are some kids, their hands is not very clean and after they playing the sand the other kids maybe will play the sands and - play with the sand so their hands will become dirty and if they use their hands to eat something, I - I think is unhealthy.  But maybe every - after every kids playing with the sand, they can wash their hands and clean their shoes so I - I think that's okay.
