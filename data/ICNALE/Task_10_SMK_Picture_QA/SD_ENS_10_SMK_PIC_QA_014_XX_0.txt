I just like enjoying, just walking around enjoying just the trees, nature itself. 
Recently I don't visit parks but when I was a student I used to go around the park when I had free time or when I just wanted to relax.
How - I can only think may be 2 or 3 times as of last year that I've been to a park.

Yeah, they are - they are just not um, when they get in touch with it they like have like stomachaches or they cannot even eat like just food that's been not spoiled yet but close to spoiling and they still have um, food poisoning.
