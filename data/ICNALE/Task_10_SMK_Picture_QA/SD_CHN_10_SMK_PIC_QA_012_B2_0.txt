Yes.
Uh---
Sometimes I go to the park for activities, uh, like doing pushups.
Pushups, of course of the---
Yeah, yeah.
One month?
I think every day.
Yes, yes.
Oh, okay.  Uh, I think the favorite park for me is the Shinohara Goi---
Yes, yes, yes.
Because I lived, uh, close to the XXX , uh, station and the park is really close to my house.  Eh, and there the very good, uh, scene for the park is at this - both Saturdays and Sundays there is a, uh - there is a baseball playground so in the morning, eh thus the - the - the childrens are wearing in suites and practice and they always - they always yell like yeah and like that.  It's really passion.  And I think it's a really good scene for me.
Uh, um, I think - I think this lady is a really gentle and very strong emotional.  Uh, because in the picture one he - uh, she - she watch the - her baby, you know, really, uh, sweet smell, uh, but after her boy was - was - got coughed about the smoke, she just went really seriously scene, uh, no smoking to the man over there.  So - and - and, uh, I think gesture front, uh, I think gesture for her - eh, gesture, body language, she is - she is showing her angry to the man and she is not really afraid because the man is, you know, yellow hair but she didn't seems really afraid, I mean she is really strong---
---I think.
Uh, um, I think - uh - I - I think as long as we can keep the sand clean, it's a good thing for the children because, uh, in my opinion I think nowadays that the - the cities has developed so - so big - so - so significantly to for the previously, there is a city always concreted buildings or bridges or roads, there is no natural views or very - very naturals environment for the children to experience the - the trees or sand or - or animals.  And I think it's a good ways there in the park some sand for the children to play with.
