Hmm.
I don't like go to the park because reason why, the reason is, uh, yeah maybe I will played when I in the child but I - I don't, I have no memories.  Uh, I think playing indoor or playing sport will be a better choice for me.
Yeah.
Uh, park - is Ocean Part   an option?
Uh, yeah, I have been Ocean Park within this two years.
Yeah.  Because I don't like go to park in the spare time, but yeah I will like - I prefer hiking in the mountain, uh, because I like walking around but not just limit in one region or one song and in Hong Kong there are less park for teenagers but not kid, uh, to play or to enjoy, I mean the coworking splay - space, uh, lesser and lesser, uh, lesser.  And, yeah, so I really don't have a lot of chance to go to this kind of park, yeah.
Uh, I will say as Hong Kong only have two theme park; one is Ocean Park and one is Disneyland, and I will say Ocean Park is more attractive to me because, uh, I don't like the - I mean I have sel - I don't have a lot of, uh, experience on the cartoon, the Disneyland cartoon, and - but the Ocean Park is much more exciting because there is a lot of, uh, roller-skater and there is a lot of, uh, games which is aiming for boys, I will say, because they are much more, uh, exciting, yeah.
Yeah.
Um, I will say, um, uh, she is doing appropriating things because he prevent - she prevent, uh, her kid getting harmful or getting hurt.  So, I think it is the nature of a mother, mother want to protect their kids no matter why, uh - under any circumstance.  Uh, she is not physically strong but, uh, her mind is so strong that she needs to protects, uh, her kid, uh, no matter what, even she is facing a strong - a muscular guy.  So, I think, uh, she is a good mom.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Uh, yeah, the reason is a lot of people are saying the sandbox is, uh, not clean, maybe because of animal will, uh, yeah, walk - pass by or people will step on the sandbox or even some glasses or broken glasses may hidden in the sandbox, this is dirty and dangerous.  But I think it shouldn't be banneded   again, uh, not allowing people or not recommended, uh, people to play in the sandbox because this is a good, uh, memories for them, uh, for kids to playing in the playground.  Um, but before that, um, I think as a families or I think as a parents they need to pay extra attention on whether it's a safety in the sandbox, uh, if the kids play alone in there because there is a lot of like bad guy, they will keep in that, the kids or a lot of reasons.  So, they, I think not just - not paying attention on dirty or clean, uh, should be pay attention on the safetiness.
Yeah.
