Well, like seriously nowadays I can't, I don't have time.

My favorite park is actually not near my house or my university XXX .  Yeah, I go there a lot because I like to like watch shows that place and there is a big park around there for XXX .  There are many things going on there.  They have - they play music there and sing there and I like to see those things with my friends.  
Uh, yes.  
Yeah.
Um, how do I feel about her?  
Well---
Yeah, yes, she seems really strong and I think she is brave.  
Yeah.  
As my friend?  
Well, I - I think this kind of personally is good like no negative about it but when I walk - when I'm walking with my friends and my friends step up and do things like this, I - I think I might feel a bit scared.  
Um, I think children should play in the sandbox if they want because I always played there in the sand and I grow up healthy.
