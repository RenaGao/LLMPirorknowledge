Ocean Park.  Is it okay?
Um, I think the park is great because they have a lot of facility and things to do but, uh, you don't have to entrance fee - entrance fee then but, uh, if - the other park is like Victoria Park which they have like lot of trees and grass that people can just smell the good air and - I don't know it get closer to nature, that's how really---
Uh, she is - she speak, uh, like really direct, so she just went up to speak to the guy instead of running a - like going away with the child say like we should just leave or something like that.  So, it's probably a pretty brave.

Uh-hmm.
I think a lot of places is not clean, not only the sandbox, like maybe other places, playground or public area, like but you cannot escape everything that is dirty so I think it's fine.
