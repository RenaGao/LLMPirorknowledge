Yes.
No.
Because I don't like children, so I don't like to go playground.
No, I always spend my time at home.
Um, because I don't have time to go to the park.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Yeah.
Okay, I have been park like near my house.
I only thing I play at the park is only the swing.
And  
Ah, yes, the seesaw.  It's the only the thing.  I didn't get more.
With my brother and my sister.
House.
Walk, bicycles.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because she tried to protect her son.
But in the first picture, her son is very XXX  .
Right now, my mother is very strong.
Okay, around my house, there's a big tree, a mango tree.
So, she cut, she climb up to the tree and with the - the saw, she cut the tree.
And pulled the tree.
Strong, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Should not.
I disagree.
Because, uh, sometimes, we have to teach our son or our brothers, little brother, uh, to play outside so like playing in the sand because this is the main thing how they react in the environment if it they don't touch, don't play in the sand, they don't know how to react with the environment.  Even though we take a walk, enjoying the scenery, so is the reaction with the environment.
So, XXX  .
Okay, done.
