Yes.
Uh, yes, sure.
Ah, I usually go to the park with my friends to have a jog, to do some activities like, jogging, or do some exercises, cycling, uh, yeah.
Uh, I can say about five times in a week, yes.
Yes.
Uh, the --, uh, --  the main thing that I'm always do when I arrive at the park is I usually go for it jog because for me I like jogging because it is makes you feel like there's yours times to spend with yourself and to spend your mind with the environment so you clear your mind to feel that distressed and working it plus makes your body more healthier.
Yes.
For me, uh, my favorite park that I usually go with my friend is Tasik Shah Alam.
Yes.
Uh, about Tasik Shah Alam Is like a main attraction in Shah Alam because it's a big lake and you can do many stuff there.  They have kayaks.  You can go cycling there.  You can go picnic there and they have playgrounds there.  So the view is quite beautiful.  So I usually do cycling from Klang to Shah Alam with my friends just to go to Tasik Shah Alam to do some exercises and to release some stress.
Yes.
Yeah I strongly agree with that because, uh, for someone to -- to tell a guy to put out his smoke because, uh, his certainty -- tendency about this child is a big -- is a brave thing to do, because, uh, she is alone there.  I can't -- I can't identify she's going to have with, if he is husband or not.  So for me it's a good thing to have this type of person nowadays to stand up for themselves.
Yeah, I strongly like this type of lady.
I can say both.
Because, uh, for me to see them to be proud of themselves and to talk about, uh, something that she really want, for me it's quite inspiring because as you know that most girls are shy and they don't like to talk that often. Then they just agree with a man when making discussion on something.  So for me when hearing a good stand up for themselves and just speak out about what they want from me is inspiring.
Yes.
For me, uh, the sand area usually kids go to the park to play with the equipment that was provided by the government or the park manager.  So for me if there was a sand -- sand part for child to play with sand or stuff for me it's -- they should be allowed to play and the -- the park -- the park manager should take charge in cleaning and just providing a safe area for this child to play in a -- in that park.
Sure.
