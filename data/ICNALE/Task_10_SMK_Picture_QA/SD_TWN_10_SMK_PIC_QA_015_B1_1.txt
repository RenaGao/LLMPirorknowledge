Yes, because - uh, park - there are many instrument - instruments---
---in the park---
---that I can play.
Maybe once a month to Dang park - uh, Forest Park.
Uh, sort of.
I just - just go walking.
Because I can feel relaxed.
Favorite park?
Name it?
Oh, my favorite park is near my college.
It's filled with a lot of trees---
---that I can breath the air---
---breath the air and relax - XXX  .
Yes.
What else?  And there are a lot of kids.
And I feel good when I watch - when I watch them to play.
I - I like this type of lady because they - uh, he - she did this just for her kid.
She tried to protect her kid.
I think it's very good.
Yes, what you mean?  
As my mother.
Because I prefer that I am protected by my mother rather than my girlfriend.
I think - I think is   - I think it's only in the Asian country---
---that the parents think that is not clean.
Um, in the movie I watched, in maybe America or Canada, they just - they just bring their kids to the park and just - they - they let them go.
They doesn't   care about whether the area there is clean.
Just have fun.
