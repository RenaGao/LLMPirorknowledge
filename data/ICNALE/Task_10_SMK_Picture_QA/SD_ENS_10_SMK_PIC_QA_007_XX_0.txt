Yeah.
I do.
I have a dog.
Uhm, running, jumping with my dog, uhm, taking lots of pictures.
Uhm, kind of all -  every other day I go to the park with my dog.
Oh, yeah  there is a park in front of SUMINOEKOEN   station SUMINOEKOEN   station.
Well there's no -  most park in Japan is just sand, but uhm, I like this park because it has flowers, a lot of greenery and - but the center is round.  It has a like brick floor uhm, so my dog will not get so dirty at - in this park if she -  she plays.  And there's pigeons, she loves running, like, the pigeons. If I take her to another regular park with the sand and dirt, then she'll come home dirty.  And I don't want that, so that's why I like this park.
Yeah.
Uhm, I - I would say she did the right thing because - I mean it - it can influence the health of her child.  But if she was in the park with no child, I would say just to mind her own business.
Yeah I mean  
As a mother yeah.
Yes.
No.
Uhm, well I mean the health of the child comes first so I mean -  also you shouldn't be smoking in the park where there are kids.
Uhm, well, it depends, uhm, I - I have seen many parks in Japan the sandbox are -  are clean.  People do come and clean them and new sand is - is put in.  Since because I work on a -  before in a kindergarten uhm, some of the teachers do go to the park before the children go - the students go to the park, like the day before and they clean the sandboxes themselves.  And I have done it myself too, like we go to the park and clean it before the kids go.
