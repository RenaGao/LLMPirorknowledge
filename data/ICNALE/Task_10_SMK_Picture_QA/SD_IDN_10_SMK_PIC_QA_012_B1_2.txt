Yeah, sometimes.  But I more prefer to going around the city riding the bike.
Yes.  Last time I go the city park like that, I play some football I think and also I do jogging, a small running like that.  So, mostly when I go to the city park I do sports.
Yeah I think around a week ago I went to  
Yeah, so the city park in the north of the city square of - of the city square is - is like a field who has a two twin tracks in the middle of it.
And also they have some caf�� around it and also they have a big mosque in the west side of the field, yeah.
I think every woman has to be strong, independent, brave, and they don't have to afraid about anything.  In the picture we can see that she directly herself criticize the smoker and that's I think really, really good.  Because, you know, maybe she thinks it really, really disturbs her children.
Yeah actually especially in our country the maintenance of the city square or - or city park is not really, really good.  So, it could be in the sandbox there is some like cat feces or.
Yeah the things that if children takes it, it will be dangerous for them.
Yeah.  In a dirty park, you have to underline that.
