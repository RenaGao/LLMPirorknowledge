Yes.
Well, I think, uh, when I was really, really young, like, uh, primary school age I actually played in a playground, uh, during weekends.  But now, I don't think, uh - I do - I don't - I don't go - actually go to the play - playground anymore, uh, nor do I think that children nowadays actually go to playground because they have so much technology to play with their iPads, the iPhones.  They were like really the - the past entertainment for my generation now.
No, no.
No.
Not a single time.
Um, does that include theme park or just like a children park?
Well, I - I am a big fan of the Ocean Park and Disneyland but, uh, the last time I went to the Ocean Park was actually more than a year ago now because I am actually too busy to go plus the entrance fee is actually quite expensive nowadays.  It costs like hundreds of dollars to enter into the park, so, and I - I can't find people to go with me, so.  I - I am a fan of a theme park, but I don't have time for it as of now.
Yes, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I, uh - to be quite honest, I don't - I don't think, uh, that puts a strong image on, um, feminism.  Because if it's the father of the son, I am sure that, uh, he'll do the same to the smoker.  So, I mean, it's no big difference whether it is a woman or a man.  This is what a normal person would do when you see a young child coughing because of, uh, this - the smoke and it is really in our responsibility to like convince other to quit smoking because it's not good for us, it's not good for them.  So, yes.
Yes.
Well, to be quite honest, no public areas are ever clean to me.  It's not just about the - the sand place, uh, the table here are not cleaned even though it looks clean.  There are bacterias everywhere.  It's just you - you can't really say that, yes, this is completely clean.  It's - there is no bacteria, no viruses on it.  I think it's just ha - what you do after you touch these unpleasant things that you need to wash hand before you eat and take a shower after you play in a sand pool.  I think it's just the, uh, what you need to do afterwards to eliminate the - the risk of you getting sick.  It's not, um - yes, I don't think even if it looks cleanliness, it's not really clean, and if it doesn't look clean, it's definitely not - not clean at all.  Yes.
