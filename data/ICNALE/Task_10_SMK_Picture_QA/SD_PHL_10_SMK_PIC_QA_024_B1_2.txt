I love - yes I love going to the park.
Just watching real kids playing.
It's only twice or once, because I don't have enough time.
Yes.  Umm my favorite park is - it's in XXX   Circle.  It's very nice there.  You could see a lot of children playing and also for happy family, having picnic and - that's my favorite park.
Yes.  I feel to that their mother is a strong lady, because approaching a man is not easy.  You have to - you have to have a courage so that the man could - so that the man could stop smoking.
Yes I - I think that yes, kids should not play in the sandbox because it is dirt - dirty but if the kids really want to play there, I guess umm, after playing the mother or the parent should wash the hands of the children properly.
