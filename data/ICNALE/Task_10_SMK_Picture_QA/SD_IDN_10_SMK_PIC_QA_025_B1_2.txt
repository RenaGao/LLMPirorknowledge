Okay.  A few weeks ago a boy and his sister played in a park, play in the sand and then suddenly there is a man who is smoking passed by them and then the sister saw it and feel so angry because his - his brother have a coach   and then it's ah he don't - he don't like the feel of a smoke.  And then the sister try to explain the - the there.  But - but and the sister tried to explain that smoking is not - it's not good for health.  And then the man feel so guilty.  He is put the smoke down and then he apologize the sister and that.
Uh-huh.
Hmm I like it.
Because in a park we can see some people and then I can feel so comfortable with the situation in the park.  So I like to be there.
Hmm I think one or two times.
Hmm.  I think I just walking around and then I take some food and then talk with my friends, something like that.
Not really.
Ah it's - it has many trees there  
It's just relative there is big trees and a small trees and then it has so many communities gather around there.
And then there is the people who sell the drink and then food and something like that.  There is so many children and his - and their parents, there is so many like me, many people with his friend, with her friend getting around talking there and then usually there they are always the time in the park more around like 1 to 2 hours, something like that.
Hmm.
Uh-huh.
Yeah I think.
I am sorry.
Uh-huh  .
Hmm, I think both of them is needed for a mother and a friend there to be strong.
Because if there is no - if they are no   strong in the character, they will be easily to not - they have no uh I think like the realism and then when they want to say something the easily attack back with people, something like that.
Hmm  .
Hmm.
Uh-huh.
Hmm.  I think that's not - uh it's not good but there is just a sand.
But I think the hygiene is one of the important things to notice.
Hmm, yeah I agree with that.
Uh-huh.
