Thank you very much sir.
All right sir.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Not very often.
Maybe thrice a month.
Thrice.
Three times, yeah, three times a month.
Okay, my favorite park is near - near my house.
Because near my house is more convenient for - for me to assess home, and whenever I feel like going back home and having my house schedule as well, so it makes me do both, like play out and still go back home very quickly and complete my day tasks.
Sorry, say it again sir.
About the mom?
Yeah, she feels so terrible like - like, like smoking is not really a good thing for - for anybody because it's going to - it's going to cause him harm rather than - rather than causing good.
Yeah, to some extents because she is trying to make - she is trying to make something good out of that boy - of the little girl or something like that.
Yeah, I will like her as my mom.
Because she looks - she looks very strict on things that are not really - that aren't really worth to be anything that - that doesn't really contributes to anything in life because smoking doesn't really contribute anything to life, rather  than contributing sickness or every other bad thing.  So she is against this.
Yes.
I think kids should play in the sand box and they should be dirty because it's an experience for the kids to understand between being dirty and being clean.  So if you leave them just being clean always, they don't know how to be dirty and they feel okay, it's all about being clean and when it comes to a place that is dirty, anything can happen, they fall into a place that is dirty and they are going to be highly disappointed and feel like killing themselves or something like that.  So it's better they train up like that.
