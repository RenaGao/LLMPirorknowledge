Yes.
Not that much.
Because, um, it's up to the weather.
Most of the weathers are like it's too hot or too cold.
So, I don't like to go to outside when it's hot or cold.
In a month recently, uh, seven times.
Less than 10 times.
Yes.
Running on the tracks.
Yes.
Not just the reason, usually the park was really near to my home.  So, if I go somewhere from outside of my home, I have to go through the park.

Yeah.
Yes.
I have a favorite park near my home.
It is very beautiful.
Especially in the spring cherry blossoms are around the park and it's really famous when the cherry blossoms.
I will highly recommend you that to visit the park in the spring season.
Uh, also, uh, there was - uh, there is a really beautiful grass and there are lots of pets with the people and also there is a track which I can run on the track and there are also like, uh, exercise machines to workout.
It's very good.
Okay.
Yeah.

Yes, as a mother, she is like very strong and she really loves his son - uh, her son.
I think I don't know she - usually she is a strong like that or at least for her son, she wanted to protect her son.  So, I like that.
I don't agree with that.
Because when I was young, I was always in the sandbox and it helps - it helped me to get the immunity system.
So, even though it's not clean, most of the children have the immunity to overcome from the dirty sandbox. 
And also it's really fun to play in the playground.  So, I think it's good to play in the sandbox.
