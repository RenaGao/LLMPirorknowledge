I don't like doing to - go to the park.
I - I played with my, uh, friends but not only in the park.  We just go outside.
Recently?
Uh, I can say never.
Because I am grownup and I have no interest into - in going to park.
Uh, you know Disneyland in Hong Kong.
Okay.  Uh, Disneyland is actually a theme park.  Uh, there are many characteristics - uh, characters which is in the Disney movies, and there are some - something like the rollercoaster or - I don't remember - I don't remember or you can, uh, experience the - the - some - some scenes in the movies in that park.
Many - many, uh, lovers like to go to Disneyland park.
I'm - I'm - I'm not very enjoyed.
Um, I think she is doing good for her children.  I think I have no, uh, any - I have no - any bad comments for - on - on her habit.
Girlfriend, I don't like some - some - uh, some, uh, girls with some, uh, characteristic, but my mother she actually is that type.
Then, everyday I will be, uh, criticized when I - if I do something wrong.  That make me very - that will give me very - uh, very much pressure.
The sand is dirty?
Okay.  Uh, I think - I also think so.  Maybe, the sand actually - it caries many, uh, virus.
But as a child, I - I think there is, uh, not that - very much - uh, there is no need for them to, uh, consider about it because child, they actually do not think so much.  But after they grow up, they may - maybe - maybe realized that they should not left their child - uh, children to play with sand.
