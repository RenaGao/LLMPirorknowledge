Yeah, I like park.
I play a game.
I play a game called Pokemon GO.
Yeah.
So, that is a game like walking, I should walk to the park or school and if - if I get to like near to the park there comes out Pokemon is there. 
In a month, maybe once in a week.
Yeah.
Yes.
Uh, actually I said, once I - I go to the park once in a week, but maybe, I think maybe more. 
Because there is a park near my apartment.  It is really, it's like connected.  It is right beside my apartment.  So, I can easily go there.
But as I can see in the picture the boy is like coughing.  So, she - she is - she is his mom, so maybe she got angry and she got upset easily I guess.
A tough lady.
Mmm, I think people - people should tell something like about the bad situation.  So, I think she is not very bad person.
Oh.
Yeah.  But I - I think the kids like play outside is important thing.
I've heard, I - I read before sand like playing thing like touching the nature thing is like good for kids like development.
And - and I've read XXX  option.  It can, uh, enhance the immune system.  I - I just not - I just not - I don't really--- 
Yeah.
And also I guess that's nice if just boy just wash his hand later.
