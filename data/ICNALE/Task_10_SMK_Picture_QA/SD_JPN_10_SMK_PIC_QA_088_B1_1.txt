 I, I like going to the park.
 When I was a child, I like   I like seesaw.
 I almost don't go to park.
 My favorite park has sand and - my favorite park don't   have many playing field but there are, there are many kinds of flowers so I like to see them and walking, walking, eh, there around them.
 I think this, this woman is dependable.
 Dependable.
 Because she, she have the ability to say no, no.
 Yes.
 Eh I, I cannot say sternly no.
 I think sand is all --- already dirty so it --- after, after, after children playing with sand, they should wash their hands so then it is not, it is okay.
