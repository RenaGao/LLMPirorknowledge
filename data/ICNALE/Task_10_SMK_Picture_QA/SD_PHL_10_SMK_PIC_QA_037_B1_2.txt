Yes.
Umm I usually swing, used to swing in the park.
I think for almost ah a year or not necessarily I think this is some playground but in a park umm I wasn't able to come this month in the park, sir.
Yes.
Ah umm I think my most favorite park was the Karina Memorial Circle, because when I was in grade 6, that was one of the destination of our field trip and I have a lot of memories to share with my former elementary classmates.  So I think that is my most favorite park.
Ah I admire her bravery for doing such because not all you know women will be able to speak to a man, especially a man who is smoking.  So some might get intimidated but this mother ah show her courage since her child was really affecting by the smoke coming from the smoker.  So this shows that the mother will do everything for her child.
Yes.
Because my mom is always there for me.  My mom cares a lot and I know that actually me my my father is smoking, so my mom is always ah mad at him especially when we are at home.  So he she always umm told my father to stop smoking because it is bad for the health of of our family and of course for the health of my father.
Umm I think it is normal for a child to play umm everything that they saw they see on the park.  I think there is no bad about letting them enjoy what they are doing and ah experiencing and let them experience the joy of being a children.
