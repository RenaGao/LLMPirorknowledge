Going to, uh, I walk by the park everyday but I seldomly play there.
Yeah, walking through.  Playing well, uh, 1 month or 2 month, one time.
Hmm, ... um.
Uh, favorite park.  Uh, well, I choose my home town.
Uh, there's a park really near my home, and I can walk there, I can, uh, take the bus there.  And it's, uh, beside the sea, and also there are a lot of, uh, sculptures there.  You can take really funny pictures.  And also a - a lot of people fishing around it.  I - I cannot fishing, uh, but I watch them a lot. And there are seagulls around there and you can feed them with bread.  Yeah.  And also I jogging in the park, yeah.  Um, what - what else, um.  Oh, um, uh, oh, I also, when I was little, I made sand castle.
Um, I think she really did a good thing.  Because she can - when she saw someone smoking beside her, she can just take the child and go, but instead - uh, but instead of it, uh, she go to talk to him and tell him that it's bad - it's bad manner to smoke around kids and, uh, in my story, she told him to quit smoking.  So, I think she's - uh, she's really well, um - she's, uh, strict of course, but she also has a very good kind - kind heart.
Um, I think kids sh - should and the - they are - I - I would encourage kids to play with sand because, uh, there are no, sands have no shape, and you can shape it, shape them into any other things like castle or - or, um, some, uh, animals or XXX , I don't know.  Uh, and also you can write in the sand and you can draw things in the sand, and it really can help children to, uh, develop their imagination and also, I don't know, um.
Um, but they're kids.  I mean, you don't, uh - they're, um - they are not I mean - they are not all clean all the time.  They ought to be, um, dirt, or full of dirt.  They - they have to get fun; they have to be I mean they have to, um, get a lot of fun for doing whatever they want.
