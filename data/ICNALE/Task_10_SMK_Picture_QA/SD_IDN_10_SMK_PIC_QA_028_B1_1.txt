I do not.
I don't because there are not so many parks in here which are not crowded.  There are only park.  There are - there are so few park in the  ---
In this area.  And then it is very crowded in afternoon or evening.  I have to - if I want to take a walk in the park or making some run for it, I have to wait for the evening or maybe after the XXX   or evening or 7:00 p.m. for it to become a quiet place. 
For how many parks?  There are only 1 or 2 parks I - I frequently visited.  But it's only for once a week. 
Four times in a month but there are some even that take place in the park.  So maybe 4 to 6.
4 to 6 times in a month. 
Yes I have the  
The park is simple park.  There is only some field in this center and there are jogging - jogging  
Jogging track surround it.  There is only like that.  There's no fun thing but it is quite spacy and have the jogging track is my favorite thing because I like jogging. 
Usually in a park maybe I will sit or a sleep - sleep in the -in the - at - at the field.  Then I will read my novel or books.

Yeah - yeah. 
Any - any person.
Any person. 
I agree - I agree for some point because I witness myself there are  
There are some litter in the sandbox and even animal dung.  And maybe there are some cigarettes - cigarettes or - and some rubbish - rubbish things there.  And it - it is not cleaned frequently.  And yeah, I think the sandbox should be removed from the park and replaced with any  
With something else.
