Okay.
Yes.
No, I've never been that kind of person.
Uh, I am - I do not feel that comfortable in public or I like enjoy more when I am alone at home and watching a movie or reading a book.
It's - uh, it's been a long time now.
Hmm, no, no, as I said I do not go for.
Yes.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I think, can I give my own opinion about smoking?
I think if someone is smoking, it's their own business.  So, I always despise those women who look at smokers with disgust in their eyes.  I - I think it just makes the other person feel bad.  I - I - I know that it's not a hel - healthy activity, uh, but we should not make someone feel bad.
Strong?  Uh, no, I don't like people who are always, you know, trying to be smart or condescend other people.
Oh.
I think that we should not always try too hard to, uh, create a very healthy, uh, atmosphere for kids because that way they do - uh, their - they do not, you know, bec - uh, their immune system does not, uh, grow very strong, so I think kids should be allowed to play in such places.  It helps them to learn a lot.
