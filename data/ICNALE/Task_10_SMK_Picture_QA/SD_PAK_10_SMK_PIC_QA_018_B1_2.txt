Uh, yes, I would like.  I'd like to go to the park.
Because, uh, in our daily routine that is busiest routine, uh, everyone likes to go for some relaxation of mind.  Everyone like to go to a park.  That's why I also go to the park.
Uh, in one month probably I go to one or two times.
Uh, I mostly go there sit on grass and enjoy the child who are playing there and also the weather which is - which is more pleasant at the evening.
Hmm, yes.
Uh, near to my house not more than 2 kilometer distance, it is more near, uh, there is a park which is so much beautiful and have all the opportunities for you that you can swim there, you can ride there and anything you want to do there, every opportunity is there.  And I mostly - there is also a sitting place that you can only sit there and you can enjoy.  No noise, nothing else.  I like to sit that place mostly.
Hmm.
Uh, yes, she is.
I also feel that she is much strong lady that she can easily talk to the boy who is smoking?
Uh, yes, I like.
Because girls and womens are also given right to speak in our country mostly in old times when that - at independence of---
Before independence and after some time of independence, woman - women are not given the right to speak.   And nowadays and recently about 5 to 7 years or 10 years, they are capable of speaking.  They have ability can to speak.  They are well educated and now their rights that where have to speak.  That's why I like this such type of girls.  
Uh, in sand place actually in parks mostly they take - much take care of that places like sand places and the other - properly cut off the trees and also there is, uh, spray of the - spray for the harmful, uh, in - insects and other things.  That's why it is not much dangerous in park areas.  And, uh, any recreational areas are excited areas.  It couldn't be more harmful than the local on road or anything else?
