Ah, I like going to the park, because it is, it has the environment that I like, the nature and it feels calming to me.
I think the most, most of the time when I go to the park, I just sit and enjoy watching the view of the park, enjoy the environment.
Recently in 1 month, I think it would be at least once a week, I go to a park.
I, just like what I said I, I just sit and enjoy.  But sometimes I do buy some food and eat at the same time.
Sometimes I, I try to do some homeworks using my phone.
My favorite park most likely will be somewhere near a mall.  It is I, I think it was one, one of the best places where it's, it's very green and it doesn't, it doesn't have that much buildings around.  It doesn't have that much smoke.  Cars can, vehicles couldn't pass there and it is very clean there.
Yes, I think I like this type of lady, because she has beliefs that she prioritizes and take action on.  But I think it is very good to try to, try to uphold your thoughts up.
I think the, the sandbox might be, might not be clean.  But after playing in, in the sand, sandbox, I think the most important is having, having the child, having the child ah, wash his or her hand and sanitize.  I think that is what matters the most.
