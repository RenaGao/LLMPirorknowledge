Yes.
I do.
Um, well I actually am a photography lover.  So my - my key sort of attraction is to take photographs of nature and look for interesting photo opportunities.
Not as often as I would like.  Unfortunately I don't have as much time to do that.  But I do when I can, maybe once or may be twice a month.
Uh, about a week ago  
With family, me and my wife and her niece.
Um, I wouldn't call it a park but there is a space, there is river near my house, the XXX   river which is not far from my house.  I go there in the summer time quite often, at least once or twice a week.
Um, I love to barbecue first of all.  So it's an awesome barbecue spot but it's also a very-very long area.  So some parts are more barbecue spaces and some parts get more - you know, have like flowers and grass and stuff.
Yes. 
I have no problem at all.  I think her - you know if - it depends on if - if this was actually like a non-smoking space, I think she is fine to do so.
I would say yeah, sure.  Yeah, especially if I had, you know, my child there and my child was coughing because of the smoke where they shouldn't be smoking.  Yes.  I'd say yeah, that's appropriate behavior, yes.
Yeah.
I understand their opinion but to each their own, I personally don't have a problem with it because I think kids have to have the opportunity to get dirty and you can't protect - I mean, there could be anything in there.  There could be a scorpion in there, there could be a razor blade in there, nobody knows.  But you can't monitor and protect your kids at all times.  So I don't really have a problem with it.
