Has a like playground.

Yeah, I think so.
I think it's good for a mother because  
She would be the strong character.  She - she will be able to protect her kids.
Yeah.
I agree with that because a dirty place or visiting that - that touched by kids would - would affect their body and their health.  I think that's all.
Provide extra protection in the body.
