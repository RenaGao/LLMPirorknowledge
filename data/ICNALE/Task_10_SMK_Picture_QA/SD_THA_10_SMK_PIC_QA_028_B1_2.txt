Thank you.
Yes, that's all.
I like going to the park but I don't do it often.  I mean I live in Bangkok, so there is not many park that I can attend.  It's far for me.
Uh, I like taking my books with me, reading in the park, and, uh, I often go jogging.
In one month - oh, last month, I went to the Sunan   Park about 10 times---  .
In the evening just for jogging.
I - mostly I jog around to--- 
No, no - I could not because the weather is - was too hot.
Favorite park?
Well, it was this park that I almost drowned myself in the river.  It was in, uh, Wisconsin State.  Uh, it's called Lady's Mile Park and it has this long river and, uh, across the river, there is like a barrier, a wall to - located there.
So, if you sit on one side of the park, you see the wall which is white and it has the XXX   and when the sun sets, it will - the - the sun rays will turn on the river and then it reflects to the wall which is white and is XXX   yeah, and is peaceful, something like that.
Yes.
Uh, she is, um, fearful I guess, I mean she is not afraid to stand off for - for something which is right.
Yes.  I - I think I will like her XXX  
Um, also my friends, they don't like smoking people, but they do not stand up for it, they just like whisper and talk behind those persons.  I think, well, it's their right to smoke, but yet it's not good if they smoke in the public because it destroys people's health.
Okay.
Kids should not play in the sandbox, it - it is dirty, yes, but after they finish playing, they going home, of course their parents will ask them to wash their hands.  So, it's not something that should be prohibited.  You cannot stop children from doing something.
