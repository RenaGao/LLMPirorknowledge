Yes?
Yes.
In a month?  Uh, if I have enough time I usually walk - walk everyday.
Because so peaceful atmosphere and I can be relaxed at the park.
And I like people exercising and talking and they seem so happy.
Yes.
Oh, my favorite park is XXX .  There is a deep lake on the middle - in the middle.  And - and it is also - it is also near XXX  our neighbor, a lot of people are jogging.  And they - they are going there for picnic and I usually go there with my family.  Uh, the place is very nice.
Mm-hmm?
Mm-hmm?
Uh, I can understand why she was angry and if it was me I - I would do totally the same to the boy.
As you - and my mother?
Yes.
Because she was trying to protect her child.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Oh, that sounds reasonable, but telling kids not to play on the sandbox is not that good because they - you see they don't have any - a lot of places to play.
They have to play outside their house.  So, I understand what they were trying to express. 
Or that is not really safe.
