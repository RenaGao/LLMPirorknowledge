Yes.
I just sitting here, working  people play.
Once.
Just sitting, doing nothing.
My favorite park in Japan, a park near my academic, uh, house in Hiroshima.  It's just civilized - civilian home and it has some basketball court.  Just a - just a shelter for earthquake.  And then maybe it's too small, but often I am - I am just walking there and sit in the chair and working  the people of the - the Japanese children play in the park.  It's very fun.
I - it's - that's okay for me.
Yes.
Both are okay.
Because I don't even have a girlfriend or I can have a girlfriend like this.
That's wonderful.
If before the children go to this park and mother should tell the children to wash their hand and - and some hygiene rules not to touch dirty things and - and use the - the hand to - to - to - to - to wipe their eyes or mouths, something like that. And after they playing in the park and they go home and the mother should wash their hand and teach them and maybe several times and - and the children will have the idea to obey to the mother give them.  And this - there is no such things about dirty or - or clean.  It's just about your idea to keep clean and keep away from dirty things.
