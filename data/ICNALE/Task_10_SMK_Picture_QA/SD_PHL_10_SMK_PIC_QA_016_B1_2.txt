Yeah, a bit.
Hmm, the park I go to is not really a leisure park.  It's a bit of a, I don't know, it's, it's a cemetery.  But sometimes we go biking there.  We go jogging while visiting the graves of our loved ones.
In, in a month?
Maybe once a month only.
Ah, I jog there.  I bike there.
Oh, I think my favorite park of all is I don't know if it's considered a park, if they consider it a park, Ayala Triangle Park, because it's near my school.  And there I can go, it's near coffee shops and restaurants.  So, if I need to eat or just relax, I can go there.  I can also study there.
It actually depends.  A strong lady for me is hmm, I feel it's good, because she can stand for herself, because she is, yeah given that she is a strong lady.  But this is only good if she is fighting for, if she is fighting for what's right, if she's pushing for what's right, because a strong lady with a bad intention is dangerous.
I think kids should play with the sandbox and should explore more.  Umm, even if it's dirty, they will, I believe they will soon realize umm, that they need to clean.  It gives them a sense of hygiene, some stuff like that.
