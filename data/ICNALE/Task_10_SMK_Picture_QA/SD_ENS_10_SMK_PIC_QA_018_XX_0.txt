To parks?  Yeah.  I do.
Umm, just - I sometimes like to read when it's like a nice day out, especially in Japan.  I like to read at parks.  I just - yeah, there's cats sometimes and I - I give treats to just, you know.
Stray cats.
Not - now, in - I live in Kyoto and there's not - there's - there isn't one around my house, so not very much.
In the last month?  No.
A favorite park?  Not really.  No.
I don't really enjoy amusement parks.  I've been to USJ, but I just - I don't care for it.  I don't care for the rides.  I just - I don't like big crowds.
In my free time?
I like to go hiking.
Yeah.
Mountain.
Yeah.
Well, it's - umm, my favorite is Hieizan.  I think I've been to Hieizan twice, three times now.
Because it's just there are so many courses you can go and it's the - one of the highest peaks in Kyoto and then you can - you can go through one course and then emerge in Shiga.  So, you would go from Kyoto and then emerge in Shiga.  And then we did that, I think, a couple of summers ago and then we - we saw Lake Biwa at night, and it was just really pretty, and then I saw a fox, I saw an eagle, and I saw monkeys, so it's - it's really cool.
Um-hmm.
She reminds me of me.  Like, she - now she - she knows that this is a park.  There's rules that should be followed.  There's norms and you're not being - you're not respecting that, you know.  I think she's just also being very protective with her - with her child too.
Like?  Umm, yeah.
Well, because I'm thinking, oh, she - she, you know, - she protects her kid, but she - she can be overbearing, you know, if she's your - your mom.
Okay.
Really, I mean this - we are raising a generation of just lame kids, sorry about my friends, but come on, they are kids.  Sand is not the only thing that they have - sand is not the only dirty thing that they have touched that day.  I guarantee it.  So, no, I don't agree with that.
