Yeah.
Yeah, really I do.
Usually I do - I'm - I went to the park - I went to the park alone while I have - while I am holding my book and when I find - when I find any chair to sit on, I'm going to read my book there.
I think when I really find - when I really find my schedule really, really smooth and I didn't find - I find - I don't find any - umm, any task that they -  .
There was a - umm there is a town near - there was a park near in our town wherein we called it a "garden - garden - garden park."
Yeah.  That - that garden park is filled with of course flowers and trees and bushes and what I like the most is the - yeah, it's the small - small like pond on the side of the tree where you can - our sea.  But there's no fusion   there but you can just relax or just see - staring at the water.
It was really - it was a really good image of a mother for defending the health of their - of - of her child.
Yeah, I do.
This is how my mother would be if I get to - I get to smell - umm, smoke from a stranger.
I think - I think the mother's thought about it that's why she is letting her child play in a dirty sandbox because it is childhood play on dirty places because I do - because my mother always let me play with umm, rundown places, also.
