Yeah, I do.
I usually go to the swings.
Then I just roam around and watch other children play.
I haven't actually went to the park recently.  But I guess, before when I was still - still I guess once a month.
Because I don't have any time anymore.
Uh, my favorite park is uh, is very big actually and there are a lot of activities to do like the swings, the seesaws, the slides and there is also a pond in the middle.
Yes, I would like to have her as a mother because she is very convicted to her - to her work and she uh - she is very - she is very strong actually and very brave to speak up for herself and for her son uh...
I think it depends on the park's hygiene and their uh, cleanliness as well.  If they regularly maintain the sandboxes and the other activities that could be found in the park, I think it will be alright.
