Alright.
Occasionally yes, I do.
Uhm, usually I go to a park to relax, uh, maybe like have a light lunch.
Or enjoy the nice weather.
Hmm, maybe three or four times a month.
Uhm, yeah, there is a - there is a nice park near my home.
Sure.  Uhm, it's - let's see, it's a park with some small playground, toys, and things for young children, a sandbox ,uhm, some objects to climb on and things like that and also some animal sculptures.  And there's also a baseball diamond where I believe junior high and elementary age boys play baseball.
Hmm.
Hmm.  Well, I couldn't say like how she is because I can't - of course I don't know what she sounds like but I think she has a good reason at least to sort of criticize the young man because he is in a park near young children.  So I think in this case it's fair.
Hmm, generally speaking no, just because I - like people are free to choose to do what they want so long as it's not breaking any laws and as long as they are being reasonable about it.  Uhm - in this case I'm assuming he's just far too close and so that's why the boy's coughing and so in that case I think the woman is justified, so that's fine.  But typically I don't like people like this.
Uh, I think it's perfectly fine.  Uhm, I mean, kids I feel like not exposing kids to the outdoors or getting some fresh air or playing in the mud, it causes kids to not really build up a very strong immune system.  So in that case then I think it's better to expose kids to getting dirty once in a while.
