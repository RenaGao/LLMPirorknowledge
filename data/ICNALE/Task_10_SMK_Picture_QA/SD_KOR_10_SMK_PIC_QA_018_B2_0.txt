Okay.
Okay.
When I was young---
Not, not now.
Hmm, well, because in my age, nobody plays - play like at the park or playgrounds and just I want to hang with all my friends, but they are not - they don't want to play---
Yeah.
Pardon?
Parks?
Yeah, I have one in my - I have one near in my like house in Seoul.
Just I go there - just want - just want to rest or find inner peace or something.
Okay.
But I think that's normal---
---because you know, when someone's smoking near your child---
---you can - you may not feel good.
Like of course, because you know, it's not good for your health.
Okay.
Of course.
I think as a mother.
Because every mother like wants to care---
---their child.
And - okay.
No, I really disagree about that.
Because like in childhood, you need like - every teacher is like emphasizes like the create - creative of child's.  So, I - when I was young, I used the Lego blocks to make something---
---that makes you create, creative.
That's - I think that's the same thing as a sandbox.  You can make what you want and makes your creativity like better.
