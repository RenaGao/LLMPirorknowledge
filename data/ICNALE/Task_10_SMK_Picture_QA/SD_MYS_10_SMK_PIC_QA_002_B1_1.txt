Ah, yes.
I think so.
Ah---
Cycling at the park um, or okay maybe I should not play with the - the - at the playground the swings XXX .
Okay, ah, that's all.
Or may be eat at the park.
Um, may be like twice in month.
Yes.
Um, okay I don't have any favorite park.
 But I would suggest some convenient park like the part at KLCC.
Okay, ah the area is huge.  So many people can do everything there. You can jog, you can exercise there, do some yoga, trainings and play with your children.  They also have like some mini water park for your children to play.
So um, I like it there since you can do everything, most of it there.
Ah, yes, I like her because she care about her son and of course um, other people are wrong too because you cannot smoke in public and especially when there are children around.  So I guess she's strong.
 For being so 
Yes, I would like to---
Oh, we have to choose?
Oh, okay, ah, mother.
Um, because we know that she cares for us, okay.  Not only us but she would care for everyone else.  So---
Um, I think it's okay for children to play with the sand, with  dirty things  because they - at that time they are still learning.  They are in their learning process.  They are trying to explore things oh, this is the sand, oh this is a stone.  So they know how that thing feels like ah, how it looks because kids are okay, as a mother of course we have to - we care for our kids and we  immune  them. So um, I don't think just by playing this kind of things would make them fall very-very sick.
