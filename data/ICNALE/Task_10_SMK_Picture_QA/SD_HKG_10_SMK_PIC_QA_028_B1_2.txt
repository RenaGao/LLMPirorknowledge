Uh, park?  Well, uh, I seldom go to the park but I actually enjoyed it.  Uh-hmm.  So, um, what did you usually do there when you go?
Well, uh, when I was little I would play on the slides or the slings but then nowadays I am too old for those, so I would just walk around and look at the scenery like the trees, the flowers like that.
Well, maybe once.
I just walked around and maybe jogged, yeah.
Well, uh, when I was little I used to go to the Sha Tin Park, like the Sha Tin - Sha Tin Central Park, but then nowadays because I live in Ma On Shan and it's quite far away to go to the Sha Tin Central Park, so just go to the Ma On Shan one.
Yeah.
Uh, I think that, uh, she is quite strong, but then maybe she is like too - too control freak, yeah, because, uh, you can - you can take your child away and not let him smell the smoke but then you can't really stop someone from doing what he wants, yeah.
Well, uh, there are lot of places that are not clean, so well if, uh - if you say that sand block - sandboxes are not clean and so that children should not play in the sandbox then there are many places that these children - children go.  So, yeah, I disagree with that statement.
