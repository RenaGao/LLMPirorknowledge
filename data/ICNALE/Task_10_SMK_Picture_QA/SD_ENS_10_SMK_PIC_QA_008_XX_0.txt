Okay.
Yes I do. I go to many parks.
Usually around now I'm looking at the plum blossoms and waiting for the cherry blossoms and usually going for a walk, catching Pokemon.
Uh, I would - uh, I pass through them almost daily.  I don't go - I don't make a point of visiting the park for sake of visiting the park.  It's just on my route.
Uh, let me see, yes I do.  There's one in particular that I like to visit because it has many - many special attractions, so XXX   park.
Uh, it's a really huge park and many people go there on their days off, so they have very special events and there are many types of plants that you can see blooming around the year.  And they have - they have a special exhibition from the 1970 Expo with many - like sections for different countries, so there will be a special Egyptian garden, a Chinese garden, a Korean garden and so on.
Uh, I am very impressed that she's able to confront people rather than - than just - than just doing and - and complaining among to her kid.  But she has actually taken active role and approached him.  Doesn't - doesn't - this does not actually quote what she says but it may have been very passive or may have been aggressive, so we can't really tell how she convinced him but she got the job done.
Hmm - as a mother, yeah as a mother or as a girlfriend, either one would be good.  It seems like she communicates her points, you know.
Okay.
Uh, yeah I think people are too worried about like germs and things.  I think that especially now with modern treatment that you will - you'll be fine and build up some resistance to that and yeah, kids just like playing with sand.  So I think - I think that the benefits outweigh any like risk, so.
