Yeah, okay.
That's all.
Okay.
Yeah.
Mmm, yeah.
By myself.
Uh, I usually go for a work   - uh, go for a walk.  Yeah, that's all, yeah.
Mmm, that depends, yeah.  When, uh - when I - uh, when I study in school, I almost nearly go to the park, yeah and when in vacation I go to the park quite often like, uh, every 2 days, yeah.  
Yeah, okay.
XXX  .
Yeah, I think, uh, this park is, uh, actually quite small, but it has all kinds of things.  It has a artificial lake and it has the, uh, lane for run - uh, for - yeah for running, yeah, and it has some, uh, really beautiful plants.  So, I think it is a good place to go for a walk if you really want to enjoy the summer night, yeah.
Walk.
I walk in.  Yeah.
Actually, uh, not quite long.  I used to go there with, uh, my dormmates, yeah and it took us, mmm, less than half an hour from our school to that park, yeah.
Yeah.
Mmm, I think she has this, uh, kind of attitude because she really cares for her child.
Yeah and she thinks - uh, she thought - she thought that, uh, her child's health was more important, yeah, so she was really tough about all - uh, about this whole thing.  Yeah.
Mmm, actually no.
Uh, because I think, uh, some things, uh, uh, can have another, uh, better way to deal with it.
Yeah and if you can communicate with this person and, uh - if you could communicate with this person and, uh, told him that this place is smoke free then I think he could understand it as well.  So, I don't think this, uh, tough attitude was good for both sides, yeah.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, I - I don't know if it is clean.
Yeah, I really don't know because I - I don't try to play in the sand.
Uh, I don't remember quite, yeah, but yeah maybe I don't like play in the sand and maybe it is not clean but I think, uh, it's just fine because - because although very, uh, how can I put it - uh, the not very clean environment, uh, does not that harmful to the children, I think, yeah.
Yeah.
