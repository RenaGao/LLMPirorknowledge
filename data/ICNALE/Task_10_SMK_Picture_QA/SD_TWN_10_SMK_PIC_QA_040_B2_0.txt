I exercise.
Uh, um, no.
None.
Because I - I recently I - I had a - I - I - I - I signed a drin - a gin - gym - gymnasium contract. 
So, it's - the - the - the facility is a good one, so a lot more professional than the park
Favorite park, you mean the location?
Favorite park, okay.
My favorite park, uh, there is a - there is a - there is a park that grew up with me, because I live very---
Yeah, yes.
And - describe more?
Uh, uh, when I - when I went to my - my elementary school, my junior high school I walked - I walked across - I walked past it every day and - and I noticed that there is a XXX  people exercising there and I made friends with them.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think she is a - a great person with integrity.
Yeah.
Both.
Because it's - it's - what she actually did is - is right, so yeah.
Umm, I don't think so because, uh, children should - should learn to - to not only become confined to - to their - the - the cleanest part that their mothers perceive and in - in - in - in this kind of park they have friend and I don't think, uh, this XXX  problem is an issue.
