All right.
Mm-hmm.
Not really.
Because I am introvert person.
I personally like to spend my time at home.
Yes.
I think like five times maybe for a year.

I'm not playing with the equipment of the playground, you know.  I, I love to take a picture of the view.
And after that, uh, see the people, see the family, see the
