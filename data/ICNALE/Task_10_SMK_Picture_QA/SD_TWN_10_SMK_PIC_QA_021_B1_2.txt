Um, when I - in my childhood I - I liked to go to the park because there is the park just - it's just across my school.  I just need to cross the road and I go to a park to - with my mom.
I played slide.  One time some children they wanted to play with the dog but the dog was too - um, was too - how to say that - I think, so the dog just - just ran to us but I - I just stayed beside the slide but the dog ran to me and just bite on my pants.
Yeah.  So my - when my mom came, she was very angry and used her heels to hit the dog and the dog run - ran away, yes.  
Um, in my childhood so I almost every day will go to the park but now, um, I just go through it because when I need to go to the MRT station and sometimes in my senior high school I had to go through a park.
Um, I want to introduce the park just - just across my elementary school and there are some - there is a slide and jungle gym and some seesaws just - just you can see, uh, in many parks where they have this and oh, uh, uh, yes, many trees and sometimes, uh, people will pull the LED, yes, on it.  So at night it's pretty beautiful to see the light and, um, you just need to walk 2 minutes you can arrive at a shop who sells big noodles and another - just walk another 5 minutes you can arrive at the MRT station.  So, it's pretty convenient to go there.
Um, I think she can - she can express what she wants to say to smoker.  Yes, it's very - I was - I was quite angry - angry because sometimes we won't just say what we want to say and - and the smoker isn't look very friendly but she still say to ask him stop smoking.  So I think it's very good.
Um, yes.
Um, uh, as my mother because if me - oh if me - if I was this lady, oh, if I have a child then I would do that, yes.
Um, I don't really think so.
Because, um, you can't overprotect the kids and they still have to touch some, uh, bacteria, so they - they won't just get sick easily, yes.
