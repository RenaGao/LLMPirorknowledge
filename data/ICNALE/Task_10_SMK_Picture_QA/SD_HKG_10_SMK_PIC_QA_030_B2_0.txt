Yes.
Yes, I like it especially the country park because I like go hiking, yeah, and it is enjoyable.
Um, in the past month, it is one month, uh - one times a month, yeah.
Uh, I just go hiking and go to Tai Mo Shan from, I don't know if you know there is a special, um, restaurant, um, called XXX   Restaurant that - actually it is a restaurant that everything in the Chinese trans - translation, direct translation and when I go - I have - um, I have a dim sum there and then I walk to the top of the Tai Mo Shan.
Yes.
Yes.
Um, my favorite park is not Tai Mo Shan.  It's the one in Taiwan, Ali Mount - um, Ali Mountain - I don't know the name but, uh, it is in Taichung, um, XXX  .  And I think it is really beautiful and the only impression from there is the air is too fresh, yeah, and which brings me - I - I don't really want to go back to the city or - uh actually Taiwan's - the air quality in Taiwan is good, in Taichung it's great and - but in the mountain it is too great, yeah.  But then so I don't want to go back to the city because I enjoyed the air there and I don't feel any sick because I have some - my respiration system is not that good, so I usually feel sick in spring because the weather is not, um, good and humid and then the foggy and which makes me sick, but I didn't experience it in - in the exchange period in Taiwan.  Yeah, so this is the impression and - and the air quality makes me really like that mountain - that - that country park.
Yes.
Yeah.
Um, I don't really agree that she may be a strong lady but she is a strong mother, yeah.  And in some way, uh, I think she is so strong to protect her son, so, um, I think maybe this is all mothers can do because their sons is the most important person in the world, so she can do everything to protect them, yeah.
Um, I don't think so because I think it is good to let the children to go everywhere to play when they're small, just to tell them what do he - uh, what does he li - need to do after playing this, um, so-called dirty things.  Um, just let them to know what should be done.  But, uh, it is okay to let them to play everything they want in their childhood.
