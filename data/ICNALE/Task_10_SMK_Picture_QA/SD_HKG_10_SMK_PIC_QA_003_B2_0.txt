Um, when I was young I like to go to park with my family, but now I am grew up and I don't actually have enough time to play in - in a park.  And instead of going to a park, I will prefer going to trough.
Um, no.
Um  , um, the theme park is okay.
Um, maybe Hong Kong Disneyland.
Yeah.  Uh, because, uh, Hong Kong Disneyland is full of the, um, characters that, uh, grewed up   with me and when I was young I always watch the Disney movies and I knew the character and it seems like we are friend and when I, um, go into the - uh enter the - the Disneyland and I think I have my childhood again.
Um, I think if she were my mother she would do the same thing because, um, she just cared about the safety, the health of his - her child and - and in - in the usual way people can't smoke in the park and the man is making a mistake.
Okay.
Um, it may be unhygiene but, um, the children can play with the sand and - and develop their, um, skills of - develop their creat - creativity because they can make different stuff with the sand maybe a castle or a - a building and it so - although it is dirty, he can develop their, uh, potential.
