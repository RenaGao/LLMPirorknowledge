No.
Uh, because it's noisy.  Yeah.
Yeah, and maybe I like to, um, you know those children are playing.  Yeah.  And they are screaming and, uh, laughing.  And of course, some - some people think, wow, it's really cute, but I don't like this kind of noise.  Yeah, so I don't like. 
Uh, maybe, um - actually I pass - I pass by a park very often, so I think I went to - I go to a park almost every day.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.  Um, the park is near to my - near to my Starbucks and---
Yeah, yeah.  The park is nearby the place I work and it's really quiet because there is no child in that park.
There's only old men or sometimes, um, mother, uh, bring - brings their - their quiet children to go around this - this park.  And it's bright and comfortable, and there are some cover on the - on the top of the chairs and it won't get wet, yeah, if it is raining.  Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I think it's very dangerous.
Yeah, this way a lot.
Because sometimes, um, especially men they will feeled very - um, they don't have, uh, um, very embarrassed so that they - they will think why do you blame me?  Yeah.  Then, they may - maybe argue with you or try to hit you.  It's really dangerous to warn somebody that stop smoking.  And if I were this mother, I would just leave that area.
Wow.  ...  I would stop her. 
Yeah, don't do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'd just leave, okay.  We'd just go.  Yeah.  We don't do that.  Yeah.
Oh, yeah it's true.  Yeah, because children you know they just eat and grabs their food and grab anything they like to their mouth.  Oh, it's really terrible, you know, or no food, no - no stuff they just lick their fingers.  Wow.  So, I don't think that there is, uh, XXX  sand, you know, sand in the park.  It's ridi - ridiculous, why?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
