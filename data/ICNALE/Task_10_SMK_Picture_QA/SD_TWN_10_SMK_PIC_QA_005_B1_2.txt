Hmm, yes.
Because it can relax my mood.
And I can - when I, after meal, every meal, then I can go there to just walk.
Just - just uh, maybe, I just walk to there in the seat or bench and just use my phone.
Maybe - maybe two times a month.
Uh, just do - I - I go there when I want to play basketball, just for exercise, for sport and I can or I will walk along the park to relax myself.
Hmm, the park near most now is XXX   Park and it is very big.  There are a lot - a lot of people in there at - at night and you can just go there to join them to play sports or you can, uh, just to running in the--- 
Uh.
Uh, yeah, because I think it is very - it is courageous, because I think there are a lot of bad people in the world.  So, I think it - it is a dangerous behavior.

Because I think if she is a girlfriend, I think she will scold on me more - on me more, because I think I don't like these people, this person.
Oh, a sand area?
I think because you are playing with the public XXX  , hmm, it's not for this play.  It's not, uh, I think anything outside is dirty and there are a lot of bacteria.  So, I don't think it is related to kids appearance in the sand area.
So, I think so - so I think he can still play in - play in the sand area.
