Uh, when I was small, I like going to a park.
Uh-huh, I am just playing in the facility and hide and seek.
Uh no.
Um, Disneyland is kind as a park, no?
Um, then--- 
Uh, because the character is very cute and, uh, and facility is very exciting.  And the building is very beautiful, uh, hmm.
Uh, uh, as a mother I think she did a good job because she is protecting her children.  And this is very brave because he tried to stop the smoker but if this woman is not, uh, mother or, uh, I think it is quite strange because the smoker is - has freedom to smoke and you suddenly stop him, uh, I think they smoke cocaine confuse woman.
Uh, I think the children can continue to play at the sandbox because if - actually, um, many place are not clean, not only the sandbox.  Um, I think if the people want to protect the children then the children may not playing at all.
