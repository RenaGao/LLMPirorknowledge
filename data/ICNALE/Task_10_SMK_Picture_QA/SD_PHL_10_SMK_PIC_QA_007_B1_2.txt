Yeah.
Uh, I play - my sister to the park and um, let her play with some kids.
At least one week, once a week.
Uh, I - I am going with my sister there and let her play with other kids.
Um, her favorite park is the park near our inner subdivision and it has a slide, it has a swing and um, her favorite, um, her favorite thing to do there is the - the swing.
Uh, yes, I like that kind of lady as he can approach uh, directly the - the mad boy smoking and tell him that - and tell him what he is doing or what the problem is.
Uhm, sandbox?
Okay.  It's the bits, I am sorry.
I do not agree with that because kids are supposed to really play there and clean up after playing with the other kids.
