Playing in the park.
Okay.
A park?
Uh, yeah.  I do.
Uh, exercising.
Yes.
One month, um, two times a week.
Uh, I was jogging with my friends.
Uh, I will say XXX   in Burapha University.
Uh, describe?  Um, I will say it's a lovely park that provide, uh, how do I say, like track, right, for people to run or walk and it has a small river but the water there is not clean at all, but it still looks good and there are some turtles that you can feed them.  It's kind of relaxing sometimes.
Uh, yes.
Yes.
Uh, how do I feel about her?  I am impressed with her ability to - to make I guess his husband to stop smoking, because normally it's not that easy to force someone who smokes to stop smoking.
Um, yes, I do.
Yeah, definitely.  She is - she seems alike my mom.
Uh, for example, she can order the husband to do what she wants like my mom.
Sand?
Oh.
What do I think?  Oh, I think it depends on where they are playing because not, um, all sand areas that are dirty, yeah, because I think some are clean and, um, it's provided for children to play.
