Yeah.
Besides like jogging I play the swing.
Ah just like I am not like I cannot like XXX   swings.
In one month maybe like four to six times.
Because like where I am staying right now because like when I went jogging I was also probably drop by the park and to sit before going back home.
Not, not really.
Hmm also no.
No.
It's all the same.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hmm, yes.
Like in this case like if you're talking like in this scenario like most people would probably like, ah-hmm, just look at man and just not say anything, just go play somewhere else.  But then this lady stands up for herself and her brother and she then say like talk to the man smoking that he shouldn't have been smoking in the first place as it's a kid, mostly like kids are playing around and it's not healthy to smoke around kids.
Ah-hmm, my mother.
She is like soft person, but also strong at the same time like, ah-hmm, she doesn't like raise her voice only thing but if I did something wrong and then she will say like immediately tell me that it's not right to do and why it's not right to do that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Okay.  
Hmm, I do agree with the saying of not hygienic, but then kids are kids.  So, they don't really like mind but for their parents I guess like afraid, they know their kids are playing around in that sand, so we can just like ask them to wash their hands or sanitize them.  So, I don't think it's a big problem for me.
