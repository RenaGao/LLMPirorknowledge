Yeah, I do like go for park.
For, uh - it is most, uh - it is most beautiful moments to stay some moments in park that you go for walk, you have fresh air, etc.
I recently every morning I go to a park.
Mostly for running---
---and jogging.
Uh, there is no park near my university but there, uh - there is very greenery in a university, so I prefer to use those greenery as a park and, uh - and near my house there was a Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park and, uh, I usually go there.
Yeah, she is a strong lady that ladies didn't do this.  In our culture and in our society, uh, ladies didn't, uh, ask, uh, to a man to quit something, that she looks strong because she go to a man and ask him that you should quit this that this is more, uh - this is very healthful for your - unhealthful for your, uh, health and this is harmful for your health, and - and there is also one more thing that the lady, uh, the man who, uh - are considered as dominant figure and if the resistant figure goes to there they mostly ask why and, uh, what is your problem and why you concerned to me about this.
Yeah I like.
Because - because the mother, uh, the mothers are the foundations of a child in child learning and if mother is not strong the child would rather go to a wrong ways.  And if mother is strong, she bring him back from wrong ways to the right ways.
Uh, when we see upon the ancient, uh, things that, uh, the children always play in sands and - and play in dirty areas, but they are not got fallen down or they - that has affected.  Now, we are conscious that our babies or our childs would - would be harmed by these things.  These things are natural and the natural things always, uh, look fine to you and always give you health and give you, uh, inner player.  And that inner player will make you strong.
