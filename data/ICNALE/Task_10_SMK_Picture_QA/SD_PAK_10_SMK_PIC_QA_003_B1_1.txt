Yes.
Because, uh, that place is, uh, much more beautiful and our mind diverts from our, uh, stressed and study, etcetera, that have, uh, running in our mind, like we think about, uh, the stress of studies, we think about the, uh, our jobs.  And when we go to the park we saw the different peoples - different childs playing with each other and have some fun for the few times.
Uh, two to three times.
Uh---
I sit there and observe the things, observe the nature of the beauty, the grass, trees, flowers and the childrens that are playing with each other, their noise, their way of laughing, their way of playing, that impress me a lot.
Uh, there is a, uh, park near to my house and, uh, whenever I go there - mostly I go there in the evening time and whenever I go there, there are, mmm, many childrens, uh, different, uh, people that come there and, uh, they mostly spend their time, uh, over that park.  There are some, uh, uh, grasses, different trees, hmm.
Yeah.
Uh, I think that every girl, every man should be like this, whenever there is around us, uh, boy or a girl who smokes we have to stop it, we have to talk them that it - smoking is injurious to our health, it affects our lungs.  And day by day affects our whole life so---
---we have to permit that they stop smoking.
Yes.
Of course, uh, if our friend, uh, think that this is not good for health then - uh, around me there are many peoples that didn't use these things and in our - uh, like in our home, mother stops the childrens above us and all other, uh, their childrens to stop from bad habits.
So, it affects us.
Uh, kids have to - because - kids have to play with the mud sometimes.  I agree that the land sometimes didn't clean but it doesn't mean it effects on the life of the children.  It is a time of joy and, uh, every kid have a right to play, uh, with, mmm, whatever they want.
