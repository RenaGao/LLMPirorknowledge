Yes.
Ah, I like going to the park.  No, I don't like.  Now, I don't like.
I actually don't like going outside now, because it's really polluted and a lot of people are there.  And I don't like that.
Ah, it's very polluted.  I mean, I guess some parks aren't.  But to be honest, it's really not good, especially here in Manila though I, I went to a park somewhere in the province.  It's good there.  It's like fresh air and stuff.  But here in Manila, parks here aren't really advisable to go to.
My favorite park was, it's a simple playground where a lot of kids go, because I get to bring my nephews a lot of times and, and fresh air, that would, that would be my favorite park.  But my favorite park I guess is somewhere far away from here, the, the urbanized place.  I really don't like a lot of people with me.  And that's what I like about the parks there.
Yes.
I do. I really like this type of lady  
Ah, she saw what's wrong and she confronted people.  Ah, most of the time, sometimes I do, also do not confront people when they are wrong and she did it.  And I like really, like people like that, because they are not shy to tell people that they are wrong, to tell you that you are wrong.  And we really need a lot of people like that now, especially to tell people that, to stop doing that, because it's wrong.
Excuse me?
Yeah, you should not play at the sandbox since it's not clean.  I did notice it.  I know this is a sign or something.  But that's why I don't like going to parks.  Yeah, sometimes it's not clean.
