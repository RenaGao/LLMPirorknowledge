Hmm, nope.
Um, I hate dirts.
No.  Not exactly.
Um.
Uh, was some park - uh, some - some parks nearby the harbor because I live - uh, live in, uh, Hong Kong island, there's some parks nearby, uh, along the harbor side, um, some dog owners they will walk their dogs there.  And they will, um, run along the harbor, so I think that kind of parks I will say.
Uh-hmm.
Oh yes, she is strong and I think she is, um, she is a tough one I will say because if I met people like uncle John here with some, um, beard and with his cigarette on I would somehow afraid of him, afraid that he might be a - a bad guy so I think the mother is strong and also is a very - is a very protective mother, yes.
Well, yes, I agree.  Some - that's why I hate park is that, um, some um - well, I think what makes the sand dirty except that sand itself is actually some kind of dirt and also birds can also left their - poop on that and also sometimes if there are some people with a very low sense of, um, civilization or they are not the responsible one, they might threw their maybe some rubbish or - or - even the cigarettes they will threw it into the sandbox, because sand can, uh - keep them, uh - keep them from stepping on the cigarette and stop the light and so they would do that, I know.  That's why sandbox is dirty and I do think that kids shouldn't go to the sandbox.  And there is some - many - many ways they can like replace sandbox like buying some similar thing, toys back-to-home and that they can also have the similar effect on kids' development, yeah, that's why, thank you.
