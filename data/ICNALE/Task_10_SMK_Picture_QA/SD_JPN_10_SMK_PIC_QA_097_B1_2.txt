 Oh I usually walk or run.
 Ahh--- once a month.
 No.
 Walk.
 Ah okay.  My favorite park is near, near my houses.  There is a river near the park and shopping mall near the park.  So, we can do barbeque---
 ---or fireworks in the summer.
 Yes.
 Oh I like.

 Ahh yes.
 Umm, I, I, I disagree.
 Because I often played at the sand, in the sandbox, and I enjoyed it.
 Yeah.
