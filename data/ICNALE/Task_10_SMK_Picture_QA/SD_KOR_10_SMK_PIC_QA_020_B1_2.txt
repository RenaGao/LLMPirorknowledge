Hmm.
I take the sand or---
It's very fun.
It's fun really.
Yeah.
Mmm, my favorite park is in the next to my elementary school.
When I - when elementary school schedule is finished, I always go to the park before I go to house.
And in there, I just run with my friend---
---to catch.
It's just - all about that is so fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think she is very brave.
Yeah.
Because I am shy.
Yeah.
Yeah, I just have only thinking.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, I don't agree.
Oh, I think, uh, playing in the sand, even if park is dirty, I - I want to play in sand and the most important thing is, uh, when you finish, cleaning is very - in house---
---you take a shower, it's very important.
