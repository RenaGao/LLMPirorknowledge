Uh, I like going to the park.  Um, I will play - I - I always go to - uh, went to the park when I was young after I doing, uh - finish my - my homework.
Uh, just playing with, uh, some other children but, eh, uh, eh, with a similar ages and play some group game and just hanging around and yeah.
Um, not very re, uh - frequently, maybe once a month, just passing by and then - and get a go around when I - when I was free and yeah.
Um, I think the most favorite park at the time being is Ma On Shan Park, as it's really near my home and I can go there, uh, anytime and they - there is really beautif - they are really beautiful too, so, uh, I - it's also have many childhood memory as I always go there and play with my friends and my siblings.  So, uh, yeah, Ma On Shan Park is most favorite.
Um, I feel proud of her because he - he go to - he has the guts to tell - tell the people to stop as I - I may not have this courage to do things if I saw something really not happy and to say - speak out what I really think to some strangers, yeah.   
I - I also agree that the sand is not clean as my mother also forbid me to play when I, uh, play there when I was young.  But I think that is interesting as I - well, I really jealous to some children that they can play in the sand, eh, eh, when I was young but I know that, eh, my mother XXX   to me, eh, because, he - he really want me not - no - not to, uh - not to play it because it's not, uh, hygienic.  So uh I think the best solution is the to clean the sand, uh, oftenly and frequently to keep it cleaner and so that the children can play more safe - uh, safer.
