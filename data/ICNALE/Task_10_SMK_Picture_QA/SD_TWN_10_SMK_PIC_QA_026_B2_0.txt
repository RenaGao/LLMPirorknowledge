Yes, I like going to the park.
Uh, I usually take a walk there.  And - um, but the main reason I walk there is that there are a lot of cats in the park of my neighborhood.  So, I went there to cat watching.
Um, I went there every day - I go there every day.
Cat watching.
Just walking and cat watching.
And I - then I'll feel good.
Uh, several years ago I went to the East.  And I found a park there, a really huge part.  It is almost like a forest park where there are lots of - there were lots of trees.  And only one small road that not very - that's a bit narrow but not that narrow and, uh, what behind - what beside the tree - uh, what beside the road are almost the tree.  And it's really - it was really green and I like it a lot.
Strong lady?
Um, strong lady - strong lady.
I don't think that is called strong lady because that's the reasonable - that's a reasonable behavior to - to - to - to stop a - stop a person from smoking in where they - where he or she should not smoke at.  So, I think that's just a reasonable behavior.
Yes, sure, I'll just tell him to stop.
Do you like - am I - do I like?
As a mother?  Um, it does not - it cannot be said I like it or not.  It's just - it's only his - her behavior is reasonable or not.
And I think it's reasonable.
Um, yeah, it depends on how - how the parent think and how the child think because not all the parents think, uh, children cannot play in the dirty things.  And if - if the mother allows the child to play in the dirty sand and just let it be.  But if you - but as for me I think if I am afraid of my child, uh, come - coming down with some disease because of dirty things I will keep it away from it.
