A few weeks ago, Nicki brought her son to the park and suddenly a man appeared and he was smoking beside Nicki and his son and therefore, since the man was - was smoking, Nicki's son started coughing seriously.  So, Nicki tried to tell the stranger not to smoke at public spaces and the man just - um, and the man just throw the smokes away and apologize to Nicki.

Yes.
Going to the park, yes, I like it.
I just take a walk.
Take a walk around the park and go blank - go blank.
Recently, um, this - this week I went once and there I do perhaps once a week.
Do just stroll.
Stroll and go playing and---
Yeah.
Favorite park, I think my favorite park is near my home.
And there the park is - is really big, I think.
If I need to go around it, I spend I think 10 minutes just to go around.  So, it is very big and it has a lot of trees, flowers.
Yeah.
Yes.
I think she is brave to talk about to - to stop the man smoking.
And because the - this is for her son.  And, hmm, I don't know.
Yeah.
Hmm, I don't know.  Umm, because it is - if it is for her son, I would like it.  Yes.
My mother, I can't imagine because my mom would smoke also.
So, I cannot imagine - imagine that.
Yes.
I think you may be right because it is really dirty and some children don't wash hands very oftenly.  And then they keep on eating and put their fingers into their mouth, and it is very dirty.  So, I think I would agree with that opinion.
I can't remember.
