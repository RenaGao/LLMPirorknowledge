Yes.
No.
I prefer to stay at home and too many parks.
Actually, I - almost every day because my - my home - my home is nearby the park.  So, I have to pass the park and just---
Yeah.
No.
Just walk through.
It's - it's really small park.
And just slide - and, um, there are - eh, eh, every day there are many - elementary students would go there to have fun when they - after school, and their parents would take them and stay at - at there for an hour then would take their children home and get a dinner.
I think it's - it's great for me because when I was - you know I have to go to a cram school.
So, when I look at that child, I'm like haah.
Yes.
Umm.
I think it's - the mother is doing the right thing because it's the bad thing for the children to - to have the secondhand smoke.  He is just trying to protect the children.  That's mom will do.
Yes.
Yes, I think everyone, uh, who willing to protect the one I think it's the great person.
Umm.
I don't think so.
Uh, when everything is - everywhere it's dirty actually the air pollution and the water.  If you really, uh, affect of that thing you just don't give the birth.
Yeah.
So, I think it's okay for the children to have fun in the - with this in this picture and he gets strong to - I don't know, it's good - good for his health I think.
Umm.
