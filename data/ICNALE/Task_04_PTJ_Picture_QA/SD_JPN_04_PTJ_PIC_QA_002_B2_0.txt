No.
Now I don't have the opportunity to swim and in my elementary school, I don't like swimming.
A few times.
Swimming in the sea.  So, I think it's nursery school.
Yes.  So, my friends and teachers went to the sea near my house and swimming with my friend and also playing at the sea with - with them I think.
Yes.
Windows.
I have never - so I don't have the detail I - when I bought the computer, so I heard that Windows is often used - is often used, so I bought it.
Yes.
So, I have never thought of as a difference.
  Now, it is difficult question but - so I think the - in the Macintosh machine, the original mailbox are created, so - but I think it is not so used for many people, so I think it is not so useful for us.
Yes, I agree with that because with using - with only using the smartphone I can - maybe most of them used the smartphone to research some information or doing SMS like that, but I think with using the computer, I can get a lot of skills to using the Excel or Word or like that, and also with using the computer, we can create a lot of movies or like that.
Um, so I think most of the students like studying economics or literatures.  We don't have a lot of opportunity to use the computer, so it is - it is bit difficult to be interested in using the computer.  So, in the class I think the - the class is like - classes that use - increase the opportunity to use the computer or so - so teach some knowledges about the computers will be increased.
