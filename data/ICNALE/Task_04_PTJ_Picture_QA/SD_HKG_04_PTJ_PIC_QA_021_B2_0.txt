Hmm.
Uh, um, no because I don't know how to swim.
Uh, because my primary school has a swimming pool for, um, a stu - their student so, um, at that time I had to attend a swimming class because it's compuls - it was compulsory.  So, um, I learned some sming - swimming skills, but after primary school I didn't swim at all.  So, perhaps I have almost forgotten how to swim at all.
Um, yes, but not this kind of computer like the laptop, I got this, uh, the desktop.  Um, I have two desktop, one for me and other one is for my brother.
Uh, it's Window   machine, Window 10  .
Um, I don't have any reason to choose it because, uh, this desktop, um, was bought by my parents so I don't have any choice at all.
Um, I think, um, obviously perhaps the system because like when we used the Mac and you use the iPhone you can use the AirDrop system so you can transfer or send message or document very, um, in a convenient way.  But, in Windows because I think it's the original system and from 10 years ago up to now I think this is the original system and everyone would know how to use it.  So, I think Mac is the kind of latest system compared to the Window  .
I think, um,   if you don't know how to use computer still bad for us because, um, when we graduate from the college or university and you have to work in a work - office and office obviously you have to face to the computer.  If you don't know how to use the computer, how can you work?  Or how can you complete your, I don't know, project?
Um, maybe at the school, if they can set up some, um, system that, uh, only computer can open this link, but smartphone cannot open that link.  So, this kind of, um, action may push students to use more computer.
