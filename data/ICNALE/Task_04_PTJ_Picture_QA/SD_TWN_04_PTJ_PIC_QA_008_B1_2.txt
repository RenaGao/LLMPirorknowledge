Uh, yes.
Um, because, um, there is a pool near my - near my house and - and people who live in our town can go to swim free.
Um, uh, I think, um, swimming in pool and sea is two different experience because sea is more cooler.
And sea salty and it's kind of - and it's kind of dangerous.
So I prefer swimming pool.
Uh, no.
Yes.
Uh, Window  .
Hmm, my computer is - is   bought many years ago.
And in that time I - I know - I knew little about computer.  So---
I just choose a computer my mom recommend to me.
Um, Um, I think, uh, Windows and Mac - uh, I think Mac is - uh, most of people use Windows because Windows can go to - it can - can - you can - you can play games on Windows but games is, uh, less supported by Mac.  So, I think Mac is more to do some - some - um, some data programming like you can use Mac to - uh, to do Photoshop or some - some PowerPoint and I think maybe we use Mac to do that thing.
Um.  I think, um, now there are many people who use smartphone but, um, people still can use computer because smartphone is, uh, also smartphone is convenient, and it is convenient but what smartphone can do is limited.  So, something you still need - you - you still need computer to complete it and - and - and I think people now not just - just use smartphone because me and my friend use computer often.
Um.  I think college student can use computer but they just can some simple things or they just use computer to play online game.  So, I think maybe - maybe we can - we can I mean take some class - classes to focus on the - the computer some throw in computer like - um, like - like C Program or so   uh---
And maybe, um, the deal making or some people can - cannot learn by it and they sell.
