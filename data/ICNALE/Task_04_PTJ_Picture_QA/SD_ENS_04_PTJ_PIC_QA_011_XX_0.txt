Well, that's my favorite place to swim.
Down in the southern tip of Japan there is a - there is a national park where the water is maybe 3 or 4 meters deeps and with a snorkel you can go floating and see 8 or 12 different kinds of fish.  So it's pretty, pretty impressive.
Yes, I do.
I have an Apple.
Ah, they have a good reputation.  Apparently the - the software for using the writing program is very, very well designed and they don't have a lot of bugs.  Good, good, follow-up work.
