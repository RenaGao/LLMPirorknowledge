No, I can't swim.
I - I - my mother doesn't like water, so she not often go to the beach or the sea, so I can't swim.
No.  It's so hot at the beach.
Um, yes.
Uh, in the sea, salty water and I - I - I don't like when I am went to both - went to swimming.  It's - it's so sticky with my hand, it - it's like - it's so hot and I would prefer to go to waterfall.
Yes.
I - I - the - the most - the most in - uh, okay, I - I will tell you about what my has like - it's - when I - I went to the sea with my friends, with the school, it's about camping or something and we - we took a video like YouTube or something I can't remember in the sea, and we enjoyed just swimming in the water but I can't swim so I just stayed and saw my friends swim.
Yes.
Window   machine.
Uh, because Mac is so expensive.
Yes.
Uh, Mac I always like uh, it's different because in MacBook, it can convert file like it's - it - uh, sorry.  It's - it's, um, for people who want to like making video and convert it to a file, so it's more expensive, but it can draw a picture because my sister use it because she is a programmer, so I think it's different when we doing something like bigger work about streaming, about video, just.
About using smartphone more than computer?
Yes, I agree with that because we cannot work properly in smartphone, you know.  So, we have to know more about computer.  If we - if we have work, if we have work to do, but we can't use the computer, so it's - yeah, it's a bad idea.
Um - um, maybe, um, let them play games, I don't know.  Uh, university use more computer?
Yeah, I think let - let them play game and teach them at the same time like if you can play game, you can also use this, like.
Comp - computer.
Yeah.
