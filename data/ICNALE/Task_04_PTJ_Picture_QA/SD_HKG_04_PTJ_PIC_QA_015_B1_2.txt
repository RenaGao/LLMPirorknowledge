Yeah - um, I'm okay with it---
Uh, I liked - I used to like it a lot.   
Because I, uh - uh, I swim a lot in the old days in the house, but I don't really remember how to swim, right, right, so.
So, uh, holistic, yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh, swim sea, yeah, drank a lot of seawater and I - it doesn't feel too good, so I - I like swim in pools more than sea, yeah, I didn't like swim in the sea.
Uh-huh.
Windows.
Uh, I can do things more efficiently.
Well, the operating system, I - is - I can do things more efficiently, as I said.  I still can't understand how Mac works.
Uh, it is pretty bad trend.  People stay on in social - social media and stay on their smartphone all day along, even when there is - when they - when they, uh - they having a dinner, I mean anywhere.  So, uh, I mean, you - you need to communicate with people to, uh - to - to make friends, not - not stay on social media.  So, yeah, it's a pretty bad trend and people just play TikTok all day long, so that's - that's - that's pretty bad, I think.
The computers are more - they - they are really used a lot of computer.
Uh, use computer more?  What do you mean?  That you mean - you mean like---  
Uh, uh, uh, I think they use still a lot - the - the same amount, they use same amount of time to use - to both device.  They do probably just I guess, so - so they use a lot it as well and they - they go on YouTube, they go on YouTube.  I think they - they use computer to go on YouTube now, not a smartphone so I think, uh, they use both devices - invest both - invest equal amount of time to both devices.
