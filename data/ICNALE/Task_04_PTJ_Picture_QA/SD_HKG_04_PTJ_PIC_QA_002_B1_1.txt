Thank you.
Oh yes, I'd really like to.
Uh, because I was little I - my father will like to take me and my sister go to the beach and, uh, we always play in there so I really like the swimming.
Um, um, I think, um, I remember one time but my father in the cyclone have a beach, eh, called - eh, called, uh, this is something enough and he catch up a jellyfish to me to see.  I think this is really - uh, I think is really interesting because I never - is really see the jellyfish because I really like to see the Discover   channel, eh, I really like to see animal.  I like - I really like the animal under the sea.  So when my father give me a real jellyfish I feel, wow, this is so, eh, we - it is in my mind, so, eh, the memory is in my mind.  I think it's really important thing I get in this memory.
Yes.  I buy the Mac in - in last - next - eh in - I take it - I am - in next day.
Uh, because it's really relative.  I - I like big computer in my own room and I can, eh - I can on my bed to see the computer.
Uh, I think Mac is more easy to use and - and the - the cover page is, eh, really simple but Window   is you - I think if you see in the Window   you think it's hard to use, eh, and many thing on that so I don't like it.
Hmm, I - I don't think this is a bad thing because, eh, using iPhone is more easy and more faster, eh, to do more thing.  Use iPhone is a - you can, eh, use it anytime but computer you cannot, eh, maybe I - I want to have a message with other, I cannot put in the computer and talk with them.  So using, uh, eh, using phone to - I think using phone is more easy thing and this is more, uh, more - uh, more - more can I do than computer.  So I think this is not the bad thing.
Uh,  , more use computer, oh, suggestion.  I shouldn't know.  I think, eh, we can in the class - we can more go to computer room to, eh, have a class, do not - in the basic room, so people can - student can more use computer I think.  I don't know.
