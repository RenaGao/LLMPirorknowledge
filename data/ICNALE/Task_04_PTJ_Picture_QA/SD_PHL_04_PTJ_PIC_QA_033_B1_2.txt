A Windows machine sir.
Because I am more much more familiar with a Windows machine than a Mac machine because, as I grew up, ah Windows machine was there to teach me all about the basics of computers.

Umm I think that I agree with the with the people because when you are using a phone, you usually get distracted by the apps that you normally use when you are not working or studying.  But when you are using a computer, you can better sort out what notifications would come across your computer and you can better focus on what you are doing or studying?
Umm the I the university could implement more technology in their curriculum of teaching students.
