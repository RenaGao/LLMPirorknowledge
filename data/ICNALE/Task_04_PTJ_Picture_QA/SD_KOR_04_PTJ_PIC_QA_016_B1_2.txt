Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I - yeah I---
Yeah, my favorite sport is swimming.
Uh, I learned my swimming skills when I was elementary school student.
And I actually, uh, trying to be as a professional swimmer.
So I swim, uh, like for a long time.
But accidentally, I got injured.
So, I have no chance to, uh, stay longer with the swimming.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Well, uh, the most obvious fact, the difference between, uh, swimming in the ocean and, uh, swimming in the swimming pool is, the, uh, wave.  The wave exist - existence in the ocean, the beach, I would say, it's much more difficult to swimming in the pool.
Because swimming pool is more - mainly focused on the - the people who wanna, uh, learn how to swim from their very beginning level.
Yeah, so, uh, swimming in the ocean is quite tough and need more, uh, encouragement.
I - I don't have a computer but I have a laptop.
Yeah.
It's Window  .
Because Window   is the most - more popular than Macintosh in Korea.
So, I just bought it, yeah.
Uh, I actually never used the Mac before so I think I can't compare it to, uh, strengths and weakness, I think, yeah. 
Right.
Right.
Umm, as a student in university and as a, uh, person who normally use, uh, my mobile phone rather than using my laptop, I think it's not a bad, uh, thing to - in terms of business situations because since, uh, technology developments---
---you can use everything in your mobile phone than, uh, laptop.  Well, I would - I wouldn't say then.
Uh, it's more useful and more handy to bring it, so it's - I think it's not bad actually, yeah.
Mmm, well, um, if, uh - if professor gives me some, uh, assignment that I have to use a computer.
They would prefer to come and work.
