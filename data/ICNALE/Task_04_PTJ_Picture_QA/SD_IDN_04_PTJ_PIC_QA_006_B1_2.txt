Okay.
Yeah.
I like but I - I am not good at.
Yeah.
Because I - I think that we - if I swim - if I swim, I feel relaxing about that.
Relaxed, and then uh, I can meet a new friends in swimming pool maybe if---  
---something like that.
Yes, I have.
Okay, when my family and I visit in Bali, we are going to Kuta beach and then we are swimming there.  But unfortunately I cannot swim in 5 years - sorry in maybe 6 or 7 years old.  So because I am curious and I want to try to swim in the sea, I try to swim there.  And I lost and I like - I cannot swim and yeah---
Yeah, I get drowned.
Okay.
Yes, I have  
Laptop.
Windows.
Because I think that Windows is real familiar for me and I - I don't like enough the MacBook.
Maybe Windows is the - the more cheap - sorry, cheaper than MacBook of course.
Yes, the price.
And then the familiar, as I told you familiar.  And then the Windows maybe can affordable - sorry affordable.
Yes, it's affordable.
If - if they are - if they - sorry, pardon me, can you explain?
Okay.
I think I disagree with it because as I know, if someone can use the smartphone as well, they can use the computer very well too.  Because I think that the feature of smart phone and the laptop maybe doesn't show - doesn't show a lot of difference.
Yes, so maybe just a little bit a difference but it can match or the feature of smartphone - smartphone can be relate with the feature of laptop.
Pardon me!
No, I think I have---
What maybe?
Can you explain it?
Maybe - uh, maybe we - maybe we can watch that?
Yeah, I think that the - maybe the facilities of the college more increase - or more increase or more give more facilities of the students for the students, so the students can - can play the computer or play the laptop as well as they who have it.
Much install?

Library and language library and laboratory.
