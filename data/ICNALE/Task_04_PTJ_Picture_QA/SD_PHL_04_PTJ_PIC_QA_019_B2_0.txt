Yes.
There's something about swimming that is both ah, what do you call this, relaxing.  At the same time, it builds up your physical ah, your tone, I guess.  It helps you to be energized well.  But there's a problem with me with swimming.  I don't like swimming in oceans.  I like swimming in swimming pools.
Oh, I hate swimming in the sea, yes.  One memory that I have is that I stepped on a sea urchin.  That's why I, I don't like swimming in the sea, because you really don't know what's down there unless you are swimming in a pool.  You just swim in a pool.  It's clean.  In the sea, you don't know what is there, especially now pollution, everything is there.
Yes.
It's a Windows.
Ah, for me ah, I always choose Windows because one, I play games.  It's not really recommended if you play in a MacBook for games.  Two is that I grew up with Windows machine.  So, I prefer that one than Mac.
Ah for, I don't know.  Some people say that it's not it.  But it's I guess ah, it's friendlier.  Windows is friendlier for people because for me when I touch a MacBook, I just go, what, I really don't understand.
It's a bad trend.  Actually, I do realize that, I stopped using my laptop and started using phone more.  But I don't think it's a bad trend.  Well, it's not very portable and it's easier with the phone.  You can take pictures with it rather than a computer or laptop.  It's not a bad trend.
Use computers more often?  It's hard.  It's a hard question, because I've been with phones now more.  So, I don't know if people would go back to having laptops.  Maybe I, I think what's good is if you give them a very, a laptop that's I guess high speed, something that is updated or upgraded more, they would like it just because it's efficient, yeah that, because even with phones, they do not have that.
