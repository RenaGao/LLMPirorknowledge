Um, yes, but I'm not really good at swimming but, uh, I'll like to, um, sit alone in beach or walk there.
Um, because it's - make me feel relax, yes.
Um, so I have been to Croatia and then, um, there - there was so many beaches and it's like along the - the seaside and the view there is really nice and then people enjoy swimming there and it also make me feel relaxed.
Uh-hmm.
Yes.
The Mac machine.
Um, because I love the brand of Apple and then it's like all my cellphone and then computer or iPad something, they are all in Apple, yeah.
Um, I think Mac is like you can connect everything together and then it's so convenient for the iCloud or, um, to - to make everything together.
Um, actually, I think, um, the smartphone, their screen is so small and it's hard to read, um, I think the best thing for the computer or the laptop is that is very heavy and that's the reason why people don't want to carry them to school.  Um, I think it's not really bad if they can read in the - read with that small screen so, um, I think both of them are good.
Um, maybe, uh-huh - maybe, we can have some, um, laptop to provide for the student when they go to school and then they can use their computer in the lesson and there's no problem that they have to carry the heavy computer to school.
