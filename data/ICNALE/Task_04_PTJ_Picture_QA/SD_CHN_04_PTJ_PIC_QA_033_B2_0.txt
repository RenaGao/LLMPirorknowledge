Uh, yes, maybe about 5 - 5 months ago, during the - the winter break.  Uh, uh, my family and I went to Vietnam to - for travel and - um, you know, Vietnam is located in the tropical areas, so swimming and diving is a very - very interesting activity in there.  So, I tried to diving.
Yeah, um, uh, at first, I was so scared because I haven't dived before and - um, you know, everyone has the instructor to follow you to keep your safety and - um, but when I saw so many beautiful tropical fishes, um, swimming across - across me, I feel, uh, very happy.

Uh, my computer is a Mac machine.
Mmm, to be honest, it is not choose by myself.
Uh, it - it is a gift from my - from my uncle on his - after my college entrance examination.
Mm-hmm, I think the biggest difference is the - is the operating system.
Uh, yeah, uh, Mac is so expensive.
I think this thing is true.  Um, students are prefer to use Smartphone.  Uh, it's much convenient than computer.
