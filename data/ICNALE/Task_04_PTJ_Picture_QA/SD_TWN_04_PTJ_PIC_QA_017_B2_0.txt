Oh, swimming?  Yes, but I seldom swim.  Yeah.
Because I am - I am not really skilled in swimming.  Yeah.
To my memory?  Uh, the first time I come to beach was my - when I am the senior - senior - junior high school student.  But the - the - that time, I was just walking along the beach and without swimming into the ocean.  So, I usually swim in the pound.  It's more safe.  And you can - you can maybe practice for swimming skills.  Yeah.
Yeah, I have a personal computer.
It's Window  .
I choose because of its, uh, efficiency in working or doing with some academic work or amuse - amusement.
Oh, in my opinion, I see Window   is more - is more commonplace since it has been maybe half a century.  Yes, and Mac - and Mac, I'm not really familiar with it because I don't use it before.  Yeah.
Oh, I think since a lot of, uh, college students use their smartphones often - more often than using their computers.  So, I think just in the right handed do the right thing and you - if you want to go to work also XXX   after you graduate from your college, you must to improve your skill in using some computers or some - uh, some office skills to - to do your work.
Advice?  Okay.  Um, as far as I'm concerned, if - if I need to give some advice, I will suggest then to strike a balance between using smartphone and a computer since if you want to - to use - use smartphone for entertainment, you have - you must have a time limit since it might - it might influence your academic performance.  But also you - you must have to improve your skills in using no more computers since you have to do it to - for - for some specific work.
