I - I do.  I am from Hawaii so I used to swim a lot, but not now in Japan.
Well, swimming, it removes all thought body, physically and mentally it relaxes you, and it's very healthy.
In the ocean, in the ocean, yes.
Well, a nice memory that I had - I used to go with my friends, family, have a picnic at the beach and we used to do surfing and - mainly Waikiki beach, if you know that.  It's very popular place for most tourists.  So I have a lot of good memories when - when you live in Hawaii, so beach is part of your life.
Yes I do.
A Windows machine.
Well, I started with Windows when I had my first computer, so after that, I just got used to that system.  So it was easy for me to use it.  I never got to - I am not a computer person, I am not into computer so once I got used to the same computer, I continue to - it become easy for me to.
Well, I really don't know.  As I told you, I am not into - but I know that people who are into computer, they choose Mac because it's probably faster and a lot of functions are much better than - that's what I heard from the people who use.
Same as me.
Well, in the society we live, it's - it's much easier to use an iPhone - you know, cellphone and go to internet on train and all that.  We get less chances to - I mean to go and use computer.  In my case, I usually do that at home just to check my emails and some documents, usually late at night after work.  So it's much easier for me to use my iPhone.  And as life gets - getting busier and you don't get a chance to use a computer as much.
