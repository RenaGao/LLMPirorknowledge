Okay.
Yeah, that's all.
Okay.
Yeah.
Mmm, yes.
When did I learn to swim?
A pretty long time ago when I was, uh, 7 or 8 years old, yeah.
Uh, that depends, uh, in summer I often swim quite a lot, uh, quite a lot like, uh, twice a week.
Yeah or so, but in winter times I.
Yeah, never.
Mmm, yes.
Uh, okay.  Mmm, let me think about it.
It was almost 8 years ago.
It was almost 8 years ago when I went to, uh, Qingdao with my mother and as people all know Qingdao, uh, is very famous for its, I'd say, I don't know how to say it, sea side swimming pool or something, yeah.  And we went to swim in the sea and, uh, actually that, uh, experience was not very pleasant because people, uh, because that place was so crowded with all of people in the sea and I didn't quite enjoy it, but I think swimming in the sea, uh, was really, uh, fun and it was nothing like swimming in a swimming pool.  So, I think maybe next time I will choose a place, a seaside without that much people, yeah.
Uh, Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, yes.
Uh, Windows machine.
Uh, several reasons.  Uh, first and foremost because, uh, it is cheaper than a Mac machine and, uh, the second of all is that, uh, I think the Windows machine is, uh, easier for me to handle because, uh, when I was, uh - because when I was a little girl, I, uh, started to learn - to handle some works, uh, on computer and I always did it on, uh, Windows machine.  So, I think Windows machine is easier for me to handle some, uh, work or something else.
Mmm, and the third reason is that I think that, uh, my laptop is - is fashionable.  Yes, I have to say it.
Uh, I bought it for myself.
Yeah, I used the scholarship that I earned in university, yeah.
Yeah.
Um, I don't really quite, yeah, uh, understand the differences among computers because, uh, I don't, yeah, but I think maybe operation systems.
Yeah.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
  Uh, actually I think it's a good trend, not that bad.
Yeah because, uh, with, uh, Smartphones keep, uh, uh, upgrading it's, uh, their functions and people use Smartphones quite often to handle some tasks and I think this is a good trend because first and foremost you can carry a Smartphone everywhere.  So, it - it is really convenient for you to handle tasks whether you are in a subway or in a classroom, maybe.  And but, uh, when you have a laptop you can - you - you cannot do this.  So, I think it is more convenient and I think it is just a trend and we can't define it in good or bad because it is only a trend and people choose to do this because it is more convenient and more useful, yeah I think.
Mmm, uh, maybe we can introduce more, uh, computer - uh, more classes that giving with computer skills to them, yeah, and I think in that way, uh, the college students have to learn how to use computers because they need to pass their exam, yeah.
