No, I don't because I don't know how to swim.
Yes.  Umm, in my province we're quite near the sea so we sometimes - me and my siblings try to go there - try to go there every - I guess, 4 AM to swim umm -  
Aha, yes.
Umm, a Windows.
I've been using Windows since I was a kid.  I'm not really familiar when using Mac Box.
Umm, I guess Windows you can - you can freely do a lot of things and when using Mac there are limitations.  And - and also, Windows because there is some let's say apps that you can't use because it's not really - iOS can't really handle it and the Mac Box security is much more good XXX  .
Since the technology - umm, the evolution of technology we started the computers and now the smartphones.  I think the computer is being left out but I really think that they - the students or the young generation should practice using computers since it is - in the future it is - you will actually use computers rather than your smartphones.  So I guess thus - some government XXX   should practice, should let student practice using computers rather than using smartphones, even if smartphones is more easily - even if you can use smartphones easily.
I guess - umm, we should try - it's actually implemented by some of my professors that's - we try to avoid using smartphones when the class - because sometimes I really do prefer using the white copies of their papers and I really - and I think the government should try to ask - still give some courses using computers especially when using the most- umm, the most useful at least when it comes to for the future for jobs so they can know how to handle those types of things.
