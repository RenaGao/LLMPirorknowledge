Yes.
Yes sir.  I am a very fine swimmer.
Because once I was, uh, diving into canal near my house, so I - I faced so many problems, and then my father, you know, gave me impetus that swimming is an art, so you must know how to swim.  So, from that---
Uh, I like to swim in pools, in fact, in - in Ramzan, and in - on other occasions when - uh, when the day seems hot, so with my buddies, I - I used to, uh, go out for swimming on some pools.  So, I really enjoy.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
Is a Window  machine.
Because it's a bit traditional.
Window  - Window  computers are machines they - they are traditional like, uh, desktop and Mac, as you know, their laptop like tabs and etcetera.
Yes.
Well, I don't think so it's a bad trend because you have to know walk with the flow of time.  It's a modern era.  So, it's a - it - it - it's a time of smart work, not it's a time of hard work.  So, when you can do your work on the Smartphone, then why should you use a desktop or you - why should you sit in front of laptop?  You can simply pocket a Smartphone and can use it when you need.
I think it is - it - this idea or this, uh, trend has been infused in the DNA of university students.  They - they don't simply quit some habits that they have habituated.  So, uh, I don't think so they can, uh, quit this habit of using Smartphones.
Because it's damn easy for them, uh, to use Smartphones and simply to chat on WhatsApp and use Facebook.  So, they - they simply can't enjoy such type of facilities on other sources like desktop so easily.
