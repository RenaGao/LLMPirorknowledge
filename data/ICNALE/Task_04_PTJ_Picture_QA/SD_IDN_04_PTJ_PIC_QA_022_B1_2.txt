Yes.
Yes.
Uh, yes.
Yes, I like swimming but I cannot actually do great, you know like  .
Yes.  Yes.
I just feel - I just like the feel of water in my skin.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Not even once.
In swimming pool.
Okay.  So, when I was in kindergarten, my family took me to a big swimming pool in my hometown and that is my first time going there.
Unfortunately, because I am not being very careful, I drowned.
Yes.
In the swimming pool.
So, it is a big swimming pool but it's kind of you divide between---
Yes, the shallow water and the deep water.
 And I drifted off to the deep water and I drowned there.
About one minute.
Yes, my mother actually saw me drowned in the pool and she ask my brother to quickly save me.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
It's a Windows computer.
First of all, because it is cheaper and second of all because it is uh, the operating system that is mostly used in my town.
Yes.
Yes.
Umm.
The interface and I usually differentiate between, what is it, Windows and Mac based on their exclusivity.
yes, because you know Mac, they have some exclusive apps that only work on Mac but Windows  
Yes.  That does not work on Windows.
Yes.
Yes.
Only one.
No.
Because I think that both of them bring their own usefulness.
So, it's like you cannot exactly do your assignment on smartphone.
But on the other hand, you cannot exactly enjoy watching a movie on a smartphone, so you decide.
Yes different functionality.
Can you repeat the question again sir?
Yes.
I think that there is really nothing that the lecturer can do because after all it depends on how familiar you are with the devices.  If you are more familiar with the smartphones, I think that it will be more easier for you to use smartphones in doing your assignments rather than using laptop.  So, I think it goes better  
Yes, it depends
