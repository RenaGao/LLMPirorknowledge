I used to like it when I was a child.  I think in the primarin   school, but after I learned that there are so many diseases and - in a swimming pool and there are lot of disgusting thing in the pool, so I didn't go to swimmings in that.
Um, there is no, uh - not really has a reason but my mom forced me to swim, so she found me a coach to taught - to teach me how to swim so it is like the I think twice a week so.
Yeah.
Uh, yes, also in my childhood then I used to go to the beach with my family and we did sand castle and I hesitantly drink the seawater and found it very salty, yes.
Yes, I have a MacBook.
Yes because I - before I came to, uh, this college I used to study architecture in other university, so I think, uh, I have to buy a notebook for - for the drawings, you know, yes.  And the reason I didn't chose - didn't choose Window   is because the - the hardware of MacBook is more durable and more powerful than Window   so I chose MacBook.
The biggest disferen   is first the hardware is more powerful, yeah--- 
That the Mac has more powerful hardware and the difference I think is the ability to play the game so - so many games, uh, they launch in the Window   but they are not available in MacBook so I think is the biggest difference.
You mean people don't want to use computer?
Hmm.  I - well, I don't really think so because everyone in college, they use smartphone, then they use computer but they are good at both devices I think.  This is not a point to be concerned, I think.
Hmm, I think the professor or lecturers should allow student to use their notebook during their lesson because some of them are prohibit them to use the computer because, uh, they think that computer is a distracting, uh, device for the student, so, uh, I think they can be more open-minded to them - us use the computer.
