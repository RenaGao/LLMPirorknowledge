A-a perhaps no because I can't.
Yes, of course.
I have tried to learn how to swim, but I tend to keep drowning and drowning.  And it's very salty literally.  And I tend to hate whenever water comes in my ear and I do not know how to ah balance myself in the water.  The people tend to tell me just calm down and just go with the flow, be steady, but I really can't just calm down when I am drowning under the sea, you know.  And I tend to go out with my relatives usually with the church members something like that, church outing, family outing.  Yeah so.
A-a-a yeah yeah.
It's Windows.
Windows is more operative and it's been my choice of operating system since I was young because Mac is quite has limited capabilities rather than Windows, because in Windows, I can modify lot of things in Windows.  But in terms of security, perhaps, Mac is better.
Hmm.
Hmm.  Some people can't use smartphones.  What  
Computers.  What I think about it is they have to adapt to the evolution of society in order to maintain their sustenance of life because they can't go on with the society that we are in right now if they have not been modernized by our ah culture or yeah society.
Ah, in terms of academic purposes, I think that ah young students ah are supposed to be allowed using these mediums for academic purposes, although there has to be a limit for using it and monitoring perhaps.  But this is my suggestions, they have to elaborate a plan about students using computer their smartphones in terms of academic purposes, and the government has to provide that those facilities because we pay them.
