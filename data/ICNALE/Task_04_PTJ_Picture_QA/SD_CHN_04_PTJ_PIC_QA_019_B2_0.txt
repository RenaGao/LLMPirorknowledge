Um, as a matter of fact, I cannot swim.
Yeah.
Um, actually my hometown back in China is, um - it's little - really my hometown is very similar to Kobe.
Yeah.
So it's - can I say it?  Sorry.
Yeah, yeah.  It's uh, can I say this city, it's okay?
Uh, it's Dalian.  So, it's really, uh, similar - similar to Kobe with the mountain, the sea.  So, I often - I often go to the beach.  I often go to the sea, but I don't swim there.  I just wandering on the beach.
Yeah.
Yes, of course.
Uh, Mac.
Uh, well, uh, back in college I used a Windows one but it's really heavy and the battery is not really, very good.  Uh, to be honest the system when you use it for many years and the system just go down.
Uh, I think it's the weight.
Yeah, because you have to carry it around.
Yeah, but um - but for me, as I was, uh, I bought my Windows machine back then, there were no, uh, really like thing and portable Windows machines back then.  Yeah, there were - yeah, there are now - they are portable Windows machine.  Hmm, I think maybe the - the system.
As use, uh, smartphones.
Uh, um, well, I don't think it's a bad trend, but I - I also don't think that not using computers or at all is good, um, because you - um, you won't carry a computer all - uh, everywhere you go.  And when the smartphones are really, um, convenient.  You can do a lot of things on them, and maybe when emergency occurs, you can use it to, uh, complete that Word or Excel, but when it's really serious and you have to do it, uh, with cautions, maybe I think computer is the best for this.
Uh, um, um, work often, um.
What would teachers do?  Um, ... uh, maybe, uh, the teachers are strict - uh, precisely strict with, um, uh, Word and Excel, um, uh, um, with the - the size of the words, the size of the font something like that, um, a smartphone will be not that convenient.
