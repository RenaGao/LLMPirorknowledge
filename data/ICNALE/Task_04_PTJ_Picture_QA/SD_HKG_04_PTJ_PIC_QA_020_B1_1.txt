Um, no, I think I may not like to swim.
Um, because I do not know how to swim.  And, also, I think, uh, swim - the spot of swim is not suitable for me.  Yes.
Uh,   I think - um, let me remem - memorize.
Because it's, uh, many years ago.
And, I swim with my friends and families also and, um, I don't like swim is because I think there is other kinds of sports that are better than swimming, I think.  Yes.
Yes, I have a computer.
Uh, uh, an Apple, Mac.
Yes.
Choose Apple?
Um, because it's the - I - I see the booth at our school and Apple is the - uh, have many functions and it - there are, uh - the brand is popular and the functions are normally suitable for students.
Um, the difference maybe, uh, is the CPU system because, uh, when you have a Window   computer there is a - uh, um, most likely it will be large than an Apple and it's - uh, the Apple is more portable and when - uh, when use the Window   computer you need to, um, press the button on a CPU that kind of stuff.  And you - when you use an Apple and just press the button on the keyboard.
Um,   I think, uh, someone think use the smartphone is, uh - is - sometimes maybe, uh, more useful for them to access to some - to - to some of the Internet rather than they bring a notebook that is, uh, that cause that weighted, uh, some - some kilograms. And I think maybe it is heavier than using the smartphone when they bring to school, um.
