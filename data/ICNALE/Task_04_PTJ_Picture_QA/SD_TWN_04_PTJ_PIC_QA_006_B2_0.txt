Yes, I like to swim.
Because usually when I go to swim, it is a hot day and so I can get cool in the ocean.
Hmm, oh that's, so I will go - since I last go to swimming in the sea.  That's - that's pretty cool and I can see many fish down the sea, because the sea is very clean.
Hmm, last summer vacation.
Yes, I have a computer.
It's Window machine.
Uh, I didn't choose it.  My parents choose it.  I think they choose this computer, because it's cheap.
I can't tell you the difference between the Windows and the Macintosh, because I haven't used the computer instead of the Windows one.
I think this idea is very - it's true to me, because I like to use the smartphone instead of computers and I also discovered that I can't use my computers very well such as use PowerPoint or Word.  I don't - actually I don't know how to use them very well.
Hmm, I think college can just make some rule that prohibit students from using smartphone.
Hmm, tell students they can't use smartphone in class and they have to bring a computer if they have.
