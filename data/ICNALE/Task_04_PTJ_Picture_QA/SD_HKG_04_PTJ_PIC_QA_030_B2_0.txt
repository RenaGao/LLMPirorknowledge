Uh-hmm.
No, I don't like to swim.
Um, I know swimming but I don't like swimming pool because the water there may hurts my skin because I'll get allergy.
Yes.  But then, um, actually I not really hates beach but I think my swimming skills is a little bit dangerous to swim in the sea, so I don't really like swimming.
Uh-hmm.
Yes, I have it.
Um, it's great because, um, I had it in - where - um, mainly in Thailand, I forgot the name.
Yeah.  Um, I think it's quite good out of my expectation, you know, sea water quality is better than in Hong Kong.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Mac machine.
Yes.  Um, the first one is because brand, um, because I like Apple very much.
Uh-huh.  Because it is stylish, yes the first one.  And then the second one is, I got iPhone and I got iPad so it is better to have a computer running Mac OS, so they can match together and do something more between the devices.  And the third one is I think Mac OS is - is more stable than Windows somehow, and yeah, I like it, the style.
Um, the way how they present the apps, yeah.  Like in Windows they are just the normal, um, software but in Apple it is like an application, yeah, no matter in phone or in Mac OS you can see it is application.  Yeah, it is - that the logic is a little bit different I think.
Um, um, in some kind I agree with that because using computer can make the things more detailed, like when we're using - making a document, um, if we type in the mobile phone, I think it is very hard for me to adjust the phones or other design in my document.  Um, but when we use the computer, the mon is better, bigger and what you can do can be like more complicated so your work will be better than you have done in the mobile phones.
Um, like, um, the first one I think would be the teachers can stop people using mobile phone at class first.
So, maybe, um, they can stop using the screen too.  So, you - they can force the people to use their all electronic gadgets to watch the PowerPoints and then listen to the professors for their lectures and then I think this is one way because listening is more important than looking in to the PowerPoint.  Yeah, so - ac - actually and you can urge them to listen more but also to use more computer for, um, helping themselves to study.
Yes.
