No, I don't like to swim.

Yes.
Actually, I was born and grow near the beach area.
So, I had lots of experience to go to the beach before.  Pardon, about good experience in the ocean or---? 
Bad too.
Uh, I had experience that I was almost dead in the beach.
Yeah.
But at - at that time my sister was near me.
So, she survived me.
After that I never go to the beach to go to swim. 
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.

It's cheaper than Mac.
Uh, price, usually.

Mmm, many college students are not good at using computers.
I don't think it's a bad trend.

To get - to use in college.
How about selling the computers cheaper?
Or the professors give the students the assignment which only can be able to with the computers.
