Um, yes.
Because swimming is a good exercise and it can make your figure better.
No.
Yes.
I don't like beach actually.
I think the sea water has a strange smell.
Um, I go to the beach, but I won't, uh, swim in the ocean.
Yes.

Uh, because I am not very good at using, uh, the computer or a cellphone.  So, I think that buying a Apple computer is too much for me.
Um, for me, it's the appearance only.
Um, I think if students can make the most use of the cellphone or the smartphone, um, maybe it's not that matter.  But it is important to learn some computer skills also.
Hmm, but I don't have that kind of opinion.
Hmm, the professor maybe can give us some homework that is difficult to do on the cellphone.
Then, we will have to use computer like Excel or making video.
