Yes.
Me?
So I like swimming because it relaxes you and you're like being connected with the nature, the sea  
Yes.
Okay.  So I have this particular memory in my mind where I don't know at first to swim and then, I learned swimming at the sea with my brother's wife.  So I started learning how to swim on that sea.
Yeah..
Umm, Windows machine.
Well, I didn't really choose Win - the Windows.  But our computer was really given to my brother and I don't know - have any idea why he particularly chose the - 
Win and Mac?  Umm - well, in Windows umm, I think it's more accessible for people while in Mac for those are privilege.
Well umm, for - for the people umm - for us, youth, who oftenly use umm, smartphones, umm, for us, it's more accessible and we can carry around us.  And for those business - and for those business men who think that it's not a trend or - yeah, umm - they usually umm, stay on one place only, like on their work, their particular workplace.  So unlike for us, for those youth, they really go to places.  That's why smartphones are more accessible.
Come again?
Okay.  So umm - for them to use computers again is to umm, make them realize that there are applications that can be used on a computer than the smartphones.
