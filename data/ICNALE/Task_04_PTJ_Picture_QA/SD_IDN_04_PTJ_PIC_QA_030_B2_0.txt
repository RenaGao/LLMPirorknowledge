Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I do.
Swimming is one of my favorite sport.
Yeah.
Because you don't sweat in swimming and you don't have to run in swimming, because I hate running.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, of course, I love snorkeling.
Uh, yeah, so uh, me and my family went to a very - a quiet remote island.
And then, it was very good, because it's quite remote.  So, we don't have any signal and else.  And then yeah, like we spend like two nights in the island and we can do as many snorkeling as we want there.
Yeah.
It's Windows.
Uh, because it's reasonably cheaper than Mac.
And then it's easier to use because Mac is not very common in Indonesia.
Maybe like, here you can earn   Windows much easier because like our - even our uni have a - a free one.  So, you don't have to yeah, buy the fake one.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't really agree.
Because I - you - you don't always do bad thing in smartphone, because now you can do things in the computer, now you can do it in smartphone, yeah.
Oh, I don't really - I don't really know because like even the lecturer uh, force us to use some digital thing, that we can still do it on - on a smartphone, yeah, like doing presentation and send it by email.
Okay, like speaking on my experience, like here in our uni they have some public computers in public space.  But because we have our own personal computer that we can - yeah, we can use it anywhere, like the public computer is our last options, yeah.
Uh, for me, yeah, I use computer more to do our, to do my tasks because I don't really enjoy like small.
Yeah, I don't really like - yeah, I don't really feel comfortable.
Yeah.
