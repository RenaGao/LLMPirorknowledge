Because, uh, I listen from, uh, some - some person, you don't - you have three skills in your, first of all, riding that in the world time, there is a horse riding, now that is replaced by the car driving.
Second is the, uh, arm.  You don't know how to arm and how to defend you and defense yourself, second and third is swimming.
TOH , uh---
First time, sir, uh, I swim in the pond, in, uh, monsoon season of Pakistan.  But---
Uh, there is, uh, rainy season in May, June, July and out of the village, there is a pond, way, uh - that school time at 9th or 10th, we went there with the friends.  Mmm, these are some upper place.  We jump in them and this way down - near to down---
...TOH , my friend help me and bring me up.

Macs.  Window is a operating system and Macintosh is also operating system.
Yes sir.
It - it depends upon the usage of the thing.  It is positively - it has positive effect and also negative effect.  It depends on you, how you use it.  If you use it positively, it will bring benefit for you.  If you don't use it positively, it will harm you.
Computer, I prefer to use the computer more time.
Yes, I have suggestion because when we have a phone, we are using that.  Uh, uh, we are reading some book, yeah, some - reading some article, some material, there is - sudden, there is a window open that in front XXX  us, to, our attention totally move from the, uh, study to the, uh, that thing---

---as compared to Smartphone.  Smartphone easily divert us.
