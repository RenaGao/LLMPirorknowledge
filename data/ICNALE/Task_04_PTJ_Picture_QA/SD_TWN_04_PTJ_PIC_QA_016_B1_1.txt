Yes, I like to swim.
Because it is the sports that I am good at and also I - I - from little - from I am young - I was young and I go - I went to swimming pool to watch others swimming---
---and I learned it by myself.
So, I think it is some of the thing that I am good at, naturally.
Um, that is a big winter day and the water is cold, really cold.
And the wave is 2-meter high---
---and - and I went to the sea with my friend.  But I'm the only one that have go to sea-swimming before.
So, I need to take care of them.
And - but, uh, I - I am afraid as well.  So, uh - and so, uh, we - we went to swim but we didn't swim so far.
So, uh, for - for our safety and so - but everyone enjoyed it and I enjoyed it too.

Macintosh machine
Uh, because I think, uh, young people choose this.
Yes.
Um, I think Windows can do normal things--- 
---and everyone can use Window  .
But only - but only you have one Mac machine.   
Mac, uh, you know how to use it.
I think, um, for, um, most people---
---we don't need to use the computer very well.  We just---
---we just need to - we - we just have to have enough ability to do what we want when we need---
---and so if we - if we can do - uh, so, uh, if the company need the more, um, talent people---
---um, they can choose some people that do well in computer.
And that's - and for most people it's enough to do - to use cell phone - smartphone.
Yes.
