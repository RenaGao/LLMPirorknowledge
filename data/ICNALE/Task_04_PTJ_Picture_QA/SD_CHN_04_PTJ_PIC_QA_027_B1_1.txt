Uh, yes.
Yes.
Uh, yes, I like swim---
---but I never go to the sea, just in swimming pool.
Yes.
Uh, in the childhood, uh, just about, uh, 20 years ago.
In my 10.
Yeah.
Not so often.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh, yes.
Uh, Mac machine.
Yeah.
Because it's, uh, convenient and easy to, uh, take outside.
Uh, just like I said---
---uh, the convenience---
---uh, because the Mac machine, uh, is small.
Uh, so you can take it - uh, you can take it, uh, everywhere.
But the Windows machine, uh, I think it - it is more useful.
As - because the, uh, Mac machine, uh, that I used for about 4 years---
---it - it - it became, uh, slower.  And - uh, but this - this, uh - this can't happen in Window   machine or---
Or just you can use it for a long time.
Yeah, I think, uh, because with the development of---
---the technology---
---uh, smartphone, uh, the - the use for smartphone---
---is, uh, worldwide.
Yes.  Um, you can take it everywhere and, uh, connect the world---
---of internet---
---uh, at a - like connect the world as you want.
Uh, but this, uh, situation is not so good for them.  And, um, they often use Smartphones for, uh---
Yes, playing games - yes, playing games or watching movies.
And not just for study.
Uh, so I think, um - but we can't, uh, tell them to, uh---
Yes.  So, I think, uh, as teacher---
---uh, you can give some more works---
---that can't use their - use their Smartphones---
---uh, like reading the papers, uh, or thesis---
---thesis and that push them to stop using Smartphones.
Yes.
Thank you.
