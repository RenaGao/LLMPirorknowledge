No.
First, I don't know how to swim.
Um, sometimes I feel, um, cool especially when the weather is - is hot, I - I like going to the beach and I like putting my - my - my foot into the water and then I - I feel so cool, especially like when it is so sweatering  .
Yes, I have got a laptop.
It is, uh, a MacBook, and I use it when I - I have my lectures and tutorials.
Uh, maybe, needs it basically because of the brand that, um, many people, uh, wanted - want to buy products by this brand, so which makes me want to buy as well.  Maybe, it's kind of like, uh, peer pressure.
Um, I will - I will think that it's about the system because the - we - we can see display that different when you turn it on, yeah.  But like for other functions, uh, I think they are quite similar.
Um, I think so as well, because I - I know that, uh, after you graduate and you have to find a job and some of the IT skills are very important, like how to use basic like Excel and then like the Word.  So, I think, uh, there is a reason why most of the businesses think that, um, using the - the - using the computer well is important.
Um, I think that there can be like more workshops to like, um, prompt them - prompt them to - to use more computers.  Maybe, there can be like easy 8 hours involved, and it - it can be a force driving them to - to use computer to learn some - some kind of skills during the workshop.
