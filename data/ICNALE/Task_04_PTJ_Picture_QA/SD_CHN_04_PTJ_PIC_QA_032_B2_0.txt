Yeah.
Yeah.
Actually, I do not.
Uh, because I cannot swim.
No, because, uh, you know, Chinese have a old saying, uh, if you are good at swim, you have more opportunity to die in sea.  So, I prefer not to do that.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
It's a Windows machine.
Uh, because frankly speaking, the Windows one is cheaper than Mac, so I prefer the Windows and in China especially, uh, Windows can fit all situation but Mac does not.
Uh, actually I don't know because I never used Mac, so I am sorry.  
Uh, yeah, is - um, current situation is that so we always use Smartphone but not that always use computer, but in my opinion, I think Smartphone makes job - uh, makes our job more convenient.  After work, we don't use computer, but with Smartphone, we can deal with some works.  So I - in my opinion, actually Smartphone extend our working hours, so if I am a employer, I think Smartphone is good thing.
Uh, Advise?
Uh, in - in our daily work, not study, actually we have to spend more times on computer because we have a lot of - how can I say - uh, tables or statements we have to deal with.  Smartphone just have a small Windows, sometimes we cannot, uh, do such well as we use the computer, and sometimes it is hard to our eyes, so I - uh, I would like to advise the student to use the computer more often.
