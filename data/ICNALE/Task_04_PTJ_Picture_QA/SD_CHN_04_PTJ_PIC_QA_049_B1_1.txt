Oh, so I start from the XXX   and - and to swim and there are some, uh - there are some people and it - it goes deeper and deeper and maybe I think 3 meters.
Deep, yeah and I - I don't think - I don't think it's a good idea to go further, so I went back with my friend.  He is my classmate and roommate in college.  And so the water is salty.  Yeah.

Uh, I don't think, uh, computers are - are needed in business but, uh, I don't think there, uh, there are some, how to say - there are some, uh - there are some links, uh, between Smartphones and poor computer skills.  Uh, like me, uh, my computer skills are poor but - but I - I don't think it's, uh, poorer for Smartphones, because I don't use it, uh, in - as a child.  So, I don't think like I - I can't play computer games very well, but Smartphone is okay, yeah.
