No, not really, just float around.
XXX  .
Because no like particular reasons, just - I just don't like.
Yeah.
Ah yeah like when I was small like my - my parents would bring my family to go to.  
One of memories.
Yeah and so like I think it was around I was 7 to 8 I guess.
So me and my cousins we all went to Port Dickson.  It's also in the XXX   and then my cousin was like very, uh-hmm, very excited and then she, ah, the car hasn't stopped yet.  So, she opened the door and then she, ah-hmm, get out of the car which the car still hasn't stopped yet.  So, her feet like goes under the tire of the car.  So, that was what I remember the most because she got scolded very bad by her father.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I have, I own a laptop.
Yeah.
Ah, it's a Windows laptop.
Because it's more cheaper than MacBook or the Apple product.
Yeah.
Oh, for that I don't really know because I have never tried using a Mac before.  But if given the chance then I will probably try it.
Yeah besides the price.
I do agree with the statement of - it's very bad also - I think it's also for the business of the people doing the laptop.  But however smartphones can also be considered as a mini for me, a mini laptop I guess because you can do sorts of thing with your smartphones. I am not saying that laptop is not relevant, but then maybe in future like the phone can also has the same function as the laptop.
Maybe like, ah, give them assignments that really have to do with using applications that can only be used in laptops I guess.
