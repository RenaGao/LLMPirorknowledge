Um, yes.
Uh, because, uh, when I was little, my mom, uh, help me to learn the swim and I think I have inter - I'm interested in it.
Yeah.
Uh-huh, when I were - uh, when I was in junior high school, I have passed the, uh, license of, uh, um, surf - surf license I - I have to get that and before getting these license, we have to, um, test to go to ocean and to do some test to - to get these license.  And that is my first time swim in - and in the ocean and I feel nervous, however, when you, um, um, you really put yourself in that situation, you - you will feel like it's just a nothing.
Uh, um, yes.
Mac.
Uh, because I think is - it is more, um, close to people's some - for example the, um, structures---
---and is close to human structures, so when I - you see - I feel it's more comfortable.
Uh, what?
Uh, um, use---
Uh, user-friendly.
Yeah.
Um, um, I think is the, um, um, the program.
Um---
Okay, um, in the Mac, they puts more, um, um - they will think more about and how, what, um - how human act and we are - and how - and the - the points that, um, human can gets into this computer quickly, however, the Wins, I think if I learn and - learn - new learner, I need time to - uh, to know is---
---yeah.
Um, I think, this is really - um, I agree with this point because when I have the intern in a, um, news, uh, news company and some, um - some cowork, they don't know and - and they are same as the college student, they don't know how to make the charts.
Yeah.  And - and they don't know how to use - use the Word and Excel and I think this is really, um, impossible and ridiculous, so - because I have this - I have - have this training when I was elementary school and I - I really appreciate that and I have, um, learn hard - hard then when I was in elementary school.  Yeah.
Um, uh, I think if a - if the - I think student can get the lessons to learn---
Yeah and some - something can go deeper.
