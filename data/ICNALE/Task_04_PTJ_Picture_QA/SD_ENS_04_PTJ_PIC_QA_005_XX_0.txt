Yes.
Sure.
Uh - it's nice the way that you feel in water.  You feel lighter.
Yes.
At the ocean?
Uh-hmm, when I was a kid I really loved being in the ocean and I loved to swim.  As I got older I enjoyed just being at the beach, just in general.
Swimming was fun too but I also enjoyed just laying out in the sun and just enjoying myself.  Uhm - yeah.
Uh--hmm.
I do, yes.
It's a Linux.
Uh - well, it was - it originally a Windows computer, but I - I put Linux on it. It's just I have grown accustomed to Linux at this point.  And I think it's a - a good operating system.
Mac is based on - they are based on different kernels. The Mac is based on a freeSB - FreeBSD kernel.  Windows is based on their own proprietary kernel, and then Linux is based on a Linux kernel.
Sure.
Ah - well, I mean, it could be the trend of, you know, as young people get older, maybe that's where the - the future is.  It's away from, you know, desktop computers, more on mobile devices and we are less reliant on keyboards and mice, more reliant either on our actual fingers or could be some other way of inter - interfacing with computers.  It could be voice or it could be just, you know, implants or something like that.
Uh, at home or in the school?
Uhm, I think having one in the home would probably help.  I mean some - some parents don't even have computers at home these days.  And so I think having one just available to kids would be the first step.
