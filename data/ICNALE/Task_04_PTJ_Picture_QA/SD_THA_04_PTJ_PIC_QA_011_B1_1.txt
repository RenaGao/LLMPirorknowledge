Yes.
Yes.
I think it's a interesting sport and, uh, you can swim in the water and when - when I'm in the water, I feel like - I feel comfortable and the water is a little cold.  I - I - I hate summer actually because it's very hot.  It's warm.
Yes.
Actually, uh, my hometown is Phuket.
Yes.  That mean, uh, I learnt swimming since I was 3 years old, also, in my school.  And on the weekend, uh, my parents always bring me there and I and my cousins always swimming in - in the sea.

45 to 1 hour.
Yes.
Uh, I have both.
Yeah.

Uh, I like Windows.
Yes.
Because I get used to it.  I get Windows since I was very young, and I think, uh, for Window   is not complicated.  So, it easy to use it.
Mac, yes.
Um, I think---
The biggest difference.  I think, uh, like the option.
For example, if you want to cut some video, um, in Window  , they have, um, just limit option that you can choose, but in MacBook, you can choose, uh, a variety of it and it's easier.
Yes, there are more choices.
Yes.

Mmm, I don't agree with it, because, um, I think it's - it's not a bad trend.  Uh, people can have a choice.  They can choose, uh, which device, uh, they - they love or they comfortable with it.  I think - and now I think maybe tablet like iPad for me I think is more convenient.  I also use iPad in my first choice and if it can't work so, I will choose to use laptop.  
Pardon.
Mmm, idea.  Mmm, I think if you have any campaign, like if you use some program in a laptop and then you share it in social media, and you will get some prize or something like this, people will interest in to do it.  It's like a campaign.  It's, uh, for example, a program for laptop and---
Only, yes.
Mmm-hmm.  Do you have ever heard like InNote, is program for reference, making - making refence?
