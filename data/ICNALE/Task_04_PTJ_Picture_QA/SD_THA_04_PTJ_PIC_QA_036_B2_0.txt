Um, I like but I can't swim.
Uh, I like the way how my body moves and I think it is, um, a good exercise for staying healthy.
Um, swimming, pardon?
Uh, oh in the sea.  Oh, actually, I haven't, um, tried to swim in the sea.  I just soaked in the water.
Uh, tell the story, you mean make - make?
Uh, okay.  Um, last month, I took a swimming course, uh, I - I learned to swim for the first time.  It's quite tough to - like to kick your feet, uh, like together and you have to kick - um, you have to put, uh, the same pressure, yeah, it's really difficult.
Yes.
Computer!
Uh!
Oh, a laptop, right?
Yes, I do.
A window   machine.
Actually, I had not ideas when I bought it.  Um, but I just thought it look, um, easy to use and it - uh, not too big, not too small.  Just right.
Good question.  Um, I have no background knowledge about computer industry, so for me, I will say, um, Window   is more difficult than Mac, I think, in my opinion.
I agree.
Uh, I definitely agree, because, um, students these day tend to do something that do not, uh, require a lot of effort to do.  I think they like doing something easy.  So, I think they might lack of - uh, skills that - uh, relevant to, um, work these days.
Um, I will say I would like, um, the teachers to require or to assign homework that, um, allow student to use a - a laptop or computer or Microsoft Office.
