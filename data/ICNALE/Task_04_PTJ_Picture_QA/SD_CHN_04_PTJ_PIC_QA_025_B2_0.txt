Yeah.
I like swimming, but I'm not good at swimming.
Yeah.
Um, because I'm not good at swimming, so I would go to sea and play on the beach.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Apple.
Umm, because once I heard from my friend that the, um, Office applications on Apple computer is more convenient and they can - using that, you can make pretty, uh, like, PowerPoint.  Yeah.
Um, I guess because, um, Apple computers, they have some, um, PowerPoint basically is - it's set it.
Yeah.  You can just - you don't need to---.
No.  No.
No.  The PowerPoint has some standard, um, how to say that.  You can just use it and type some, um, characters on it, and it will be pretty enough.  Yeah.  You don't need to think, oh, I should put some letters here.  I should put some pictures here.  And how can - how should I make the background?  Yeah.
Um, personally, I feel if you use iPhone, maybe it will be more convenient if you have an Apple computer.  Yeah.  Um, secondly, I feel sometimes, um, if - if many of your friends have Apple computers, you might want to have one, so you have common topics to talk.
Yeah.
In fact, I - I can't agree with that opinion.  Yeah, I used to play my, uh, smartphone frequently, and then I met a friend, and she told me that I can do so many things on computer.  And basically playing smartphone is really a waste of time.  Yeah, but on computer, you may - you can see some videos about science, that kind of thing, and you can enlarge your knowledge.  Yeah.
I feel, um, firstly maybe many people are not very familiar with how to, um, really use the computer.  Yeah, they don't know what to do using a computer, but they know I can chat with my friend on smartphone.  Yeah.  So, firstly, I think, uh, university can teach, um, students how to make full use of your computer, what you can do using your computer.  Yeah.  Secondly, um, I feel it's quite unconvenient  to take computers to university.  Yeah.
Yeah.  So, if you have more computer equipped it in university.
Yeah, that might help.
