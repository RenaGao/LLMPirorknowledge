Yes, of course.
Um, uh, as I - actually, I - I stayed in Pattaya.  There is a - a beautiful beach and there is a lot of foreigner.  I really like to go there because I will see a lot of people and I can see, uh, a beautiful sand and beach.
Uh, I have a lot of memory, uh, but mainly, I - I - I can - I used to go to the beach with my friend.  It is the most, uh, beautiful experience of me.  Uh, my friend is a XXX   friends.  We decide to go to the beach and we go with my father.  Uh, in that day, we - we played a lot.  We played banana boat and we swim together, and we have a lunch together.

Uh, Window  .
Um, I - I didn't choose it.  I - I use it because its come from this one - uh.
Uh, again.
Window  .
Okay.
I - I have Window  .  I - I think Window   is easy to use better - uh, is easier to use.  Uh I - I think I familiar to the Window   much better than Mac.  I - I didn't use it before.

Oh, I think so, because if - if, uh, college, uh, student have to go to work, right, they have to use a computer.  They have to, uh, printing, right?  But they only use the phone, they don't have printing skill.  If they have to work with the Word, office Word, they cannot use it perfectly because they didn't practice before.
Uh, good, I - I - I - I have a own idea from my university.  Uh, that I believe you have, uh, seminar for the student who want to practice themselves about making thesis or learning about new skill.  For example, photoshop and, uh, Microsoft XXX   Microsoft is, yes.
