Yeah.
I do actually, yeah, swimming is great.
Yeah, I have.
Uh, umm, umm most experiences have been positive.
I suppose drinking with friends in Spain in the ocean.
It was a really, really hot day and the ocean was perfect - the perfect temperature, so, uh, that's why it was great.
I do have a computer.
Umm, umm, it's a desktop computer I built myself.
It's a Windows machine.
Umm, well I've - I built it and I chose Windows because Windows runs most - is the most easygoing operating system I can use for all the tools I want to use.  And especially for games.  It's the most compatible for games.
Umm, well, Machintoshes   are renowned for having some of the best user interfaces in the world, because Apple spends so much money doing research on it.  Umm, and they are usually quite optimized for the hardware so they tend to be faster as well and more expensive.
Umm I think that younger people are still smart enough to get to grips with a computer faster than anybody else, I mean, computers are quite intuitive nowadays.  They are built to be easy to learn quickly, so I don't think that's the truth.
