 Hmm, not really, because I am afraid of water actually.  Hmm.
I don't like that.  I don't really like that - swimming.
Hmm.  Well, not at sea, but I have experienced swimming in the river - at the river.
It's dirty, yellow river actually.  There is a lot of trash there.  And then you can see some diapers.  So, uh, it's very unconventional to swims at the river.  It's very disgusting.
Yes.
Computer or laptop?
Oh.  Yes, I have.
Uh, windows.
Macintosh is actually produced by an Apple system, but Macintosh - but Macintosh is very expensive to be bought.  So, for us, as an ordinary - ordinary that have don't - don't have that much money to be spent.  So, I prefer Windows to be buy---
To be bought.
For me, it's not bad trend, because smartphones make our life easier compared - if we used laptop or computer, because that computer or laptop is very big to me to be take anyway.  But if using smartphone nowadays, we have - for example, like we have words, powerpoints, excels already invented for the  usage  of smartphone.  So, it will make our life easier.  As a student, yes, I prefer more on using a smartphone than a laptop or a computer.
My idea, uh - if we can make some advertisement about the - about the pros of using computer, maybe we can attract a lot of other, a lot of students, to use more - computer, more often.  For example, like if we can give the advantages that smartphone doesn't have.  There is some advantages that smartphone doesn't have that have inside the computer.
That's all.
