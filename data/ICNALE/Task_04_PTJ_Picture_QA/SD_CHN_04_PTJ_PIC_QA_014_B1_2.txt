Yeah.
Uh, a little---
Uh, actually, I mean like - I like it so much but I can't swim---
---so - so just a little.
Yes, I have that experience but - I have the experience but, uh, when I in the swimming pool, like 2 meters, it's too deep to me.
And so - so - so I feel - these are the time I feel very nervous and very afraid, so---

So that - just that is a smart - Smartphone's advantages.
