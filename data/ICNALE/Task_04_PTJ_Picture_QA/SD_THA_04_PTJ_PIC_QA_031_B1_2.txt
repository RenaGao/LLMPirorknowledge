Yeah.
Yes.
Umm.
No.
I - because I cannot swim.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Uh, when I - okay, when I was a - when I was young, I went to Tonsai beach, like I swim in the sea - in the beach - in the sea and then there - there was a boy - a man that I knows.  He picked me up and throw- and throw me to the - the sea, and it's kind of deep - in the deep sea and I cannot - because I cannot swim, so I drowned.  And I get the - I - I - I drank a - I drank a lot of sea water into - into my body and then my friends - when - when he - when he saw that I cannot swim, he just came to me and helped me into - into the land.  Yeah, that's - that's why I not - I not like swimming.
It is okay.
Yes, I do.
It's Window  .
Actually, my present computer, I bought it like 9 years ago.  At that time, I think Window   - Window   is the - the most popular computer selling at that time.
Um, I think the system and the programs in the - in this two brand, as you can see, Windows have a lot of program like Word or something and Mac have more - have more new program, more system like iTune or XXX  .  And I think it's suitable for people differently, yeah.
Yes.
Uh.
Um, I - I do be - because for - for me, I cannot use computer well - as well, uh, because I think we focus more on the - on the - on the tele - on the smartphone, because it's easier to use like now that we have iPad that still - many student use to study.  And if you - I think if you use a - use a lot of smartphone, you don't - you don't use the computer that much like when it's come to doing the presentation, the report on the programs, you cannot create on the computer well.  So, like, you will lack of the skill for computer.
  I think maybe we have to, uh, put the cause of - about - about using a computer into the syllabus - in - into our curriculum more.
