Um, many college students use smartphone and they don't - they usually don't use computer.
I think it's, um, it is a not a good situation.
Because computer can do much more things than smartphones.
So, if we can use computer very well and we may not have many skills, yeah.
Um, how to - how to make college students use computer more--- 
Often, often.  Um, I think, uh, maybe in - in class and teacher can, um, can assign the homework and it have to use computer to finish it.
Yeah.  So, we will do it.
