 Um-hmm.
 Yes, I like swimming. Yeah.
 Umm. Why because umm I like --- I like exercising and then, yes, beach is very fun umm when we were with uh --- yeah, umm, umm, beach is very fun --- fun and it is very good to be in there when it is really hot and, yes, it's really fun.

 Memory --- umm --- umm --- when I went to trip --- uh I mean when I went to the beach with my family we went --- we went to umm how do you say that umm --- wait, I forgot how to say it but we put some glasses and then went into the --- went into the sea and then see   some fishes and then it was pretty cool because like fish was really close to us and then we could see the fish is moving around us and then it was a good experience for us.
 Umm. Yes.
 Mac.
 Yes.
 Umm. Actually, I didn't choose Mac umm like the school --- like the school told --- told me to use Mac, that's why I chose Mac.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Umm. That's a difficult question.
 Umm. But I think umm Windows is for beginners and Mac is for professionals.
 Yeah.
 Umm. Because Mac has more like complicated things to like for application.
 Like if we want to make like how to say like home page --- home page --- there is like umm there is some applications for Mac which is really too difficult for me to understand.
 Yeah, so I feel like Mac is more for professionals, yes.
 Umm. I actually agree with that because we use smart phones for everything.
 So, even though we cannot use our computers we can do whatever we want on the smart phone but when we, you know, right now it is okay but when we --- you know when we get a job and then have to do something with computers and then they don't have any --- you know don't have any skills for the computer it   will be a bad problem, so yes, I think we should know about computers right now.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
