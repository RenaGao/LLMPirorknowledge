Yeah.
Yeah I do.
Because I have been serving navy.
Mmm.  Well, I just remember the - swimming in the sea like I was serving in the navy so there was my colleague, we were having so much fun, we didn't even wear the life jacket but yeah we were able to swim so---
Yeah, that was really great time.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, I have a laptop.
It's Window  .
Mmm, because that's my parents bought for me.
Hmm.  First of all, they have different brands.  There is a Samsung and Apple but between that, uh, I just found it hard to use Mac because when I was born even in Korea, we don't actually use Mac in the past maybe.
But, yeah, it was hard for me to find some programs or softwares to use.
Mm-hmm.
Well, it is a bad trend because when it comes to working, they have to use some Microsoft Excels or Words or presentations but if they are not good at it, they cannot show some skills in their area or just put some document they need.
So, maybe they got to train for it.
Mmm, maybe they can have a course, they can have a class about it--- 
---for some documents planning.
