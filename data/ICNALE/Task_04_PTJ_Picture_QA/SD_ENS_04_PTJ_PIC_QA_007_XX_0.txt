Yeah.
Uh, yes, I have been swimming since I was five.
I am from an island?
Uhm, because I - I love water, uhm, since I was in the YMCA since I was a very young age so I have always been around water.
Uhm, my uncle uhm, he - he have many problems in his life, but once in a while when he's -  while he was uhm, okay, uhm, he taught me how to swim in the -  at the beach itself.  So that's a really good memory I have of him.  One of the few memories I have of him so.
Yes.
Yes I do.
It's an iMac.
Uhm, I chose iMac because uhm, I like photography and Photoshop and usually iMac won't crash on you so much, yeah.
Uhm, well, the operating system is quite different, but I found - I found the iMac is quite easy to use and more stable, like operating system.  So even if I do a very heavy poster, like those are some of the size of the poster that I am trying to do for an - an event, like the computer wouldn't crash on me.  So when I used the Microsoft before, the computer tend to crash often.
Yeah.
I think there's nothing wrong with that uhm, kind of desk - desktop computers are kind of fading away and now everything is becoming just an iPad or iPhone.  You know, I've seen people just doing their whole job in a phone.  So I mean, soon we will get old.  We won't work.  They will do our job, so if that's the easiest thing for them to do, so be it.
One more time?
Uhm, I'm not sure, recently I've heard a lot of young people they want to be YouTubers, so - so for them maybe they still need to use a desktop since those videos are quite heavy in any - like small iPhone or iPad uhm, yeah - probably just different tasks.
