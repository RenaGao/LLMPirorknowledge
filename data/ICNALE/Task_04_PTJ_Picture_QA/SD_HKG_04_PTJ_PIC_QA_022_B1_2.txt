Um, I like to swim but I am not a good swimmer.
Uh, I feel free, uh, when I am in the water and I can just flow on water and not doing anything, so I think it's really relax and yeah I am setting free in the water.
Uh, most of them are not really good experience because I am always need someone to save me from the sea.  Eh, as I told you that I am not a very good swimmer but I like to sit near the, uh - sit on the sand and near the sea and then just wa, uh - watch my body, so it's not - no very good, uh, much to talk about the swimming.
Uh, yes, I have, uh - it's not really a computer, it's iPad but I use it as a computer.
Yeah.
Uh, no it's just my parents gave it to me because they have some cash dollars to exchange the iPad then they - they don't need the iPad then I - I say I need it.  So they gave me so I didn't choose anything, they just gave me.
Um, I think Windows are widely used than Mac because, uh, as I observed most of the, uh, other computers are using Window   system but Mac is only using the Apple which iOS, uh, and some of the people are not really know how to use it.  So I think Window   are more popular, um, among people, yeah.  But iMac I - I believe that, uh, it's more, uh - the system is more I think premium or - yeah, that is more better than others.  Yeah.
Um, I think that it's, uh - people also too obsessed of using smartphones but, uh, before the smaas - for smartphone, uh, it's invented, uh, people are using computer as well.  But, uh, I think smartphone makes them, uh, uh, makes them use a smartphone everywhere but not doing anything but, uh, because they can carry - carry them everywhere and play smartphone.  But computer, they can only use at home or some, uh, specific places.  So I think it's - some - somehow a bad trend that they only use smartphones sometimes, yeah.
