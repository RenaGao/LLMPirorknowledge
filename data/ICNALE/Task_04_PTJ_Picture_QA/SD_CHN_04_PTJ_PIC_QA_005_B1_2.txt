So---
Oh yes.
Because, um, first is unique because you - if you are swimming, you - you would not be sweating.
Sweating because if you play some, uh, sport - sports, you will be really sweating that's - that's - that's bothering I think.
Swimming what?
In the sea?
Oh no, no.
I think it's dangerous.
Some sea?
Uh, uh, I didn't been to the sea of the Japanese.
Yes and it's beautiful sea and with the trees, I don't have - I don't know that tree's names but it's, uh, beautiful and, uh - and but, uh, it's not a place that, uh, people wear the swimming suits and - and swimming.  It's a - a sea that people wearing the casual suits and, um, uh, play the, uh, boats and barbeques.
Uh yes.
Uh, Windows.
Uh, because, uh, when I started to use the computer, I, um, always used the Windows so---
Oh yeah.
Um, I think because I use - get used to the Windows machine so I think the Mac machine is little bit - it's not convenient for me.
Um, because you need to download the app in the app store.
But in the, uh, Windows machine, you just, uh, search the - the app's name so you can download.  You - even, uh, you do not have the, uh, account you can download the app but in the Mac machine, you have to create a - a account
Umm.
Uh, you mean people use more - use a telephone more often?
Smartphone?
Uh, I think for the technologic - technologic aspect, it's good, it's a good trend because, uh, we can't - we can't make, uh - we can't do some work in the telephone.  Uh, that's improvement in technology, I think that, uh, for, uh, our well, our students we cannot use a computer, that's - that might be our weakness.
Uh, we can set some course to help them use the computers because, uh, you know, tech phones cannot, uh, replace the computers.
And the computers have many advantages and I want, uh, big - if we say this course the - the students can know about it.
