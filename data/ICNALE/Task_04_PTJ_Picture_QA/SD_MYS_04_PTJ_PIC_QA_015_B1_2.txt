Yeah.
Uh, I like to swim.
Because swimming, as you can know, like swimming is better than your run because, uh, if you are fat, you can swimming because water, uh, water can make your, your weight less than your run-up and your stamina is not than you thought.
Yeah.
I used to swimming with my family and it was a good time.  So, uh, I swim with my brothers and then and then something happened which I found a new friend.  And it is good because have someone in your life it makes you better.  You can share a new thing to the others, okay.  So, uh, the - my new friends went on swimming, uh, is with - is treat me money - is give me money, is give me food  ABC  and others.  He was nice and I love.
Yes.
Yeah.
Uh, I do not have.
No, no.
No.
No.
No.
I don't  
I don't know the diff - I don't know the difference but when I look the computer, I think it same.  Basically, it's same, just the - maybe the software.  So basically I don't have computer because, uh, my mom and our - and my dad thinks that if we have a computer, we will be playing - we will play game by - I am not like you too much. Simply we just use - uh we will just use for XXX  .
Yeah.
For me, uh, it is good if we learn both.  So basically, uh, you can learn computer by phones using YouTube, the apps.  So right now you can switch to YouTube, uh, ICT or IT, like C++.  So I learned something about computer from my cousin basically.  So my cousin take IT course.  So, uh, when we learn something like the both, we can use - we can use them with, uh, something new like, uh, computer and phone.  You can do computer, uh, you can do or reset your phone by computer.  Like, like now, uh, if you want reset, uh, a phone, you can use computer to reset it.  Then you use a phone to reset it much it more difficult to reset your phone, uh, when you do not use computer.  So basically use - computer is more the basic thing you need to know.
Yeah because right now lectures also use smartphone to communicate to student.  So, uh, smartphone also important to al - our life.
So, uh, for me - students to use computer often is by, by put syllabus in student - students - uh, what student learning like one hours maybe in syllabus for IT.  So student can learn not too much but, uh, the simple, the basic thing about computer so they know how to, to use computer wisely.
