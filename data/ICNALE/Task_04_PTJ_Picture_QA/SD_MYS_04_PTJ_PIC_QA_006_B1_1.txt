Okay.
Hmm, I can't say I like it or not  because I haven't tried swimming yet.  But, if you did - if you do tell me to go there, I will definitely drown because I don't know how to swim.
I never learned before and if I did I mostly spend my time reading, so I don't have much time to go to swimming and that's why.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It's a simple, it's not simple, but it's a laptop using Windows software.
Actually I don't really - I don't have any particulars regarding the software because to me what is - what's important is I manage to done - to get my job done in - in the time.
I know, I heard it before but I didn't know, I didn't go to details of it.
Yes.
For me it's different in terms of style, in terms of its.
For me the one that is most - that is more expensive is the Mac one because the Windows is kind of common around people.  So, it's kind of cheap.
Yes.
Yes, including me.
My opinion is that maybe student prefer to do by using their smartphone because it is much more easier and convenient for them as they all - they often bring the smartphone everywhere, wherever they go and the computer, you need to - you need to install first.  It takes much time in order to complete certain type of work.  Therefore that's why most of the student they prefer to use smartphones.
Yes.
Do you have any idea to make - how to make college student use computers more often?  How to encourage them?
Maybe by - by upgrading the system, the university maybe they should - they should prepare or do everything by using computer online.  They do not need - maybe they don't really need to use books anymore.  So that student they - they only need to use their laptops and computers only.
Yes.
