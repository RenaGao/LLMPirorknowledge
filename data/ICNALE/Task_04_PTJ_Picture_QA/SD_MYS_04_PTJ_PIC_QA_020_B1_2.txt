Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, I think because I don't really like activities that involve me to walk that much.  So I really love to swim and I also start when I was in school and yeah, we do a lot of camping at the seas, so---
Yeah, a lot.  Lot of it.
Sure.  Um, when I was stressed out with my exam, my family decided to take me on a vacation to  samba  because I love  samba  very much.
And we go - we went for swimming for scuba-diving and all.  And I think it is very - very, very - it bring peace to my mind and yeah, I think swimming will be my best - best activities in the world.
Yeah.

To be honest, I'm not that kind of IT person but I - I got my computer as a gift.  So I just had what my parents bought for me.
Well, I - as a student its myself.  I don't really - I don't really agree with that because I brought my computer everywhere except for now.  And I use it all the time because I think all of my casual - smartphone makes my life easier but I need my laptop every - wherever I go.
Well, for me to make college student use computer more often is like really, really hard but, um, actually we can do it by signing assignments, lot of assignments that we have to use computers and also that they will have to use it whether they want it or not.
