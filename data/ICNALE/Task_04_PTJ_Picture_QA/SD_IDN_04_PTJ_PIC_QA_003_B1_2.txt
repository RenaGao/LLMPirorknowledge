Yeah.
Uhm, I do.
Because I love to play with water.
Hmm, just at the beach.
At the shore.
Yeah, yeah.
Hmm, oh, uhm.
Oh, I - I now remember.  Uh, it was like two or three years ago I went to the beach at the center - Central Java.
It - it nears an island.
And there is a black sand beach.
And I, me, I with my cousins and I play at the shore, just maybe play the sides or not - not really swimming.
Yeah, just play in the water.
Yeah, it's - it's very deep.  That's why we are not allowed to - to swim.
A laptop.
It's Windows.
Because it all - it of course costs cheaper.
And I also used to use the Windows one over Mac.
Used to.
Yeah familiar.
The price.
Uh, I think it's the system.
Uh, I don't know.  I never really look into Mac, but I think that it is more flexible than the Windows.
Mac  .
Yeah, but it's a little bit harder than the Windows.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uhm, I - I disagree.
Because I think nowadays people have to learn how use computer.
Yeah.
Yeah.   
Oh, yeah, I mean - yeah I mean that I agree with it.
Uhm, umm, I don't know.
Or maybe for that university may maybe have to, you know, just make some agenda to - for us to come to a room with full - full of computer just like when I was in my high school or in junior high school.  We have a - a schedule to go to the computer lab to use the computer.
Maybe they have to make something like that.
Yeah, more or less.
Uhm, maybe, uh, you know from the organization or student organization, they have to make like a media school or something like that.  Make just a simple one to, you know just to operate Word or Excel or - or just PowerPoint.  As simple as that but I think that it is important.
Yeah.
Yeah, please.
