 Yes, I do.
 Because I can --- I can get my muscled body.
 Uh, okay, I was --- I was --- went --- I went to swimming school when I was uh, uh elementary school student, but I stopped go   to school when I was junior high school.
 But, even after I stopped going   the school, I always --- uh-uh --- sometimes I went to swimming pool to --- not to forget how to swim and now I --- I want to --- I want to restart to swimming to lose my weight.
 In the sea --- uh, in the sea --- in the sea uh---  
 Yes, when I was a little --- little --- little, little kid, maybe I have --- I had   5 or 4 years old --- years old, but recently I didn't went to the sea, maybe the last time it was 2 --- no, 3 years ago in France.

 Macintosh machine.
 Because my --- when I was a grad --- uh --- undergraduate, my professor recommended me to have a Mac machine.
 Yes.
 Uh, biggest, I --- umm --- for me it's the design.
 Design of the Window  , and I --- the Mac --- for the Mac PC the design is, for me it's for the individual opinion but I --- I found it's really stylish and for the Windows OC   it's very useful to --- uh, it's very convenient to use and --- and easy to understand the tools like umm ETO   Word, Excel, etcetera.
 So, umm, the most differences --- difference is style, um, is design but for --- to use every day I like to choose Windows OC  , you know.
 Uh, I don't --- I don't think --- I --- uh --- well, I --- I thought many --- umm --- almost all students have own PC.

 Yeah, I --- hmm, I don't think it's not good trend because uh once we started working in office, we can learn PC, we can development   PC skill for --- in a really short period.
 So, I don't think this --- that was --- that is a really --- really, how to say, the serious problem.
