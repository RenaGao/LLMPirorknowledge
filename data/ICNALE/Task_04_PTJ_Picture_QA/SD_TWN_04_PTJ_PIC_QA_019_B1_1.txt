Um, I can swim, uh, without people and it's very peaceful and - just like that.
Sea?  Um, we can see many small fish and it's colorful.  And, uh, once I went to the beach, we saw a jellyfish.
Yes.  And it's like a plastic bag.  Yeah, it's dying.  Yeah.

Windows.
I don't know.  Maybe because we don't need to - uh, we don't need to use the very high-level thing.  So, just a simple one, and it is not heavy.  Just like it can do some works we want to do.
Control, the - the button, control.
Yeah, and Windows.  And maybe we can use CtrlV, CtrlC, but Mac is not used Control.  But I don't know what button is that.
I think smartphone is more, uh, uh, convenient as, uh, we can do things.  Maybe, we are on XXX   but laptop is too big.  You need to have a seat and you can use a laptop, but I can stand and use the smartphone.  And smartphone can do most of the thing that laptop - laptop can do.
Yeah, I think it's not bad.
I don't mean they have to.
Yeah.  As you - uh, the smartphone can do then I will use the smartphone.
Uh, when I type the words, uh, smartphone can help me, just maybe I - I enter A-P and it will have the word apple or something like that.
