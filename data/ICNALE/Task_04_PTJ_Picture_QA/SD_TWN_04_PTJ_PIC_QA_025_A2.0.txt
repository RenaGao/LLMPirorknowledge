I don't like swim because that - that will be very tired.
Yes, uh, in elementary school and high school, we have swimming class and I - I have learned some swimming skill but I didn't want to go swimming in my free time.
Um, I never go to beach and enter the sea to swimming.  I just stand on the beach and use my feet to - uh, to touch the water, yeah.
Computer, yes.  I buy one, uh, in last, uh, last year.
Window   machine, yes.
Because is convenient to take it to every place.
What's different in Window   and Mac?
Oh, I see.
Mm-hmm, because I didn't, uh, I have not   I have no see how to use Mac.  I just, uh - I just look how to - how Window   use.
They're different.
Biggest difference I think is the system.
Uh, Mac as I know, Mac is use their own system and man - many - many system can - cannot, uh, use with LAN together.  But Window   - Window   maybe is more, uh, public, so is, uh, more system can use with it.
Yes.
I think is, uh, generation flaw, uh, because, uh, internet is, uh, keep go---
Yes, keep going and it will be a problem.  Uh, actually not a problem, it just, uh, uh, uh, result.
Yes, so busin - businessmen should not think it - it is the problem.  They should think how to use the result to, uh, to create something else.
