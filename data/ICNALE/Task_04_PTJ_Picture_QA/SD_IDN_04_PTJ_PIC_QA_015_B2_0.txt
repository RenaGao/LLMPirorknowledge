Uhm, I recently get like a whole XXX   of swimming.  But then I - I rarely go swimming.
I like it but like.  
Yes.
I like it because between - among the other sports like running and sorry playing basketball and other - other stuffs I prefer swimming because it's the one that doesn't make me sweat.
Yes because it is in the water.
Yes.  
Swimming in the sea, well funny because I - I recently I have spent my last 2 months I - well, let's say just I - I lived like outside the city in - in an island that is surrounded by beaches and oceans and uhm well, my friends, my friends do - did - did swim there.  But I - I didn't swim.  I - I - I regretted it so much because well I then  
Actually I - I never swim at the beach because I was afraid.
I usually swim in the public swimming pool.  
Okay.  I - I - well, last week, last week I swam at the public swimming pool and I - I went there in the morning like at 6 o'clock and then I - I did some laps, some laps but my - what is it, uh, I was weak with my breathing you know.  Like I - I - I couldn't like do the whole lap but I - I stopped like a few - few what is it, few movements, few swimming and then I took a rest and continue it.  And that - that - that's how it goes.
Okay.
Yes.
Oh Windows.
Yes.
Because I cannot afford a Mac computer.  
Yes.
Uhm, the interface, the interface.  Well, I - I think that a Mac - Mac is quite, you know, exclusive.  It's the design, the - the - what - what is there in--- 
What is it, touch - touch bar - touch bar. Yes.  
The newest - the newest Mac got - got it.  And I think that's pretty much it.  I mean Mac - Mac got a higher reputation than Windows I personally think.
Yes.
Well I - I think I don't - I - I disagree with that because in my - well, my experience, like my friends, they - they can do computers pretty well.  I mean they have smartphones but - but they - they do not forget their computers.  I mean, they use it also.
Okay.  I believe the faculty the professors should like make a rule that in class they are allowed to use gadgets but no smartphones.  So, if they wanted to research like or Google something like during the lecture, they can use sketches but not smartphones but use their laptops.  I think - I think that that will do.
Okay.
