Uh, yes.
Okay.  I like to swimming - I like to swim because XXX   of all it is, uh, XXX  , uh, and also swimming helps me to have a good breathing  .
Breathing technique, and also, uh, it is as an, uh, sport for me.  Uh, if I - if I don't want to go outdoor I can - I can swim in indoor.
In the sea?
Uh, it's been really long time since, I last - I last swim at the beach, uh, I think, my, I think when I was 12 years old, I went to a beach at Indonesia, around XXX  , somewhere I did, I couldn't remember.  So, I went there with my family, uh, and we change our clothes, we wear swimming clothes, and then we go to the beach and, uh, we swim together and having fun, and we saw some, uh, some sea creatures inside the sea and that's it.
Yes!  A laptop.
Windows machine.

Uh, the biggest difference between Mac and Windows is the-the desktop itself.
The-the Windows are, uh, much more, uh, much more, maybe have a really structural appearance and did a stop, Mac I think it is more softer, like the--that, the icon and software than in Windows itself.
The price of course the Mac are much more expensive than Windows.
Yes.
Uh, I think, uh, it is true that it is bad - but  
Trend, because, I think, it's very effective to use computers greater than smart phone, because the screen is much more bigger than the smart phone, and I think it consumes less time then using smart phone because of the key - of the small keypad inside the smart phone.  So.
Umm, I think, uh, we can, uh, make the computer similar to smart phones, uh, maybe we can, uh, like, uh, uh, computer we can, uh, how to say - make computer can install apps like Instagram, that most people usually use. So they want turn to smart phones and maybe we could produce computers that have much more, uh, much more attractive design, so people will buy it.
