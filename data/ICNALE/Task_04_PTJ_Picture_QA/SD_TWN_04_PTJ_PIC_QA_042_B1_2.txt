Yeah.
Yes.
I like it because it - it can lose weight XXX .
Yes.
Okay.  In fact, I cannot swim.  I - I can only swim at, uh, the deep, which I can put my feet in the buttock.  If I can't reach the buttock, I - I don't dare to swim.
So, in the sea, uh, the situation is many of my friends were altogether in a sea, it's a vacation, so there are lots of people and then how we play is, uh, those who cannot swim or afraid of swim, they play, uh, close to the beach and those who dare to swim further they just go everywhere.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh, it's a Windows machine.
Um, I think it's relatively cheap compared to another one.
Um, I have heard that Mac - Mac system keeps virus away.  I - I have heard that, but I think the biggest difference is that Mac systems can connect your like phone and - with your computer, so---
Windows do the same?
Yeah, but it's later development.
So, the biggest difference, I - I'm not sure because I don't use Mac.
Yes.
Right.
I think I agree with this point in fact because some of my friends, they are not major in, uh, Windows or Office and they cannot, uh, do well on Words or PowerPoint or Excel.  They can that like - like if they major in computer engineering, but they cannot use words fluently, they don't know how to place a table, they don't know how to change the - the spacing or anything, so I - I feel like, what, you are measuring in computer engineering, you don't know this.  It's terrible.
I think now, uh, more and more professors ask students to do presentation like I think it's a - a good training---
---because if you want to do this, you have to learn to - to use it, so it's enough.
