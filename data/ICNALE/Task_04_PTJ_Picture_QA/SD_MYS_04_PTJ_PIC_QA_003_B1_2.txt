Um, not really.
Because I can't swim.
Yes.
Mostly when I went to the sea at first I don't really want to get myself wet but well, after getting into the sea after swimming it's like I don't want to stop.  So sometimes when going to the sea, it's fun, mostly fun memory.  There is not really bad things happened to me, not really any bad experience actually.  So yes, I love going to the sea.
Yes.
Ah, yes, I do.
Ah, it is Windows.
Ah, I chose Windows because before I buy a computer I mostly look at the review and so on.  So most people use Windows.  I also chose it.
Well, the biggest difference between the two is that ah for Windows many people say that it's user friendly - it is easier to use because unlike the Mac which is well it is powerful but - but the security is too tight.  So I prefer Windows actually.
I think it is true because even for simple ah, application such as Microsoft Word or Excel or even PowerPoint presentation may be, not many people knew that we can do something ah, in that application.  So it is not well  explored  to students.  So yes I think that's it.
Give them assignment may be.
Ah, mostly writing because when we need writing mostly in soft copy we need to use application such as Microsoft Word and given something for example for students like me, a chemistry student there is many chemist - chemistry apps in - can - can be used in the computer.  So may be assignment more on that can help.
