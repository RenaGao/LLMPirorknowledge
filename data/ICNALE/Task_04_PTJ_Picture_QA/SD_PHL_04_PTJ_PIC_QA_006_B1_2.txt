Yes, I like to swim.
Uh, I like to swim because uhm, uh, water is very soothing to body and I like the ocean uh, I like the sound of the ocean, I like the sound, the - the touch of the water.
Alright.  Well, uh, I am a surfer.  Uh, I enjoy swimming, uh, I live right next to the beach.  So every time, I go home to my province, I usually swim during the mornings and catch the waves uh, before it becomes noon time so it doesn't get very hot.
Yes, I do have.
It's a Windows.
Uh, I chose a Windows because of its easy to access to delegate unlike Mac Book and I also chose it because uh, it's more - it's less limited than the Mac Book other computers.   
The biggest difference?  I think the biggest difference is the interface, the interface of computers because uh, the Windows is uh, is uh, made for people who want to have them uh, more technical - who want to uh, be more technical and want to expound their uses of the computer.  While on the other hand, uh, using a Mac book uh, it's very easier for the consumer to go and access programs such as uh, the Word and the browser and etc.
Yes.
Um, I think it shouldn't be limited to the people who don't have access to the computers uh, because uh, I think uh, schools should provide more computers for the - for the students who only - who can only provide the cell phones, so they can uh, access more and have more knowledge and skills uh, regarding the technology of computers.
Uh, I think the best way if they don't have access to computers or do not have their own computers is to go to computer shops, because that would be the easiest way to have access to computers.  Or if not, if the school provides their own computer labs, they can go there once in a while or maybe every day and check out their computers.
