Swimming - I like swimming.  I like go to swimming - go for swim but I don't like go to the beach.
Because I think it is very dangerous and dirty in the beach.
Um, I seldom go to the beach because I think it is - the sea is really dirty and many rubbish and - and also very, eh, salty, yes.  Eh, because when you go to the swimming pool, you can dive under the water and you can see - maybe you see the, eh - you can look at the people or you can see anything clearly.  But if you go to the beach and you dive into the water you can't see anything just really dark.
Yes.
Uh, MacBook.
Um, because a lot of students or my friend use MacBook then I choose MacBook - MacBook and because I like Apple.
Just, eh, system, the program--- 
---but not any big difference.
Mean - using a lot of smartphone instead of computer?
Hmm.  I think it's not because smartphone just like small computer, you can - uh, many function in computer you can use it in your phone and phone is really, uh, you can take it anywhere, use it anytime.  I think using smartphone is really convenience.
Hmm   when you look - uh, when you look at some Notes or PowerPoint or Mac Notes it is easier for using computer instead of smartphone because computer is bigger than smartphone and you can make notes easier than smartphone.
