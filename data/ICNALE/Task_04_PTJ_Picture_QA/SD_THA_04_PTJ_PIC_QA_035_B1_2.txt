I like it but I can't swim.
I like it into water and refreshed.  Uh, that's one skill that I have always wanted to have.  I just can't do it.
Uh, when I was in internship, when - uh, there are some things called kids activity, uh, I - I had to take care of kids, three kids actually, uh, playing sand near the beach, but one of them just ran off to the beach and get into water.  Uh, I don't know what to do.  I can't swim, so I just rushed over to - to - to the kid that time--- 
Yes, to get him but - but he - he - he - he can swim that's what XXX  , uh, the wave and the tide is not suitable for the kid - kids health.
The wave is a bit higher than the kid.
So, yeah.
Yes, I have.
Uh, the OS?
Window  , Window  .
Because, uh, that's all I needed.  For Mac - Macintosh, like, uh, I know that their - their quality is good, but Macintosh computer is for someone who work in as - artistry like rendering or 3D or something like that but I don't do any of that.  So, I don't use Mac because it's overpriced for me.
Mac, um, I would say Mac is for creating something and the Window   is for general using.
Because that's all I wanted.
I don't see that as a bad trend because smartphone do not - uh, do many thing a little more easier and more connected.  But the computer skill if they like they have to improve anyway.  So, if you are good, so - uh, if you are good with smartphone you will - and but you need to be good at computers too, why don't need good at both.
The teacher's assignments, because otherwise they - they won't go and use the computers.
