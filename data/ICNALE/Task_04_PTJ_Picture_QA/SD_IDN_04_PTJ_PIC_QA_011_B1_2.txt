Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, I like it.
Because it makes me feel free.
And because I love water much.
Yesterday I just swimmed  
In the swimming pool.
No, it's just at the swimming pool.
Hmm.  It's not really swammed   but  
Yeah, play the water.
But I hope to.
Not yet.
Uh, still in the edge.
Yeah.
In the beach?
In the ocean.
Okay.
Okay.
I went to the beach with my family.  It's quite far from here and I went there by car and usually my mom or dad prohibits me to swim on the beach but one day I swam with my cousins and my sister or brother and we went to almost the middle, not on the - in the edge of the beach.  And then because I didn't hear about my parents and then I lost my phone there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
Only Windows.
Because I have no much money.
Yeah, of course.
The OS.  I mean the  
Yeah, operating system.  Everybody says it's different and for those who didn't use to - use the Mac, maybe it's quite difficult to operate it.
Hmm.  Both agree and disagree.
To agree.
Because like what you say it, most of my friends, they cannot, they can't use computer very well.  I mean, just making PowerPoint, they are still confused to make it, but for some people, they still love to learn about computers so it's basically about the person.  We can use it for everybody but then still lot, some more than, I mean like more than half collegers   they can't operate computer very well.
Yeah.
Actually, there are a lot of seminars.  I mean like a discussion about that.
Maybe I can ask my friends to come with me to go to that kind of seminar or something because actually operate computer is not hard at all.  It's so easy.  So, maybe that's one of the solutions.
Yeah training.
Okay, sure.
