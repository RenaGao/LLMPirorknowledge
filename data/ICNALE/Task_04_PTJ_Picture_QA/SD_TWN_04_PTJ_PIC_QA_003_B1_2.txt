Um, you - uh, I used to like to swim.
Now, a bit.
Because there's not many chance for me to go to swim.
Yes.
Because I didn't bring my swimming suit -suit I think.
Because I think swimming is a sport that you won't be very sweating, because it's in the water.
Uh, uh, few years ago, I went to swim in a beach in LA and that time I wear my shoes while I am swimming.  But that is - that shoe is very loose and it's like when I am swimming I lost my shoes in the water.  But when I--- 
No, it's like a shoes that is like a---
No, not for swimming.  Just for when you are playing in the beach and that kind of shoes.   
They're like - they're like - like sandals, but when I am swimming, I lost my shoes, but when I swim back to the sand place, I lost it.  My feet just touched the shoes and I get it back.
Uh, yes.
Macintosh.
Um, because I don't know, actually I don't know how to use Windows.
To use it very well, because I didn't use it before.
Yes.
It's the operative system - system is if - because I think that Macintosh is much stable than Windows.
And also it's more beautiful.
I think it depends on how you - how's your job and how do you want to do it.  If your job is very - if the computer is very necessary to your job, then you should be very good at it, but if it's not, you want - you don't need to be very well at computer skills.
I think so many college students use computer more better is that when - if there are more courses about computer science or some skills that is only for a computer and it becomes more popular in college, then college students will try to learn it.
