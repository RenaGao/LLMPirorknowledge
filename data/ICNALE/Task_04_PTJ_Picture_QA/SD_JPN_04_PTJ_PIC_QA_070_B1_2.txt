 Yeah, uh, I like swimming and because uh I --- I --- I was uh belonged --- well --- belonged in the --- uh --- belonged to swimming club in the high school student.  
 And uh I also go to the swimming club.
 So maybe in --- during the high school, I --- I swim umm four --- four times a week.
 Yeah.
 Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Uh, in this summer vacation, uh, I went to the Awaji Island to swim in the sea --- the swimming beach with my ESS club member  , and I hmm go there by a rental car --- rental car.  
 And uh to go there, there are many people because there are --- this is the summer vacation, August --- hmm --- it is August, so there are many people.
 So maybe uh it's difficult to swim, but uh we can enjoy the beach --- beach activity, like beach volley or some uh watermelon --- watermelon breaking or some kinds of activity I did, yeah.  
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I have.
 A Macintosh machine.
 Yeah.
 Uh, because in Kobe University, uh, there are --- it is pre-installed uh the Macintosh computer and to comp --- to think about the suitability --- suitable, umm, I choose the Macintosh computer.

 And if --- uh --- if --- for example, if I want to use the mail --- mail --- mail app --- application, uh, very --- very faster to --- very fast --- fast --- faster than to choose the icon.
 But uh however, in Windows not --- in uh in Windows, maybe to --- to open the application, maybe there are --- application --- all kinds of uh, uh, application to club, hmm.

 However, in uh personal computer, we need Wi-Fi or some kinds of the connection --- connection status is needed.  
 And personal computer is big --- big one.
 So, uh, maybe from this uh portability, uh, we --- we cannot choose a smart phone, yeah.
