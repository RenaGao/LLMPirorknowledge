I actually don't know how to swim.
I am a bit hydrophobic when it comes to deep waters.
It's only when my sister pushed me to go on a vacation.
Well, it's - she would have expected I almost sank not necessarily during I sank and that's probably why.
Yes, I do PCs stuff.
It's---
They are all Windows.
It's preferably due to the availability and how do I put this, comfortableness when using the OS.
I think the only reasonable difference is probably the number of people using them, and there seems to be a bias between Windows and Mac when it comes to business related aspects.  Most businessmen tend to use Macintosh laptops for I honestly don't know, but they seem to be enjoying it.  Now for Windows, it's more on the general populous; maybe some people in the streets would prefer Windows, those kind of things.
I think it depends on the regulation on how to use it.  Uh, as we can now see, there are lot of people who seems to be addicted to social media but not primarily on the desktops.  It seems to be more prevalent on mobile devices, so as with everything else, we need moderation.
Oh yes.  Sure, implement a rule to limit the usage of the mobile devices and we should probably erect more speech labs that uses computers and other things.
