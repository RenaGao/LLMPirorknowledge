Okay.
I can't swim but I like playing water and I enjoy watersports, even though I cannot swim.
Yes.
One stor - one story of me playing--- 
Swimming - well, it happens over, uh, four or five years ago.  I was in, uh, high school, and that was a time it - it's cold - uh, cold water jumping, it was in winter, and uh, if you were nominated your name, you had to choose between dominating   money for, uh, some charity I cannot remember or you would have to jump into the cold water.
And I got nominated, but I knew that I couldn't swim, so I was afraid at first to jump into the cold river, but, uh, I saw one of my friend.  She is smaller than me and she jumped into the riv - the river, but she did not, uh, sink down.  So, I thought to myself, oh, I could do it too, but, uh, because I was a - I was in track and field and before I start jumping, I set my, uh, position like, uh, running, so I made a long distance before I jump into the river, and when I jumped, I happened to jump into the middle of the river.
Yes, so I almost drowned myself in the river, but luckily, my friend was there.
So, they helped me.
That's why I am still alive.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, I have my laptop.
Window  .
I didn't choose it, uh, my parents bought it for me and I find it very easy to use compared to Macintosh one.
Well, I think the Macintosh is more secure because, uh, the system is hard to hack or pair with other devices, so it's more safe I guess.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I agree some part because, um, when you work in companies or university, it required, uh, computer skills such as Microsoft Adobe because it's, um, I think it's - it's important right now and when you cannot do it, you agree to not hired, but, uh, uh, some of those applications come in smartphone or tablets, so - also able to monitor XXX  
Um, I guess if the teachers assigned the homeworks or assessments that need to use computers, I think it's good.
