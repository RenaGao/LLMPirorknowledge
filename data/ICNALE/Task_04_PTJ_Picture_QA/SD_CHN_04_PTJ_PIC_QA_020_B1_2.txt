It's - it's cool I think.  We often live on the land and are very hardly to touch with the water.  In the water, you can feel very comfortable and also exercise yourself.

Uh, actually, I am really like playing games in the - as I said the system in Mac, that's not fit for all games I will play, and the Windows, it's - it's - it's really good.  I can play all the games in this system.
Yeah, I think people have their own interest.  It's - for me, I don't really like to use the computers in the business or in the class.  Maybe the - the word on the papers, that - that is better.  So, just for people to people, they have different ideas.

Yes.  Uh, that will be useful I think.
