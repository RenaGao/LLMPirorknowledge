Yes.
Um, I like sea, but I don't like swimming.
Because, uh, you - your skin will be - you are going to be - uh, uh, going to be black and I don't like.
More detail?
Or maybe XXX  shock.
I was going to diving, uh, yes, in, uh, Bali - uh, in - in - in Indonesia, yes.  And I - I was - I was being taken to the middle of the sea, and then, uh, we are going to diving, um, a very deep, about 10 meters.
And then, uh, I saw a - a lot of, uh, fishes that, uh, we - we can - we can't see in our - in normal.  And then, uh - and the travel guide have, uh, taken - have taken a video for us, yes.
Yes, that's a good memory.
Yes.
Uh, Mac.
Yes.
Because it's easy for me to use because, uh, when I was use Windows, um, about - if - if decide buy a new computer, and about 2 years ago, and almost can't, uh, move normally.
Yes, but if you buy a Mac, uh, um, for now it's about 3 years, still good for working.
The way of use is different.
Um, uh, like us in Chinese people used to use, uh, Windows, uh, when - when in school because, uh, the school's systems also use, uh, Windows, so we have no choice to, uh, touch about the MacBook or like that.  So, it's need to take times about 2 or 3 days that - uh, to use - to use about, uh, the Mac - the Mac.  But if you can't, uh, pass this stage then you will think, oh, the Mac was so hard for use and you won't - you - you - you won't, uh, like to use it anymore for some people.
In my opinion, I think it's not a bad thing, because, uh, I think our cell phone will be more smarter, smarter. So, we don't have to worry about this but - but maybe we do something professor that's - that's we have to use computer and then we can learn how to use this software or something else.
I think maybe homework is - is useful for - to us.  If - if you want to, uh, making our skills improving, I think maybe homework is the best.
