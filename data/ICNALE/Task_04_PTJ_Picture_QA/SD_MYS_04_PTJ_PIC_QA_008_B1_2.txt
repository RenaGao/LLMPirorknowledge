Okay.
Yes.
No, I don't.
I'm afraid of water.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, okay, why I don't like water because when I'm maybe around 5 years old like that, I went to the beach which is Pulau Langkawi at XXX  .  I don't remember it clearly.  And then I run it deep, deeply, deeply part and then I might drown.
And then my father saw me and then he came to save me and that's why I don't like water.
It was a powerful experience.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Windows machine.
Not Mac because, first of all, about the prize.  Mac is the expensive one.  I can't afford it.
And then I don't - I don't know how to, you know, Windows and Mac have different like Android and iOS.  So, for me Windows is, is easier.
Much easier a lot.  I think a lot easier.
Um, for me, because my laptop is, the size of my laptop is bigger.  And then Macbook for me, I'm not satisfied with the size of the Macbook because it is small.  I love that, like the bigger ones.
So, the size.  I, when I want to buy a lap - to buy a laptop, I - the criteria is the size.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
For my opinion, uh, because I am the one who is often used smartphone because, you know, smartphone is easy to carry along with us, but for industry, I think it is, it is, uh, how can I say?  For industry, I think it is.  Yeah, maybe they, they should use a computer because maybe they want to transfer a document or, you know, like a heavy work to do because in a smartphone, we cannot do, we cannot save the  document or something like that.
You can just have a conversation talking like that.  So using a smartphone is the simplest, is a simple work.  But in industry, we, we have a heavy work, heavy work.  So we need to use, um, another equipment like laptop so that our work can do properly.
How to encourage them.  Maybe the library can make a contest, make a contest like, uh, for a week, the students can't use a smartphone, and then who is successful, they get a reward for it.  So, maybe they can do it or, uh, once for a month, every single month and I think this will improve the students to not use a smartphone anymore.
