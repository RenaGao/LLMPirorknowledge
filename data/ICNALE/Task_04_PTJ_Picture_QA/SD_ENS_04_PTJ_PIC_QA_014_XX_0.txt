Yes. 
Ah, yes I do.
I was in the swimming - the swimming club back in Guam.  So I have been learning how to swim since when he was like 7 or 8 and I just enjoy it and even now I still go swimming when I have the free time.
Yes, I do.
I am currently using a Dell notebook computer.
Yes.
Uhm, oh, first off, it's the one provided from the company.  So I am just adjusting to whatever they had.
Um, they are - they are just the same.  It's just a different operating system, a different OS.  I am currently using a Mac tablet and I use an iPhone, so I have a general idea how the Mac works and there are some good points about the Mac and the good points about Windows but they - what people say the Mac is more secure.  There's not many viruses targeting Mac but there are many viruses targeting Windows.  So if you have a Windows machine you always have to be careful about having your virus protection software always updated.
I don't think it's a really bad trend.  It's just the availability of using computers.  If it's available in schools, they would learn how to use them.  And regardless of what the trend is now, whether it's smartphones or the foldable phones, so I don't think it really makes a big difference.
