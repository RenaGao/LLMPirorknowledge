 Um-hmm.
 Umm, yes.
 Oh, because I learnt uh swimming uh in childhood --- in my childhood.
 And --- and yes, uh and this is my umm actually I cannot umm good --- I --- I am not umm good at sports in general but only --- umm --- but swimming uh I can do somehow.
 Umm, because umm a mother of my father umm lived near the city uh no, near the sea, so when I was a child.
 Umm, during summer vacation.
 I went to her and she umm preferred uh many swimming tools like beach ball or swimming suit I think, wear --- swimming wear for me so yeah, I went to --- I went there to swim.
 Umm, at my house?
 No.
 Yes.  
 Uh-huh, yes, 4 years ago, I --- when I entered to this university, I bought a --- a Macintosh.
 But uh because of yes umm --- because I traveled around the world visit, uh, Macintosh was broken.
 Only --- only yeah 3 years, so next time, I wanted to buy --- uh --- I want to buy Windows --- uh --- no huh Huawei or something next time.  
 Um-hmm umm  .
 For example, umm, umm, maybe Macintosh is uh more like --- more better for artists or some student   who are interested in umm art because --- so display is more beautiful, uh, I feel --- I feel, I don't know uh in actually but more beautiful and many tools are already installed in Macintosh but Windows are more for businessmen or for not students usually --- usual students.
 Um-hmm?
 Um-hmm.
 Umm   I don't think that it's bad things because, you know, buying a computer is umm difficult for some students.
 Who are poor or who don't have uh much money.
 Umm, so like me, so yes and young people can umm learn anything umm so soon.
 So, if only once umm the company uh learns   young people how to use computers and then run it, so it's --- it's not bad --- good.
