Yeah.
Yes.
Because, um, I love water and I like to play with it and, um, dream my childhood.  I have lesson of swimming and play with my friends and hangout.  Yes.
No.
So at first during my, um, lesson - my first lesson, I can't - my feet cannot touch the ground so I have to hold something to, um, in order for me to balance in water.  So, the teacher, um, asked me to XXX   like put your hands down into water and breathe something like that.  And after that it goes for one day.  And for the next lesson, she teach me how to swim bet - how to swim better like how to kick, how to use your hand in a proper way and she used some tools that help me to balance since I can't touch the ground and then most scariest part is we have to jump into the water at almost one feet - one feet and we need to have - we have a race who is the faster one to reach the point.  So um, it was exciting and really fun having with some friends, new friends and XXX  .
Yes.
Windows.
Um, I don't know - I don't know.  I just - my mom just give computer to me.
No, I didn't know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think, um, smartphone that we can carry everywhere so while the computer is very heavy, I mean, it's bag to carry it and sometimes it's really - really, really dangerous since there is lot of cases, thief and something like that.  And, um, sometimes they - they know how to type faster in a phone but they don't know how to type on the computer very fast and they use - it's like a routine that testing each other with phones and sometimes they confuse about using phone.  They're like 24/7 XXX  .
I guess -
Yeah.  When you like have a lesson, computer lesson, so they know how to - there is key or like a shortcut key.  So maybe their work can be more faster than type on the phone.  So I think classes - maybe they will - can enhance people or make people interested and use computer more than phone.
