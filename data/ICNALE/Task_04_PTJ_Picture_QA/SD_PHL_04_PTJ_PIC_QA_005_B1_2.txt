How to swim.

Because it is easier for me to work with.
I think it would be the interface.
It - the Windows interface has lesser animations than the Mac interface.  The Mac interface however offers a more descriptive and user friendly interface.  But at the bottom frame of this comparison about Windows and Mac, the Windows have more features to offer than Mac.
I think yeah, it is kind of bad trend because smartphones are really portable, but they offer half the functionalities of a computer.
Yes, if they are offered with charging stations at their facility or the school, and if they are really given the chance to use their laptops during their class while in class, I think that should be it because the phones usually are that quite about small and yes.
