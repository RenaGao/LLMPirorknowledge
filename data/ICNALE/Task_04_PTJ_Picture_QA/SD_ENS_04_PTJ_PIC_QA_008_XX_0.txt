Oh yes.
No, I can't swim.  I sink like a stone.
I enjoy wading.  I enjoy  
Uh, yeah I enjoy the beach.
Uhm, I like getting away from the city and seeing - seeing a natural type of scene and yeah, especially the - the summer season when everyone is relaxing and is having a good time.
Yeah.
Yes I do.  I bought one yesterday in fact.
I bought a, let me see, an Acer, yeah.
Yes, a Windows machine, Windows 10.
Uh, it was a nice upgrade, the hard drive was 150 gigabytes, there was nice improvements, 8 gigabytes of memory, that's double on my old machine and the graphic processor was an important point.  Yeah, so it's kind of hard comparing the Intel numbering series because 4000 is better than - than - it's about the same as 500, so it's kind of confusing when buying a laptop.
Windows machines are more popular.  Macintosh is designed to be more simple.  Macintosh focuses a lot of on creative type things, such as a music composition and graphics and it seems Windows has much, much more software that's available and open source and yeah there's lot more that you can customize with a Windows machine.
Oh yes.
Ah - right.
Hmm, I think that there's lot that you can do with phones now and there is a lot that people are overlooking with the capabilities of phones.  For example, uh, the cloud storage and collaborative apps that you can use for like office software and creative compositions.  So I think a lot of people are missing out on that.  You can still take advantage of that with PCs but a lot of people are on the go and something more simple to do a routine task.
Oh, for using computers more often, I would say, uh, let me see, for creative spaces, hard to find spaces in schools and lots of school still have computer labs.  Universities specially have - have spaces where people are free to schedule their own times in.  But high schools are much more rigid in having - having a room that goes unused a lot of the time.
