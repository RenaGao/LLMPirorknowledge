Yes.
Yes.
Yeah I do like to swim.
Hmm, because, uh, for me when we are swimming, uh, I find a comfort zone for me because you can clear your mind, you can clear your stress.  And for me I do take a few swimming classes, so for me is become a leisure, a hobby for me to swim, yes.
Uh, yeah I have a story when I was a child, uh, I was -- I was going on a vacation with my grandparents at a nearby beach near my hometown.  As me and my brother are swimming and then my brother like he don't want to go in to the deep water because by that time he was afraid of water and he do not know how to swim, so for me as a bigger brother, I moved my XXX   and then I challenged him to go to the deep water and then I end up going to the deep water and I accidentally stepped on a very very hard rock and I just crashed my bottom of my leg.  So it end up bleeding and I ended up crying.
So I -- I just go to the surface as fast as I can.
Yes very.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes sure, I have.
Uh, I have Windows one.
Uh, because when I was a child I really are in to computer stuff.  So I started them and learn and I do some research about and since I was in standard three, I guess, I already can say master Windows by that time at early age.  So when I use Windows it's much more comfortable with me and I don't like to mess things up.  So for me is safer to go with the things that I usually use, yes.
Yeah.
Yes smart phones.
Yes.
Yeah.
Uh, for me I agree with those business people because usually when you are attending work after university most of like office work requires you to use, uh, computer and so is a very very important thing to know how to use a computer as best as you can from an early age.  So you -- when you are -- you attend your job then requires you to have the computer skills, you not to be caused a shock.  So for me because I have -- I also have a friend that not good in computers.  So when he asked me to do the stuff, I much more refer to teach them instead of me doing for them.  So for me it's quite important to have computer skills.
How to use computer?
Hmm, for me I'd like to suggest that lecturers take the students to computer lab so they can practice -- practice it so because many lecturers like to use slides, uh, as a presentation to teach a student.  For me personally I -- I quite dislike that method because sometime it can make you feel sleepy and make you cannot focus because sometimes they're sitting can be bad and much a problem, so for me I would like to do like class in a lab or computer lab, so everyone can interact with the computer instead of so is like a one-to-one teaching lesson, by you teach yourself how to use a computer and you also use teaching yourself how to manage a computer.
Yes.
