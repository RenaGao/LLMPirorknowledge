Yeah.
I like - I like swimming, but like play in the water.
I just like water.
And I like XXX .
Yeah.
Yeah.
Swimming in the ocean.
Uh, yeah.  A few weeks ago like him, uh, I went to beach for swimming---
---uh, with my friend.
But before - before my friend I always needed a tube.
Yeah, because I can't swim. 
But - but she taught me how to like play in the ocean. 
So, I - I didn't have any tube thing or I really enjoyed because like just walking in the water or jumping in the water. 
Yeah, I have one.
Uh, Mac.
You mean like laptop thing.
Window.
Because Window is easy to use.
Uh, the biggest.
Difference is I think it's like the display thing.
Using the tools like - like software thing like I don't really know about the Mac, so. 
So, students don't use computers really, but what - actually, I don't really like to think that's a bad trend because if the students can like access to the information, uh, easily - easier than like computer the smartphone is really easy to use, right.  So, if they can like do some study thing or academic thing with their smartphone, I - I think it's good.  But still I think they still need computer for like doing their assignment or something.  I don't think it's like bad thing.
Assignment thing because there are lots of things they can't do with their - only their smartphones, so---
