Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Not really.
Because I don't really like it and I think that when I swim in a - in water I feel like I drown and I can feel the ground on my feet.
Yeah, I have.
Ah I - I like ocean, I like beach, and I feel like something - something like...
Just but not in the.
Yeah.
Yeah something like that.
Ah I have experience going to the beach with my family and then it's when I around 7 or 8 years old.
And then I really like go to the beach, I feel like water in my feet and it's so cool.
Yeah.  Not swimming because - I try to swim.
But when I go to the water there is something like, you know, the water sound.
Uh, the water feel like going to my mouth.
And then I feel like oh, I cannot do this anymore so I don't want to go to the beach and swim around anymore.
Hmm, a small one I think.
Four.  Uh-huh.
Yeah I have one.
A Windows one.
Because I think I can use it easily - easier more than Mac.  I tried to use Mac but I cannot use it.  I think like user interface is not for - is not suitable for me.
Yeah.
I think it's in the hardware there is no problem but in the software in the program there are more easier to Windows than to use Mac and then in Windows there we can use it in anywhere.  But in Mac we cannot do it.  I think like Mac is has higher class than Windows.
Yeah.
Uh-huh
Why?
Hmm I think I don't agree with that.
Because basically smartphone and laptop is like the same but they are the different device but they have a same program, they have same uh manual use.  I think like when people say when we use smartphone more often than laptop, it's not related.  I think that people who use smartphone also use - also can use laptop.
I think with - the lecturer can give the task to search the XXX   because I think when we search it in the smartphone, it's not - I don't feel so.
Yeah.  I feel more comfortable with using computer to search that.
