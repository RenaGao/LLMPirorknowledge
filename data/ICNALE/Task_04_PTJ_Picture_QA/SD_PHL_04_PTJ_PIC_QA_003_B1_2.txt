Uh yes.
I just want the water.
Uh, my first experience at the beach was at Batangus, I am sorry, there and then I - I enjoyed the company of my family and - and our friend's family and at first, I was really afraid because I really - I - I always imagined that there are sharks and other species living in the water.  But then I conquered it and I have learned how to swim.
Yes, I have.   
It is a Windows machine.
Actually, it is my family who choose it.  And it's much cheaper than the Macintosh.
I think the big difference between Mac and Windows is that uh, Windows is much more open to the - to other third-party sources rather than the Mac.
Well, I believe that uh, the use of computers must - must still be like nowadays because especially for me, I am an IT student.  Having a smartphone is not that reliable most of the times, most especially if we have a programming subjects, if we have some presentations to make, right, and if you are on that line being an - being an IT student, it is really important for you to have the computer instead of the smartphones.
I think that in the - in the classes, I think that the - the phones should be kept away and the - the professor should encourage the students to - uhm, the professor should give more activities that requires the usage of laptops like the programming, creating of presentations and others that are cannot be done on smartphones.
