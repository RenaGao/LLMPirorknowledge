Um-hmm
Yes, I do.
Sorry?
Yes.
Well, during my university days, I used to go surfing every weekend, and it's like a really fun memory that I have.
So, every Saturday morning, I go on a road trip with my friends, and it's like a three-hour drive from my city.
So, we get there - we travel around 4 a.m., and we get there around 7.  So, in the morning, the waves are big and the sea is calm, so I could get to surf.
Um-hmm.
Yes.
I have a Sony Vaio.
Sorry?
Yeah.
Because I am more comfortable, like, using Microsoft computers than like Mac.
I am used to it.  Like, I grew up using, like, Microsoft, so.
Well, their, like, operating system is different.
And their programs quite different.
Um-hmm.
Um-hmm.
Well, I - I agree it's not that good because it's a lot better to use the PC because it has, like, bigger screen and it gives, like, clear, like, words, sometimes if it's too small, then you get to make some mistakes, but you can't, like, really notice.
Hmm.  Like, have, like their own PC at school.
