Yeah, it was quite enjoyable.
Yes, I did.

Umm, just relax and know that the person that you are speaking to is not actually putting any pressure on you.  Usually, the pressure is coming from yourself.  And if you can relieve yourself of that pressure, then no problem.  Just relax.

Hmm, because I have a strong opinion on smoking and some of the - the topics you have brought up, I have seen them happen in - in my country, and I also see the - the other side of it in Japan.
