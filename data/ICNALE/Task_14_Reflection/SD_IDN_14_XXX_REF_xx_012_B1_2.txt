Yeah, it's really interesting I think.  So, we spoke about four different things which is very, very interesting, and also really, really nice I think.
Hmm, not really.  I would say 7 out of 10.
Yeah, because, you know, it's never - it's never really happening to make a good result if you don't prepare a lot.  So, actually I haven't speak   English for last 2 months while I have community service agenda.
So that's really, yeah it's a long - it's been long time since last time I spoke English.
Hmm, yeah sometimes when I lost my vocabulary, I think I felt nervous.
Yeah I think we need to listen more to the English, we need to write more English, we need to speak more English.  It will be a really, really natural to speak or listen to the English.
I think part-time job.
Yeah.  Because the reason for still taking the part-time job is easier to find rather than why we have to complain to the restaurant that have their own rule.  We are only a customer.
I would say it's more preferable the role play.
Because it's very - not it's very - it's more imaginative than the picture one.  The picture we only describe the picture but in the role playing section we have to read the situation and then we think about the imagination of - of the situation in the real life, yeah.
You are welcome sir.
