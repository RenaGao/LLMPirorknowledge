Um, when I first come, I feel a little bit nervous but with you, I tried to make myself comfortable and right now, I'm very comfortable with my interview.

Ah, yes.
Yes.
Yeah, not really.
Yeah.
Uh, I try to make myself comfortable with the environment because I will try to speak to you or something like that.
Uh, maybe before they went for interview or speak, at, at least, they need to practice at home, maybe read something so that can gain their confidence.
Smoking.
Um, maybe smoking.
Because everybody don't like smoking person.
Yes.
Yes.
