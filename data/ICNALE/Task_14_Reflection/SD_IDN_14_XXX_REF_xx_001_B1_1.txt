Afraid, yeah, because, you know, I already - already told you that my conversation is quite a bit not that really good.
Yeah, just worry.
No, no, no, no, no.
My performance, yeah, my performance.

In my case I have to, you know, practice a lot more and maybe, maybe, maybe not a long time I will took   some courses for the English, so yeah.
Easier is the part-time job.
Yeah, the - the - the situation is quite a bit difficult for me.  I am never doing this customer like that.

So whenever I am - you know, I am lost with my words, so maybe, the partner can uh, start in the conversation and make me to make another word.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.  So sorry with my conversation things.
Okay.
