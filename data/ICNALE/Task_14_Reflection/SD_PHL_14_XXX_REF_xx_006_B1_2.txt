Uh---  
I think I did a pretty decent and good job because I was able to answer uh, clearly and I was able to express in this the pictures.
Uh, not at all.
An advice I will give my friend who is nervous speaking in English is to uh, still sit up straight and to use body language to express what you are saying, so it will be easier.  Also keep your head up and don't - or don't look down.
I think uh, the non-smoking is way easier for me because I have never experienced a part-time job before, and I've already experienced entering a restaurant where there are a lot of smokers and it isn't - there is no smoking policy.
I prefer the picture description---  
Way better because I am way better with visuals, uh, I like seeing objects and pictures first so I can first think in my head before describing.
Alright.
