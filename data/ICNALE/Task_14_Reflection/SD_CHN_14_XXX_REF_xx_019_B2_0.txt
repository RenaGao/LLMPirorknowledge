I also speaking Japanese, uh, these years, uh, sorry but really, uh, it is making my English skills go down.

Um.
I think the only way is to speak more, yeah.  And you, uh, as - as I said before, I watched a lot of drama every day, but even though I feel nervous to speak English.

You - you have - um, you can - you, hmm.
