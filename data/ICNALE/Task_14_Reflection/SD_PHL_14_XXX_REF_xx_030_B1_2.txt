Umm, at some I really think I did a good job but at some parts I really think I did an okay job.
Umm, a little bit because I'm sometimes I may not that good when talk in English and - in a full-well conversation.  Sometimes I really - there will be XXX  .
I guess, really practice and be confident when you - umm, speak in English because what's the use of learning the lf if you really don't use it?
I guess the smoking or one with the pictures it really - I can really express my - use my use of English language when it comes to telling a story about - umm, well, with the use of pictures.
The one with the pictures because - umm, it already gives me an idea of how the story will go and how will I - what types of conversations I will use.
Thank you.
