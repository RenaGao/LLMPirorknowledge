I think I do barely passing - barely passable - barely passable interview.  
I don't feel nervous because I - the last time I speak English, this - this long time this - this---
No, no, but I speak English maybe only for 2 or 3 minutes when at - for - for one moment I would speak English like 2 to 5 minutes when I explain we do reach place to some tourists.  But for interview like this, I never had any before.
It should be practice to - practice. 
To practice on - practice on.
 I like best the part time job or because I have many ideas to speak, but I cannot speak it.  And for the non-smoking job I have limited ideas.  This, I have a few - fewer ideas to speak. 
I like the role - role play better because it is not - it is not ordering you to - to describe any moment and it does not require you to do a few - a - a few grammatical tense like past tense.
