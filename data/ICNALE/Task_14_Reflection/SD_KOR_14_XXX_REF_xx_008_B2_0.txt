Mm-hmm.
Interview is quite fun to do.
Oh, I have - I have more to say at the role play.
But actually, yes, I'm satisfied.
I was little nervous at first time.
Oh, I think trying to say English at first is not that important.
I think they have to find a topic that they can be really into and they just start listening and make a friend and they should learn English in a way that they feel enjoyable.
Yes.
Oh, part-time job.
Because smoking here in a restaurant is not a common situation in Korea, but part-time job is very related to our everyday life.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, I preferred role play.
Because I can understand a lot other people think, uh, while we are talking about.
Thank you.
