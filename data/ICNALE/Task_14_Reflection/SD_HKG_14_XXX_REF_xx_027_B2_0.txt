Uh, I think it's quite okay.
Because, um, I could talk a bit - I don't know.  Because I - I was speaking quite fluently I guess, so maybe the - and I - I - I gave like quite a lot of responses and so I - I thought it - it was okay.
Um, not very much because maybe I am studying English, that's why I don't have that nerves  .  And because sometimes I would speak with my friends in English and so maybe I have - I am like accustomed to this.
Um, I think that they - they can try, um, watching more like TV series that are in English and they can actually learn more words and learn how to pronounce the words correctly if they - they watch more of these things.  And they should also like use English more and after practicing more they will feel less nervous.  So - and these are some of my suggestions.
Um, I think part-time jobs would be easier for me because I - I am more familiar with this because I - I myself has got a part-time job that's why I - I had more things to share.
Um, the role play because I think that - that it is more flexible that you can, um, like talk about your opinions like in different ways but if you - if you have to follow the pictures then you're actually like restricted, uh, because you have to - to follow the plot, that's why, um, what you say would - would be, um, like under control.
Hmm, thank you.
