Sure.
Oh, it was nice, it was fun.  It was interesting.
In terms of how I scored or---?
Yes, I think I did an okay job.
Okay.
When I am teaching myself I always remind my students that living in Japan I have to attempt to speak Japanese every day and I frequently make mistakes.
And, uh, I - I like to give maybe some examples of that just to put them at ease and to remind them that as I spoke of earlier, making mistakes is part of learning.  It's a necessary part of learning to make a mistake, to be corrected, to learn from the mistake and the correction.
That one for me had a - an easier flow.
The mother and child with the smoker.
Uh-huh.
This one wasn't in any way difficult, the part-time job boy with the holiday.  But I don't know, this one just seemed to come more naturally without having to think, well, okay this window is this, this window is this.
In terms of ease I probably preferred the picture card simply because it's - it's just my - my - my thoughts coming out, you know.  In terms of a challenge or - or having to rise to the occasion I - I preferred the role play because I can't predict what the - the - the - the other person i.e. your good self is - is going to say.
Yeah.
Nothing in particular, no it was all very easygoing, very, very comfortable setting, very easy to do.
Thank you very much for having me.
