Uh I think that's really my first experience and I think like it's I am so nervous.
Yeah.
I think I have a good job but I - if I have some time to prepare - I mean like uh do - do it again, I think I have to make it better.
Uh-huh
I think it' about how we think this interview.  I think if we think it like casual a conversation with friend, we can do it easily and I can think I can do it more comfortable than now.  But I - I - I now I just feel comfortable and just it's me, the one who nervous.
Uh-huh.
I think the nonsmoking one is easier for me.
Because it's really like to me, I - I don't like a smoker and for a part-time job I don't really have much experience in that area.
Uh-huh.
Ah I think I like the picture  .
