Yes, sure.
It was a very nice interview.
Well, it - it was okay.
Because I was a bit nervous.
Okay.  Many students say they feel nervous when speaking in English.  Did you also feel nervous today?
Then, what should we do not feel nervous when speaking in English?
Okay, uh, then what kind of advice do you like to give to a friend of yours saying that they always feel nervous when speaking English?
Okay.  Today, we had two role-play topics, part-time job and non-smoking.  Which topic was easier for you to talk about?
Why do you think so?
Okay.  As you remember, we had two types of speeches today, a picture description and a role play.  Which did you prefer?
Why?
Okay, okay.  Okay that's all.  Uh, you really did a good job.  Thank you very much again for attending this interview.  Thank you.
