Uh, I will say I - I have a big, uh, area for improvement in the English speaking still but I really enjoyed, uh, in this conversations and I look forward if I have more chance to talk with people in English, yeah.
Thank you.
Uh, I will say I am not feeling nervous or stressted  , uh, because I really enjoy to present - I really enjoying on presenting my own opinion.  Uh, yeah, so I am really happy on it and - but I will be, uh, streful   after the test because I may feel not because of the, uh, interview, because of I am lacking of vocabulary, yeah, still the area of improvement.  Yeah.
Uh, I will say practice make perfect.  They will - they feel nervous because - not because of the English, it's because of their mind.  They don't have, uh, a lot of experience on speaking English, so they may feel people are, uh, teasing them while no one is teasing them.  So, they just need, uh, more chance to speak out loud and just trust themselves, yeah.
Yeah.
I will say part-time job is much more easier because I have experience on it.  Uh, while, like smoking, uh, I will say I have talk about smoking topics in Cantonese a lot but not in English.  Uh, as I said before, uh, part-time job for any business, uh, environment I have engage a lot in my, uh, academic time like in the lecture time but the non-smoking topic or issue that I have seldly   touch it, so it will be much more difficult for me to spid   in that topic.
Uh, I prefer role play, uh, because the role play, uh, is a, uh, two-way communication instead of just describing one thing, it's just ideal for my works while it is not that interesting and role play you - you need to have instant response based on what respond - another responder talk about, then it will be much more interesting and much more realistic, yeah - realistic, yeah.
Okay.  Thank you so much.
