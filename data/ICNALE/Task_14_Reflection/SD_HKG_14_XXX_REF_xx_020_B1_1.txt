I think I am not XXX   I am not having a good job in today's interview.
Because, um, I think I have many grammar mistake.  And, also the - some types of question are not familiar, um.
Um, some of them - I feel a bit nervous.
And because, uh, I am not always speaking English except, uh, during the class, um, I - when I talk to friends or people so I almost use Cantonese so I am not familiar - quite familiar with English.
Um, I think maybe we should talk more to different people, uh, using English and that will increase your confidence when you talking English.
Um, maybe part-time job.
Because, um, I have experience in part-time job but and non-speaking - the topic of non-speak - non-speaking - non-smoking is, uh, like a - like a   new thing so that we talk about, uh, and therefore part-time job maybe easier a bit than the non-smoking topics.
I prefer role play.
Because, uh, some of the pictures, uh - some of the picture are not - I am not really know some of the pictures, uh, the meaning of that pictures.
Perhaps the role play comment, uh, have some words and that's easier to understand.
You're welcome.
