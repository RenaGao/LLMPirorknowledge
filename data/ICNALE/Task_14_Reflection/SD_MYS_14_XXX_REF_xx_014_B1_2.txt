Yes.
Yes, the interview very good.  Yes.
Aha, maybe yes, I think.  Yeah.
Because, um, to me, uh, I have not  spe  spoken English like this for very long time.  So, it was very exciting for me, uh, to be able to talk English back.
Yes.
Yes.  A little bit yes, because, um, as I say, you know, I haven't spoken English like this for a very long time.
So, um - but it's normal for speakers to  fil  their words, you know.
We should just, uh - if you are a new talker, you should just, uh, literally stick your mind.  Yeah.  At least, try - at least - if you grammar mistakes, it's - it's okay, but at least trying to speak your mind, trying to convey your message to the interviewer or so.  But, at least, uh, -- uh, the interviewer will understand you better.  Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
I think my close experience was the, uh, cig, uh, smoking.
Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.
Because---
Because, uh, my dad is a smoker, you know.  So, we always debate in English, you know, trying to persuade him not to who smoke anymore.  Yes.  Huh.
The role play.
Uh.  I prefer the---
Yes, the picture.
The picture.
Because it's easier for me to see the situation, uh, and to express my opinion, of them, uh, based on the picture.  Uh, for the role play, uh, we have to have quite good  emigia  imagination for you to express your opinion on the topic.  Yeah.  So, I prefer the, um, pictures.
Yes.
Thank you for  being each other  for interview.
