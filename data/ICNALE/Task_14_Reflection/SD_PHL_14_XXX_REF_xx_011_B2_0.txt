I think the, the interview is great.
I think, even though I stuttered, I think I did a pretty good.
Ah, I was able to come up with answers and not, and not stop for a long time and not stop for a long time ah, frequent, more frequently than last, than the last interviews I did.
I don't, I don't think that I feel nervous.  But ah, the only thing, the only problem I have is like thinking of the words that, the words that I should use.
My only advice is when speaking in English don't think of it as a very foreign language, think of it as your own language that you own that language.  And I think what will help you the most is that treating it the same way of your own native language.
I think it is easier for me to answer the part-time jobs, because it is more, somewhat more relatable as a college student that the thought of having a part-time job once.
I think I prefer the role-play.  Even though the picture one is easier, the role-play makes me kind of feel, try to feel more comfortable in, in trying to, trying to get into the action or the scene of the role-play.  And I think that will improve, make me improve much.
