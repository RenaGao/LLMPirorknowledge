Uh, first of all, in the start it was a little bit confusing but, uh, with the passage of time, I interested and I like it.

Yeah.
Uh, obviously when we do the thing, uh, sometimes or not in our daily life routine, we have a nervousness.  For example, if we didn't present the things daily like a teacher, he present daily a - his or her lecture, so he didn't, uh, have any nervousness.  So, with the passage of time when we talk to English with everyone, so we didn't, uh, have any issue.  Like we use Urdu in our daily life, so we can't have any confusion or etcetera.
I advice that first of all, uh, I agree to this, uh, statement that we have nervousness.  But, uh, we, uh, have to talk in English with each other.
There are many mistakes we have to correct them with - uh, tell us that there is a grammar mistake or this word is not, uh, pronounced like this, uh, the word is not this, it is actually this, uh, it maybe, uh, control the confusion or nervousnessness.
Uh, smoking, restaurant WALA .
Because it's an issue and, uh, on this issue when we talk we make we have an interest.
