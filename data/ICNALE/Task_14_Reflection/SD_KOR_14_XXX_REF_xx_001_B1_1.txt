Oh, thank you.
A little bit.
I am feel happy.
Yes, it's okay.
I am also nervous.
Yeah.
If you help - help us some word to me, I can feel less nervous.
Yes.  When I have to speak English, I usually can't find the correct word.
So.
Mm-hmm.
Two is also hard to me.  At that time, I have to persuade to some more - persuade is hard to me.
The topic also not familiar to me.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
I didn't complain like the situation.
I just leave.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Picture description.
Because it - it can by myself.  But roleplaying I have to commute - com - commute  - I have to talking with you.
So, it's still hard to me.
Yeah, thank you.
