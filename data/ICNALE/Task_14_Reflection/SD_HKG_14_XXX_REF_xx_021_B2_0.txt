Um, I think I did fairly because, um, maybe there are some time that I didn't, um, speak as well, I have to think about it and it's time consuming and then, um, my grammar may not good and my sentence structure also may not good so I will say, um, I did fairly.
Um, not at all.
Um, they feel nervous because they seldom speak in English and because most of the time they speak their mother tongue like Cantonese in Hong Kong.  And they - may they claim that they don't have any chance to speak English but, um, like I know some of my friends claim - uh, they say that, um, they don't want to speak in English because they don't have any competent.  And then they afraid of mistake - making mistake so they don't want to speak English at all.  For me, I think, um, they should be brave, um.  I know, um, English is not our mother tongue.  Cantonese is our mother tongue.  Um, I think the foreigner would understand us because our mother tongue is different from them, and then if you want to - if you willing to speak and they will - they will teach you from right from wrong so, um, you can know and polish yourself.  So, first of all, I think you have to, uh, you be brave and willing to speak.
Maybe, um, I would say part-time because, um, I do a part-time as well.  For smoking, I think it's okay for me, but, uh, not familiar because my parents, my, um, other family members are non-smoker, and I seldom or I don't have a friend who smoke.  So, it's quite hard for me to speaking about, uh, smoking or non-smoke.
I prefer   uh, the one with the pictures plus it's - you have time to, um, organize your answer and then it's easier for me to follow the structure.  And then, for the role play, I think it's quite challenging because you don't know how, um - how the other response to your answer and then you have to think the answer immediately.  So, it's hard for me to organize a perfect answer in a - within a short time period.
Thank you.
