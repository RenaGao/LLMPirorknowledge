Uh, it was interesting.
Because  .
Because like, I was asked on so many methods, so it makes me think on my opinion and so the methods which I don't get asked to every day.
I think I did well.
Uh, actually, I don't feel nervous because, I think about it as something not that serious, not that intense, so with that, so I don't XXX   not feeling so nervous  .
I think, just to be confident when you speak because sometimes, like, even the native speaker they make mistake when we speak, but if you have that confidence your mistakes are somehow covered - somewhat covered up.  So, whenever you feel like you need to speak English then do it with confidence, so that, people don't see your fear.  If they see your fear then you would - your mistakes and your - your grammar even though they are wrong but, as long as you get your - as long as what do want to express people can understand that very well then there will be like there would be enough.
I think the smoking topic.  The restaurant and the man-smoking topic.
Because this is a topic that is common, any, and it has been talked about many times recently and there is a lot of take that, I see these topics online, people been talking about it frequently and agreeing and disagreeing about it, so, to talk about this topic I have more inputs than I do on the part-time job.
I prefer the picture description.
Because it is very subjective.
Because I can - I just need to express what I see and what I think about the picture, yes.
