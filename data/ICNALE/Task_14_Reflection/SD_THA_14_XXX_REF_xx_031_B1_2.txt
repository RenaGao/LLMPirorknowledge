Uh, today interview is fun, and I mean they give me the opportunity to think, to criticize the situation, making the - uh, role play, yes.
No.
Uh, maybe because my speaking - speaking skill maybe some - some part I cannot - I cannot describe or explain clearly.
Yes, I did when I - when I first walked to - into this.
Uh, I - I have no idea.  I think it's - it depends on interviewer.
For me, it depends on who I am talking with, the atmosphere around like talking to the interviewer, because you are very smiling and, uh, listen - listening to me.
So, that's why I feel relaxed.  Yeah.
The part-time job.
Because - because I have - I mean, I have exp - experience by myself.  Not - not because I have worked as a part-time job but because I have a friend who worked as a - work part-time job.
So, I can talk about that more than smoking.
I prefer picture description.
Uh, because it's involved with your imagination and because there's a picture that you can see and you just make up a story about what you see and your - uh, no, your imagination, but about the role play, you have to work to - to coordinate with other - with other people.
Yeah.  So, it's kind of - I don't know, that one - that other people - what - what the other people is going to say.  So, it's kind of hard for me to do the role play.
Thank you.
