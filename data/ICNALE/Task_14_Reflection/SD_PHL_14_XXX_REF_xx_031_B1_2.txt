Ah on some parts I was quite very I was doing really stutter stuttering words.  I tend I was very I was nervous a bit but.  I think I get I did a okay job.
Hmm.
No, because this was really intuitive.  I was spontaneously called upon called here for an interview.  So, I was not really nervous.  But if the time pa as time passes by, I tend to build up that nervousness inside me.  So I'd rather do it right now.
There is my only advice is to anal-analyze your tone of speech.  You have to assert dominance in speaking.  You have to show them that you have the high grounds in terms of when in speaking English.  So you don you don't have to be nerv so you won't be nervous about speaking English.  You just have to raise your chin up, sp-speak right up there and just say whatever you are thinking, say whatever your need to be whatever words that are need to be spoken.  And perhaps never think about judgments when of people on you because people don't really care that much about what's what do you like or something like that.  Yeah.  Just analyze your tone of speech and people will listen to you.
It was I I found the smoking part very easier to understand and because well smoking is really a bad habit and that particular situation is quite understandable that the mother got angry because her child was coughing from the smoke.  Just.
Hmm.
I prefer the role play because I can say what I think and I am not locked in a situation.  Umm it's not situational.  Ah I am not locked in this.  Unlike the picture, the photography example, I I am not within that specific topic.  I can say whatever I want within specific field be-because when-whenever I role play, I tend to do ad lib and I really like speaking what I think.
Okay.
