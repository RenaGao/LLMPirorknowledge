Uh, it was really - I was really nervous and I am not that confident enough with my answers.
Maybe yes, maybe no.  Uh, there are some - some of the tasks are quite I think hard for me.  I - really I am not uh, used to describing things like when I see an image, I am not used to describing things.
Yes.
Well, for me, I think I should really practice myself speaking in front of other people using the English language because most of the time I really speak in our mother tongue.
I think the - uh, the topic about smoking because only myself I really stand before other people who are uh, annoyed when it comes to the public smokers, I myself do not want as that kind of scenario that there are people who are in public spaces which smokes.
I think the role-play because I was able to say whatever I wanted to.  It's as if I was just speaking to another person and that's what I said earlier, I am really not that great when it comes to describing images.
Thank you so much.
