Okay.
Um, I think it went well, even though I am not well prepared I would say.
Oh, you might say so.
Um, I think I did a great job because I just tell the truth or what I think.
Not.
I often say to my - for example, my close friend, she is majoring in English also but she - when it comes to speaking English, she seems like - she - she has lost her mind.  Uh, so, I encourage or I tell her just speak up, do not think too much or do not worry about what other people might say about your accent or I think it's not our mother tongue so you can - we can make mistakes, so just speak up.
Definitely, part-time jobs.
Because it, uh, related to my daily life and I have like - um, various, uh, vocabularies more than smoking.
Which I - do I prefer, oh - um, I prefer role play.
Uh, um, I think it's more easier for people when - when you imagine if something happens to you what will you do.  Yeah.
Uh, thank you so much.
