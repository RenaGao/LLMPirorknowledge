Um, I think my performance not very good.
Because - because most like I think the main reason is I have to like do some translation in my brain before I tell you like while - while I answering the question, if they are quite difficult then I have to first think in Cantonese and then after that trans - translating it into English and sometimes I may because nervous and I not think of those vocabulary - vocabularies that I can - could use to express my ideas also.
Yeah.
I think first is to improve my own English level, but if I have a good foundation of English then I - my - in my with - it can reduce my nervous while I am speaking of it, yeah.
Um, I think part-time job might be much more easier because current - currently I have my own part-time job also and I could directly use my own experience to just to tell you and - and to elaborate it also, yeah.
Hmm, I think I prefer a role play because it will much more easier for myself to just like base on the information of the role play and I could create a story of it, but for picture one I had to under the picture guidelines and think of those lines which is suits for that picture, yeah.  So, I prefer role play.
Thank you.
