Well, not a very good one.
Sometimes I still like mur - murmured, yes, so I don't really satisfy but I think that I did - I did participate and I did engaged in it and I do think that you feel satisfied with my performance, yes.
A little bit because--- 
---this is an academic research.  I think I just doing other thing so I have a little bit nervoused answering all the questions.
Uh, so practice more is the only way.  If you don't have the chance to practice or try to speak out loud, you can never succeed or you can never make it fluent or make it at least communicatable.
Part-time job I would say.
Well, at first, I have a part-time job and for years I would say and also smoking is like, um, really don't have much to discuss on, I would say, smoking is actually something that should really ban once and for all for good for real good.  And how people can get relaxed through smoking I really don't have a - have a - have a sense or have a idea on it, and that's why I do think smoking really don't have something to discussable.
The story one.
Yes.
Story actually is a better way for us to express our, um - our, uh, feeling or our mind because role play sometimes I can't put myself into it like, um, the situation.  You actually put some, um - I won't say restriction but you - you did put some condition on the, um, role play and sometimes I really can't put myself into it at once.  So, um - but story I can always create and I can always construct a story, that's why it comes easier.
Thank you.
