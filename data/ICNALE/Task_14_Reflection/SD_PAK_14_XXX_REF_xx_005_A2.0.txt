Because it improves my personal experience and my abilities.  So, it is a very good experience.
Uh, at first, I feel a little bit nervous but then I overcome my nervousness.

They should practice alone, uh, at some time at their home and then they should communicate with other per - person so they can build up their confidence and overcome their nervousness.
I think the non-smoking was one most interesting.
Because I am also a non-smoker and I think I have many solid reasons to be a - avoid of that thing.  So, it is more - most simple and interesting.
Picture description was, uh, easy than role play.

Thank you.
