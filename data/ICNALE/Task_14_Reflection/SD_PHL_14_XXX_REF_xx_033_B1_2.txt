Because I could answer all the questions and I could narrate all the stories and the role play.
Umm a little but not so because I am very familiar with speaking English.
We should tell people that don't talk too fast and clear and have clear thoughts before speaking because people often think that they have to speak fast in English to sound fluent, but they really don't have to.
Umm probably the first one because at the smoking role play, it's the customer that is wrong because at the first place, he knew that the restaurant was not prohibiting smoke but still he still entered it and ate with his friends there.
Umm I prefer role play because it's more realistic in the picture because the picture it doesn't really put you in a real-life scenario where you have to do an argument like that.
