Interesting.
Well, it's not a job but I'll say yes.
Hmm.  You've got to get over the worry fact.  You can't learn otherwise.  Umm, I could give a marketing technique.  Yeah, I've written a book called - I'll probably change the title, but it involves a thing called EFT, Emotional Freedom Techniques, and if you check it out on the internet, you'll find some energy healing, things that help you get over your worries and fears to do with English, and I think that really helps out.  But don't lose sight of the fact that you were studying language because you wanted to communicate with people.  Enjoy the idea of communicating with people, and then if people mistreat you, they are not probably worth friends anyway, and you are - you are going to get better.  It's just a fear basically.  Don't worry about it.
Probably the latter.  That's the smoking one.
Simply because I didn't look at the first one properly in the first place when I saw the guy holding a purple wallet.  I didn't realize it was - had something to do with money.  That's all.
I don't really have a preference, but if I was to be learning a language, I do prefer the make up a story with the pictures situation.
Yeah, I don't know the actual purpose or all the purposes of this particular interview, but something tells me a lot of it is to do with whether the educational system should be changed with the concern to smart devices or computers and what not.  If that is the case, my opinion is to get children back down to the old basics of reading and writing.
Good.  Thank you.  Yeah.
