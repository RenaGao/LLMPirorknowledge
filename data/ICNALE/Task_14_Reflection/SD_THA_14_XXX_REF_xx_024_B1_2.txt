It was pretty long than I thought.
Uh, actually, I - I think I didn't do - uh, as a good - as much as I thought because - uh, lately, I was working with a - you know, with the writings a lot and I stopped talking to myself and practice with speaking.  And it's making me a - uh, not speak - not speak frequently.
Pardon?
Yes, but I guess not as much as before.
It is - this is a hard question, okay - because up to my personal, I - mostly I give advice to myself that when you are talking, then you want to speak English or something like that, you will need to be, you know, trust in yourself.  You have - you will need to have a lot of confidence, have kind of self-esteem or something like that.  If you believe in yourself that you can do it, anything you can do it.
I think it is part-time job.
Because it's something that I kind of relate to because, you know, I - I have a part-time job too, but I never smoke before, that's why it's very hard to talking about that.
Um, uh, I think - I think it's the picture - the picture desc - uh, picture description because the role play, as you can see that, some of the topic is pretty hard to role play because I don't have any experience of calling the owner of restaurant and ask for refund, and it's kind of odd for me, uh, but when you looking in pictures, if you - uh, if you are looking to pictures, you can tell what is happening.  So, you can manage to put some vocabulary and then you can making out the story.
Thank you so much.  Thank you for asking me---
