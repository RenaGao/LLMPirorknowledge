Yes.
Uh, not really because it's not.
Uh, I think maybe smoking.
Because, uh, my - my - my - my father smokes, but he has get rid of smoke, uh, 3 years ago because of surgeries.  So - so I think the smoking thing impress me really good.
Uh, I---
I think maybe the - the - the - the oral talking.
Yes, yes.
Because, uh, hmm, I think the pictures are more, uh, how to say, it's a certain content, uh, so I can't really know what you are thinking about or what's your opinion or what are your focusing on.  But on the role play I can know your pers - uh, personalities, I can know your, uh, your - your - your feelings, uh, while we're talking and - and the role play is also good chance for me to experience your body language, I mean, I think that's the best way for people to communicate.
Especially for foreigners.
