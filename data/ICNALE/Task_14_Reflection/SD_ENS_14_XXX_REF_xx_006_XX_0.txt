Okay.
Uhm, it was fine.
Uhm, I hmm - yes and no, I mean I think I just - I answered it as honestly as I could, so I guess fine, yeah.
Advice, uhm, let's see.  I think what holds back a lot of non-native speakers is like they are - they struggle at least with like not having enough descriptors.
Uhm, so words to describe things because I've met plenty of people that they - maybe they lack vocabulary or the grammar is not as strong but a lot of students can compensate for those sort of gaps if they have good descriptors.  So if you just want to speak freely like I am now, use a lot of descriptions.
Sure.
I - for me personally I would say, the part-time, uhm, as I have little more experience.  Just of course I worked work part-time and particularly when I was a university student as well.  Uhm, with something like smoking, that's kind of just an ongoing debate.  At least may be not so much in the States anymore, but I just feel I had more experience with the part - the first scenario.
Uhm, I kind of preferred the role-play.
It is sort of what I've - I'm used to doing.  As an instructor I often role-play scenarios with or where I'll be this person, A, and then there will be person B and then we switch.  And so this is what I've had - I've had the most experience with - with this role-play.
Uhm, no it was - it was interesting.  Uhm, I'd be interested to know what kind of research is taking place but I guess that's not for me to know, but it was fine.  And it was fun.  This is interesting.
Thank you.
