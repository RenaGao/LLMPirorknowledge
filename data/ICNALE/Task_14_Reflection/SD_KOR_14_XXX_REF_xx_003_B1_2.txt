Oh.
Yeah.
Okay.
Today's interview?
There are many questions---
---that I thought.  However, it was very fun.
Yeah.
Because, um, many questions are interesting and like and the also the role - role play.  It was the role play the situation, mm, it made me to think about smoking inside the restaurant which I have never thought before.
Yeah.
Today, yeah.
Hmm, what do I have to do?
When I get nervous speaking English, hmm, mm, overcoming.
It's just breath deeper and I think even though it's very nervous, at least try to speak in English.
Practice is the best way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Part-time job.
Because, uh, as I mentioned, I never thought about smoking inside the restaurant before.
And I already have one experience to work in part-time job in my college life.
So, it's easy to answer.
Yeah.
The picture one.
Yeah.  Because already there is a situation and the thing that I have to do is just describe it and it's easier. 
Less debate then the role play.
Thank you very much.
