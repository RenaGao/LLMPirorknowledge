Uh, no, I would like to give my - uh, my - this time interview a bad - you know, bad description because I haven't speaking English for a long time, like 2 year or 3 years.  So, I said a lot of, uh - like set of thinking - uh, thinking break, so I am not quite, you know, quite - uh, quite happy or quite approved for my interview.
Thank you.
No.
Uh, you mean speaking Eng - when speaking foreign language, they are--- 
Nervous.
Uh, try - that's basically the - the word I would like to give all of, uh, language, uh, you know, not first English speakers.
Uh, if you want to learn this kind of language, try to speak more people.  I mean those people are not, you know, uh, uh, they have - they - they don't have to be English - English - uh, English don't have to be their mother language.  You can try to find a, you know, co-workers who can help you to improve your language so try to speak more.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, I think part-time job is quite easier for me to speak because, um, it's more, uh, uh, you know, it's - uh, it's actually a topic about life or, uh, it's a topic who are - who relate a lot with my current life.  But for cigarettes, I think maybe because I am a nonsmoker or maybe I am not - mm, notice about this kind of topic, so I think it's quite difficult for me to talk about.
Yeah.
Um, which one do I prefer?  Actually, I don't feel a strongly distinction between those two tasks, but if you have to make me choose that, I prefer to choose, uh, picture description, because for now, I tried a lot for, uh, logic speaking or logic reading.  I prefer to give, you know, the reason one, the second reason, the first reason, this kind of, uh, description, but for, uh, picture description, I - I - I - I just need time - I maybe need more time to look at it.
Thank you very much.
