Uh, yes, decently I would say.
I would say not too bad because like, um, I am able to express myself, uh, flutely   but sometimes there are also parts where I am, em - unable to, um, form ideas and catch up those ideas with, uh, my - with my language.
I didn't really feel nervous, but then the most, uh, I - but then I did feel nervous when I am unable to continue my speech, like, for example when I have an idea or even though when I don't have an idea like I don't know how to deal with those situations because like these are really rare situation and I am not familiar with dealing these situation, so I - it may - may sound awkward and it eventually cause - cause a nervousness at that - at those situations.
Uh, I think the reason that they are nervous because they are not used to speaking English mainly because like they are not - they are not yet to the stage where they are able to use English to express whatever they want because I was once at the stage where, uh, English wasn't really my tool to express myself yet.  But then when I - but then after when I used English a lot more frequently I realized that English can be a tool to express to communicate as long as you know what you are saying and not focused too much on how you should structure it, like, you should - not slowly but then like adapt to the language itself, adapt but not trying to force yourself.
I think the smoking one--- 
Uh, because it's much more relevant or the - or it's easy to respond to questions that are related to smoking as it's really, um, popular topic compared to part-time topic.
Uh, the pictures ones are easier.
Compared to, um, the role play because the role playing requires you to actually think about what you are about to say like prepare for the actual role play, but then for the picture - uh, pictures wise you're - you just simply describing what's happening and trying to structure those descriptions.
