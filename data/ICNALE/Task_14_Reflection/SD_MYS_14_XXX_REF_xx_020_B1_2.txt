I wasn't prepared but I - I think I overall it went pretty well I think.
Maybe because I think because I love English so much that I think I should just be confident even if I didn't do that well.
Yeah.
Obviously.
For me, if we're going to make ourselves more confident, we just have to practice more.  And yeah - just sometimes I think - personally I think that we should just speak ourself even if we are feeling nervous don't show it because when you are nervous people around you will get nervous too.
I think it would be the part-time job.
Because both have connection to me.
But I think part-time job is like more to a student perspective. It is like, um - yeah, it's very close to me because I used to do a part-time job to go nice with my friends.  So yeah.
Um, I think I would say I like the role play.
Because I like to act.
Um, I - I love theater and all, so yeah.
