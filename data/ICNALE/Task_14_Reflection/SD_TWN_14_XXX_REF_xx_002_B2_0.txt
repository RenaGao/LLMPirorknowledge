Uh, so-so.
Um, I think that I haven't practiced my English speaking for a long time.  So uh, it is a little bit difficult to speak at, uh, at once after I read the, um, the text or heard the question.
Hmm, no.
Uh, I think you just try your best and actually no one will laugh at you.
Um, part-time job.
Uh, because it's closer to my life and many friends around me have the part-time job and, um, some of them have faced a situation just like that.
Uh, not teacher, but--- 
Um, maybe, theirself  , they have a dilemma between, uh, their study works or earning money from the part-time job.
Um, role play.
Because, uh, I think in our daily life, we have more chance to have some conversation like this.
And, um, if I can handle it, it's useful for my English speaking.
Thank you.
