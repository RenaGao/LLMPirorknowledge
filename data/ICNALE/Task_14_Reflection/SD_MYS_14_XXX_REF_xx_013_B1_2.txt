Interview, uh---
For XXX  ---
I am feel very nervous.
Uh, because, uh, I don't - I cannot expect what the interviewers will give me for the questions. So, it makes me feel a little nervous, but I still feel, there is confidence inside me to answer the question.  There is still a confidence inside.
Yes.
I think if we keep on talking and we don't care about if someone is judging you, for example, like if your grandma, or your pronunciation is not good, but we just keep on talking again.  It will consistently  bul  up, build up your confidence.  So, when you feel confident enough to talk in English, so it will never be a problem for you to talk anywhere.  So, that's why I think it can boost the confidence.
Smoking.
The part-time job, because I think, uh, I  cann  I can brainstorm a lot of idea compared to the restaurant, because the smoking issue is, um, is a very hard topic for me to elaborate more, so - because the part-time job - even though I don't have any experience in part-time, but I have friends that already been a part-time  workers   So, I actually interact with them, so they can share their experience with me, so I feel more comfortable to - and more easier for me to explain about the part-time job compared to the smoking.
The pictures.
I prefer the picture because, uh, when seeing - when seeing some illustration---
---I can easily  fin  an idea compared to when I am - I am reading, because in reading I need to understand every words that it  writ  there as compared to this illustration graphic.  So, with this graphic, yes, it can help me to develop a lot of ideas.
