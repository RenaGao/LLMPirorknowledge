Mm-hmm
Um, I can't consider in this as like an interview, but more like, you know, experiencing in front of the camera and say something about it.
Not really.  I think I only did like decently---
---not really like good job because I think I can be better in there.
Oh, thank you.
No.  I'm not really nervous.  I just don't know what you're saying.
Hmm, nervous.  Uh, why they are very nervous or how to avoid this nervousness?
How to avoid nervousness?  Uh, of course, what everyone always say practice makes perfect, uh, you don't have to meet a person in order to speak in English---
---you can always speaking by yourself because you have your own freedom here, you have on your own time.  It's just - the only thing is only how you manage the time and how - what do you want to say?  He has to - instead of using the native language, try to think about the English, try to be the native speaker and how to speak a better English.  And you know kid listening to what - a lot of English news, keep listening to English music, English video, perhaps news is very hard ways to learn it.  Watching YouTube is better because YouTube on the, you know, timing is long.
It's a very short video, so it's very easy to us to understand.
Easier.
Uh, I don't know because both of them are actually easy.  It's just like maybe if you ask me like which one do I rather to make a longer topic then smoking is going to be.
Because first of all, I against smoking, so if everyone try to debate with me about smoking then I always be there---
---to debate with him saying that this is bad.  If - no matter how you say, I always think this is bad.
Uh, I - I actually prefer as a role play compared to description because I took drama class when I was in junior - and not junior, a senior high---
---for 3 years, so I prefer doing role play, no, doing some action, doing some different tone, not just like, you know like different tone, same tone.  I like being hiring role like that.
Okay.
