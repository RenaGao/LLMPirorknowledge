 Umm, I think so.  But it's kind of - umm, making me conscious of the words that I'm using and I have to think twice, thrice before I say my answers.
Umm, today, yes, a little bit nervous maybe - umm, more little bit, if there's a word like that and I - I agree to them that - umm, speaking in English is quite - umm, nervous activity or something that will - umm, push them to think twice because a mastery of the language, it requires your knowledge in English before you can speak fluently.
Maybe my advice is you have to - umm, practice more, the way you speak, the way you construct a sentence, the way you understand things, at the same time, listening is important so that it will not be - umm, mislead conversation in-between the people you've talked to at the same time - umm, maybe really have to involve yourself speak in English - umm, as often as you can so that it will be more easy for you to speak in English.
I think the - umm, roleplaying and the - what do you call that - in part-time job.
Because - umm, it is more usual at the same time it happened in my experience before - I experienced that kind of - umm, scenario in my life and I think I can get a lot of doubts   out of that role-play.
Umm, I prefer more on role-playing because in the images that I have seen earlier, it's - it makes my thoughts containable or - umm, limit my thoughts because it is just something that you have to see within the picture.  However, in a role-play it's something that you cannot - umm, limit yourself in saying the words that you like, in adding the things that you want to add and at the same time, it goes well because of - someone that you are conversing with and it's really good for me because I like plays.
You're welcome.
