I think today's interview was relaxed and need to say, uh, good opportunity for the conversation between me and you and we can, uh, express our feelings and points about different issues in, uh, these topics.
Uh, I hopefully not, uh, uh, being nervous when I am speaking English because, uh, even though I am speaking to a foreign, uh, strangers, uh, I am relaxed to express my feelings as I can express it, uh, freely and I can tell what I am going to, uh, talk about.
Absolutely yes.  I think, uh, under globalization I think, uh, all citizens or all, uh, people among world should know how to speak English and should, uh, real - uh, should be relaxed when they're speaking in English to others.  Because, uh, I think speaking English is, uh, really important in our daily lives.  First of all, we need to, uh, uh, speak or, uh, from XXX   professors or the foreigners in different countries or different backgrounds we can, uh, express our feelings and no - and guess what others are going to talk to us.  So, uh, we need not to - uh, to be nervous when we are speaking English.  Uh, because, uh, when we can express ourselves well in English we are relaxed to the time.
I think the topic of part-time job is more easier for me.
I think, uh, because, uh, having experience of being a part-time job worker, it's, uh - can - uh, make myself more familiarize with this topic, so it is more easier for me to think of points - think of the feelings and experiences, uh, in the first few, uh, weeks or first few months.  So I can express them more easily.
Uh, I prefer the role play one because, uh, the role play one can, uh, let us to have more imaginations and have more, uh, more ways to express ourselves.  For example, we have to, uh, uh, seek for conversation or, uh, seek for the, uh, apologize for, uh - from the, uh, restaurant so we can have different intonation usage or different, uh, backgrounds to express our feelings.  So, it is more essential for us to do that.
