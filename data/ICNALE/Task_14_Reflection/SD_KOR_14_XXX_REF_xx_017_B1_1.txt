Thank you.
Mm-hmm
It was very interesting---
---a bit - a bit hard, but yeah, it was good experience to me.
I don't think so.

Yeah and also I'm not good to role play, so yeah.
Oh?
No, if I feel exciting, yeah - yes, I feel exciting, but nervous, I was not, yeah.
Hmm, uh, actually, it's a different experience.  I mean if - if you can - if you can use the English lots of time in your life, you never feel - you don't need to feel the nervous, because we don't - we don't feel nervous if - when we're talking in Korean.  Yeah, I think it's same thing.  So, if - if my friends can make - make lots of chance to use the English, yeah my friend - like my friends never feel the nervous.
Yeah.
Hmm, I think, actually - uh, actually, it was - it was second. 
Yeah, yeah.
