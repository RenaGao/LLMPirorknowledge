Okay.
Sure.
It was fun.
Um, I don't have - you know, I am neutral on that because I don't know what the research questions are.  So---
Oh, um, advice, you mean talking one-on-one in this type of situation or in general.
Um, I mean again I - I pause and think about this because I think it depends on the situation in which they are in.  And so for example if we are talking, doing an interviewer, I mean it's a very - some people hate interviews and so they would have to - role playing for example, role playing the interview and practicing it not - they won't know the tasks but practicing what they think might come - might you know alleviate that anxiety I suppose.  If they are again different situation so if they are talking in group, um, or something and they get - they are nervous with that, I mean that's easier because they are talking in a group so they can, you know, sit back a bit and then take your time and thinking and forming their thoughts.  So again the situation - it depends on situation for the advice.
Um, personally, I don't think they - don't think any of them were easier per se.  I think the - the tasks you gave after were a bit more complicated because of internal beliefs I suppose and then  
Oh, sorry, it was all good.  So then let's go on there.  I don't think any of them were easier than the other ones.  And it depends on what students choose to talk about.
Right.
I preferred - no preference, is that okay?
All right.
Yeah, no preference.
No.
I am sorry.
Yeah.
Thank you.
