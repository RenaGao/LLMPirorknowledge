Uh, I think I can do better because at some task I kind of, uh, couldn't make - couldn't speak too fluently, yeah.
Well, uh, because - maybe because I don't talk so much in English nowadays as I used to do so, uh, I - I got to think before I can talk.
Uh, not exactly nervous, just - it's just that I couldn't come up with the words to say.
Yeah.
Well, I would advise them to, uh - act as still they were foreign, like, uh, native speakers so, uh, just think about how their, uh, favorite Hollywood actor was speaking English and then try to imitate them as they speak, yeah.
Um, I think the part-time job one is easier.
Because, well - maybe because, uh, it's more relevant to me because I just quit - quitted from my part-time job.  So, yeah, it's more relevant so it's easier for me to think about what to say.
Uh, I think the role play was easier because, uh, for the picture description you have to, uh, really think about where, when, why and how those things happened, like the - the mother and the child one, I thought they went to the beach because there were sand, but actually it's just a park, so, uh, it's kind of difference and difficult.
Thank you.
