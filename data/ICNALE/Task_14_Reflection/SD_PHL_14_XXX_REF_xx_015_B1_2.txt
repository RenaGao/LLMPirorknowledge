It was, I think it's, it's fine.
Ah, yes, I did.
I was able to answer all of the questions well.
A little bit.
Umm, I think I should, we should need more practice.  We should more, we should have more assessments like this n order for us to, to, to ah, regain our confidence in speaking English.
Hmm, for me, it's smoking.  It's a lot easier, because a lot of people are really against smoking and it's now and it is now a policy.  And I think smoking is everywhere.  So, a lot of people are smoking and a lot of people are also being affected by smoking.  So, I, I think it is easier to, to talk about smoking, because we already have a lot of data.  We already have, have a lot of topics, studies upon it.
I prefer a role-play.
Because it's like a job interview.  Ah it, there are lots of several topics that are being asked to you.  And it will help you to, to be more prepared when you apply for a job someday.  Ah, it will also help you in, in your workplace someday when you talk to your manager, to your boss as when you report something.  One-on-one interview is, is something that we need to improve since a lot of people are really very, are nervous when it comes to one-on-one interview.
Thank you.
