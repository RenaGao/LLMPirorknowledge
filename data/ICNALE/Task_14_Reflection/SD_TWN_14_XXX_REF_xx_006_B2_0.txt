Hmm, yes, I think I did a good job.
Because I use English to express myself and I tell my teacher how I think about their question.  So, I think I'll try my best and I think I did a good job.
Hmm, a little nervous but not really.
Stop nervous.  It's okay.
I will tell them this and I will give the encourage.
Uh, I think they should stop feeling nervous about this review.  They can - they just have to think they are using another language and don't be afraid of using it in a wrong way.  If you don't feel nervous, then you can use it better.
Part-time job.
Because I also have some experience about part-time job and in the other situation, in the topic, they have to request the owner to refund both of us, but actually, in this situation, I don't think I can tell him to refund us.  I think it's all problem.  We don't know this rule in this restaurant and - and we come here.  So, we have to - we have to reset this situation.
Hmm, the role play.
Because it's more closely, more closely, hmm, related to my life, my daily life.
