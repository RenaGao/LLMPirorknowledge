Okay.
Sure. 
It was fun, good.
Ah, yeah, I guess so. I think I did a pretty good job.
The role play was a little bit tricky because it's in your favor for sure.
Yeah.
Um, I guess it's easy to say but just try not to be shy.  Basically be - be comfortable laughing at yourself.  I think that's the biggest one.  You make a mistake, you know you are going to make one, just you know, go ahead and just don't be afraid to laugh at yourself sometimes. 
Yeah.
I think the smoking one was a little bit easier to talk about probably.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  The role play you said?
Topic in general?
Okay, ah, I guess the topic in general.  Umm, I suppose the smoking one probably I guess it's something that everyone can I think really easily relate to I suppose even from a really young age because it kind of affects people, you know, sort of indirectly as well.
Yeah.
Um, I preferred the role play.  Even though it was more uncomfortable because it was more hard it - it was - it was more challenging.  I think this is like there was more to do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ah, no, that was great.  You were pretty friendly, you are easy to talk to, I think it was unintimidating.  I like it.
Thank you too.
