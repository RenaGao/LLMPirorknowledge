I could do better, but I am still terrified.  It's more like I am getting it done by fear.  I just don't like the idea of an interview.
It's not - it's not as much as I am speaking in English, it's more like I am terrified of the idea to do this interview.
I guess, they should talk more and then talk to - uh, talk more and then talk to people that are also speaking in English.

Yes.
Yes.
