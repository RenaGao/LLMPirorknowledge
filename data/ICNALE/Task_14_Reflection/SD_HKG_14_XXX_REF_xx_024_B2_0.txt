I - I think I did the job.  I think it is pretty - I think it is a pretty fun experience because in Hong Kong we - we are assumed to - we all know English but then whether we own a good level of English is another problem and I think this has just really, um, tries out on this, um, issue so yeah.
Oh, not at all, no, not at all.
I just - I think it is the adjustment on the psychological level you need to - you need to make - you need to tell yourself, yes, I can do this, I know how to speak English.  It is only through speaking that you can improve your English.  And if you don't speak then watching more TV shows, reading more English, writing more essays is not going to help you to communicate with people from another country, and I think it's just you need to be confident and brave and to just speak out what you think.
Yes.
Yes.
Um, I think part-time job is actually more relatable to me and so it's easier to talk about because it is more closely related to my daily life and the people around me.  Whereas, uh, smoking I mean, a - it is a hot issues, uh, currently because the Hong Kong Government is planning some, um, electronic, um, smoking devices but then, uh, because none of my friends, nor do I myself really smoke, I think it is quite a hard, uh, issue to elaborate on, yes.
Yes.
I think role play is actually more, uh - is actually better because it allows you to expand beyond the question, whereas, um, the pictures they - they - you - you're reset on a storyline, the only thing you can add is the - the details around the storyline and so speaking about your very own opinion in the question.
Yes.
Yes, no problem.
