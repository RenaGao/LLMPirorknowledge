Yes sir.
It was very good sir, first, uh, good experience, English language and also build our confidence. 
Not more be - uh, because our presentation also boost us very much and also teacher's coordinations that they confidented with XXX  courage.
Sir, actually, we should speak.
Speak, speak, speak.  And when you speak the mistake can - uh, we can realize after some time, Ki , some - when we are speaking with some professional that we point out our mistakes.  When he will - he or she will point out mistake, we can learn from them.
What - what kind of advice would you like to give to those friends who's - who's always feel nervous when speaking in English?  Uh, as I think they should first of all reading books is very important - encourage them, but they realize what they are feeling.
When they realize in something and they can coaching classing from some student, you can say also from teachers as re - reading is important---
---for English speaking.
Yes sir.
Smoking.
Because as I also don't like the smoking mainly and also we have a lot of material about that.  We listen from the government cam - uh, campaigns, etcetera, social campaigns, NGO, etcetera that are campaigning totally in the society, totally in the environment, etcetera.
Yes sir.
Role play.
Role play is easy as compared to the picture because, uh, in the picture - uh, picture speaks - uh, as we know, there is picture, uh, speaks - uh, speaks louder than words.
But sometime it is difficult to identify what the - uh, he want to say in the picture.  We cannot realize.  But in the role play, we almost realize the most thing that what he or she is saying.
Thank you.
