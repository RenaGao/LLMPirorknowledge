It was quite interesting.
Yeah.
I did - I'm sure I did my best.
Uh yes.
Uh, I think, uh to - to speak English we need a - we may have a, uh, confidence.
That might help to, uh, reduce our nervous when we speak English.
Because most of the Koreans think that, uh, it's more nervous for them to speak English with, uh, Korean - to Korean.
Rather than speaking with English speaker.
So, I think it's - I think it's because of a lack of confidence.
Because it's common to have a, uh, like think about the reputation - reputations if they talk about other Korean.
Yeah.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Well, uh, part-time - I think part-time job was more - more easier 
Because it's, uh, I'm quite far from the smoke so I don't really understand how smokers think. 
But, uh, on the other hand.
As a non-smoker, I can explain it---
---why I hate smoke in the restaurant.
But yeah, also, uh, it's easier for me to speak about part-time job because I have experienced very recently.
Yeah.
So, it was more easy.
Yeah.
My prefer?
Uh, well, it's obvious for me that explain about the picture is the easier---
---than the role play, because role play needs more, uh, variety of the vocabularies that you have to use.
And you can't expect how they react.
So, it's quite more difficult I would say.
Thank you.
