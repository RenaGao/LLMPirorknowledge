It - I think - I think it is not very bad and con - uh, and a lot of task is - can - made me like thinking - think about - about the environment, about around - all around, maybe not just education.
Uh, I - I am not sure like half-half.

Yes.
Yes, a lot - I feel nervous a lot but in - in one of the task I - very a lot, more than this.
I think we should practice or - or just sometime you have to release your stress.
Release the stress before you talking.
Yeah.
I think, uh, smoking - nonsmoking is easier because I - I just have experience about this.
Yes.
Role plays, yes.
I - I prefer role plays, of course.
Because I - you can create your own like you - your own speech and you don't have to stress about the picture.  The picture is more - more complicated.

Thank you very much.
