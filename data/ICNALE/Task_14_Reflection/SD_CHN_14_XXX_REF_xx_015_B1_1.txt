Umm, not very nervous.
Umm, you know, I have a friend, she is good at to speaking English and when I talking with her, she always - she - she always hurts me very sad - sadly.  And so I - I think maybe if - if - if my friend, I - I - I should, eh - you know, the - the people who you are talking with is can - can hurt you very sadly and very careful.  And she - maybe she will let you feel, um, it - it's okay, maybe in the school maybe I can't speak very well but she is always hurt - she - she is always hurting to me.  So may - maybe the people who is nervous to speak English can - can - can - can do some ex - ex - exercise.
Umm, part-time job.
Um, I - I - I just feel the smoke - the smoking topic in your restaurant is very difficult.
Yeah.
Maybe the picture.
The - the picture is - I think it's easy to thought - it - it have many, you know, any picture have the story, so you - you don't - yeah, you - you don't need to let other people to - how to - uh - you - you - you don't let - you don't need to really to talk with other people you just---
