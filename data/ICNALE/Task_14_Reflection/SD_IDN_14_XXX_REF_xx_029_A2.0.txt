Yeah, I am really enjoying this interview because yeah, sometimes I feel a good because I can speak English.  Sometime I feel yeah a little bit nervous.
Yeah.
A little bit nervous.
Hmm, maybe just communicating with the interview and then just do - just do it.
I like about smoking.
Because uh, it's social problem I think.  So a lot of people don't like about smoke.  And then because they can uh, have a negative impact for another people, so it's very interesting for us for discuss about that.
Uhm, I liked picture description  
Yeah, because I can try to imagine the picture and then I can describe a lot of things by look at that picture also.
Okay.
