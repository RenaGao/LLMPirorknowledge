Um, I can relate because I was a part-time worker when I was a university student.
Either was okay but if I was a non-native speaker then the picture cards would be easier to possibly do the interview with but as a native speaker I feel comfortable with both.
Oh, it was interesting and I am just very curious of what kind of data they can get from all these interviews so  
Well, thank you.
