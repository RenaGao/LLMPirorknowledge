At first, it was really - I was really nervous because this is my first time having this kind of interview.
Yes, I think I did good job.  But the first part or the earlier part of the interview, I was a bit nervous.
Yes.
I think we should be more laid back or relaxed.  I think we should also practice, take time to practice English and then yes, be ready for situations that can occur like giving our situations I need to describe or I need to take part on, we should be ready for that.
I think it would be - an easy topic, the uneasier topic the part-time job.
Because I think I - I could relate more on that.  I have - I have experienced internship while having the studies and yes, it luckily for me, I don't need - I don't need the internship at that time my parents support my studies, so I could easily say I can set aside the internship and focus more on the studies.
I think the role-playing part is better immersion.
Because it really takes the reader on the   it really takes the reader on the situation, it makes the reader feel that he or she is in that situation and gives out feel chances to or few decisions for him or her to meet.
But it is easier to express because it does not follow any - any set of rules or instructions.
Thank you.
