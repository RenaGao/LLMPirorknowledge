Is it in Korean or in English?
Uh, well, I was kind of nervous because I might get some words that I don't know but I understand all of it and I liked it, yeah---
---because there was, uh, well description and the pictures, so it was comfortable for me to answer. 
Maybe.
I'm confident about my skills but I don't know about this situation so---
Mm-hmm.
Mmm, I did feel nervous because I might heard some words that I don't know but I'm not nervous in speaking English.

Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Umm, well, both were kind of difficult but I think part-time job was better.
Because it's in my situation, I'm in that foot - I'm in that shoe so I need to earn money then I can explain how I'm going to use it and also I concentrate on the study that's all expla - explanation so I think that was better.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, the picture was better because, you know like, it was easier
Because I can just describe all the situation drawn there so---
But when it comes to explaining this role playing, I have to think of my situation so that was kind of hard.
Okay.
