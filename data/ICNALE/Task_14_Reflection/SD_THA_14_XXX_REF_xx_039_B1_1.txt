It's funny because I love speaking and that makes me practice my English a lot.
I think I do.
Because I talk - today I talked a lot of English that I have never really speak before because I don't often talk to my foreign teacher because I don't have time.
Because they are - he is just teaching us and not - not - uh, you don't ask a lot of questions that much.
A little bit.
Uh, just make myself relaxed and that's it.
Yes.
Smoking.
Because I don't like the smoke like.
The picture.
Because it's easier to talk we have pictures and we can understand easily and this is just, uh, the text that not have a picture, so some words I don't know.
Thank you.
