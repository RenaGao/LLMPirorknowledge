Today's interview was great.  I think it was very, very nice to have this interview.
I think I did a good job since, yeah.
Yeah, I think so.
I think so because the answers were, the answers needed were based on my opinions and based on my insight.  It's not based on fact.  So yeah, I think so.
Before, before entering the room, I, I kind of was because the person before me ah, they took a long time and they were discussing outside then ah, I kept on stuttering, I kept on having long pauses and breaks.  So, I was thinking what if I also did the same.
Umm, I think ah, what we should do is to practice it every day and we should not be scared of ah, making mistakes while speaking, because that is how we grow, that is how we learn what to do.
I think it was easier for me to talk about the non, non-smoking part, because it, it greatly affects me in my everyday life.  I, I encounter smokers, non-smokers, yes.  But with the part-time job, it's more of a personal, personal information about the person.
I preferred the pictures, because it gives me a visualization of what I have to say.
