Yeah, great.
All right.
Well, you mean practicing my English?
It's comfortable like we are checking.
Yeah.
Uh, did a good job?  Um, no.  I think sometimes I miss my - I miss, uh, the key point of your question.  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes I didn't directly, uh, answer your question.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And many students say that they feel nervous when speaking English; did you feel nervous too today?
No.
Um, try to speak English with your close friend and those friends who will - will direct your - your - maybe your grammar or your voicing views, and they won't damage you.  Yeah, they will teach you and make you improve your English.
It's really important that you speak - speak out anything you like, anything you want even if the grammar is wrong or - or the words.  You don't have any - you don't have any ideas of that words.  You just explain - just express.
Yeah.
Um, part-time job.
Because I have a part-time job now.  And I think it's really a good experience to tell - to tell you that having a part-time job and also having your assignment both - both of them really you know tough for me now.
Yeah.
Uh, role play.
Um, because I think imagining that situation by myself.
I won't, uh, limit - limited - limit the picture that - that you give me.  Yeah.
And I didn't have my own im - image.  Yeah, and tell, um, that you ask my question - uh, ask me questions then I can directly answer your questions.
Yeah.
Really?
Thank you.
Thank you.
