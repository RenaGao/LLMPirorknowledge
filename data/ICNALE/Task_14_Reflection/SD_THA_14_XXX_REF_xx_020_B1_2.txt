Yes, it's maybe.
It's fine.
Yeah, if I have a chance, I will practice more my conversation and more words, so I can speak more fluently.
Today, I didn't feel nervous.
Um, this is difficult.  Uh, uh, I will give them an advice that you have to try - uh, try to speak it but not - you need to left your fears behind and then try them just - just - just try them and then give yourself a chance to do things that - that - that can improve yourself, something like this.
