 Umm, no, not.
 Uh---
 Umm, I, I don't have, I don't, I don't have so much vocab --- vocabulary.
 So, uh, so for example, a cigarette is okay.
 Uh, okay, uh-huh, so---  
 Uh-uh, at first, I --- I come --- come up with, I don't come, came up, and I didn't come up with the word of smoke, smoke, smoking.
 Uh.
 Yeah.
 Uh, to try to think that speaking Eng --- English is same with speaking Japanese.
 Part-time job.
 Why?
 Umm, because I --- I --- I used do --- to do part-time job, but I don't, uh, I --- umm --- I haven't smoke, smoked, uh, I haven't smoked before, so---  
 Yeah, so, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Uh, this --- this --- this time picture.  
 Uh, because uh role --- role playing is, for example, the, umm, for example, when I --- I never do, uh, I never called that --- that --- the---  
 Uh, and I think, uh, oh, uh, uh, yeah, I --- actually I think that, I --- actually if --- if teacher say that you should uh stop part-time job, I think I will stop.
 Thank you.

 Hmm.
 Yes, but I am not so good at speaking.
 Umm, uh, umm, once in a week, because uh there is a post-doc uh from Chin --- China, so uh I talk with him with English.
 Yes.
 Uh, topics, uh, I want to talk about my research or his or her research, because I am not so uh used to uh speaking --- speaking about my research in English.
 So, I want to uh have a --- a chance to speak uh about my research---  
 Um-hmm-hmm-hmm, uh, umm, in daily life, uh, we don't have so much uh chances to speak, but, uh, umm, fortunately, we --- we have a post --- post-doc, so uh I umm I make my effort to talk with him.
 Uh, but --- but in many cases, he try   to speak in Japanese.
 Uh, uh, sorry, could you repeat?
 Um-hmm-hmm-hmm.
 Uh, I like, uh, I like to talk with uh, uh, umm, face-to-face.  
 Uh, not group discussion.
 Uh, it's because uh it's uh easier to, uh, umm, it's easier to make, make myself understood.
 Uh, uh, in group discussion, uh, it's very hard to uh hear o --- others' uh umm opinions, uh, as there are so many opinions that I can't understand all of them.
 Uh, most important uh is umm maybe reading.
 Because, uh, in many cases, for example, traveling, uh, we --- we can, uh, umm, if we can read, uh, we --- we can --- umm --- uh it's very hard to say but---  
 Uh-huh-huh, umm, uh, there are so many in uh advertisement or umm uh --- uh if we can't speak or listen, uh just --- just write down and uh show --- show it, uh if we uh we can't com --- communicate with each other.
 So uh writing and uh reading is a umm very important.
 But uh if we can't listen, uh, it's not, uh no prob --- umm not so much problem.
