Uh, that was good and I also enjoyed the feelings of that interview that in a restaurant also---
I guess I'm getting - I have told you - I have told you that the feelings of oneself present in that situations like, uh, the task you have given to me in the park I realize the feelings or all the emotional feelings to the park and that was giving me the whole scenario in front of my eyes.
Yes.  I feel nervous because it's not my native - my native language and I - that's difficultly in speaking that language.
Yes, we have to give them a complete sense of that language, like, uh, children was given a full idea of their native language time by time when a child born, he was given to speak.  He was try to speak his native language.  Same likewise we have to given the people a chance to initialize their speaking skills in English that's why.
Yes, I would like to tell them that they most use one-to-one conversation in English language.  That is more preferable in and most best for improving your speaking or as well as listening skills.  Both the things are.
Uh, non-smoking.
Uh, because that is a convincing matter that you have to, uh, convince a person that is doing a bad thing.
You are talking about the child.
Uh, okay, non-smoking.
Which I miss you.  Okay, okay, I got the point.  
Yes.  Uh, yes, I like to - I like that topic because of the - uh, I have most - most of the options to convince you because non-smoking is - smoking is a bad thing and it's a negative point for you.  And you can speak well on the other person's negative point so that I have more explaining forward for it.
Uh, I prefer to the part one.
Okay, okay, okay.  Uh, I prefer to the picture description.

Because they are easily being describable and there are no, uh, discussion between the two persons.  I have just - I have all my course to explain the things, uh, each and everything, uh, rights to say I have right.
Thank you.
