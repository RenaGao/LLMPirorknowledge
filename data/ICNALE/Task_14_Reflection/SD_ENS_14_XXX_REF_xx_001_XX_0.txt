All right sir.
It was fun and I enjoyed it because I have always, you know, loved this kind of one-to-one conversation.
I don't think so because no one praises himself and I - I should be given the point by - by my supervisor or whoever interviews me.
Yeah, I will - I will like to see if they are non-native speakers and they are nervous in speaking English, first of all they should relax, calm down, and think properly of what they want to say before they say it.  They shouldn't rush at all what they want to say because it is only native speakers that can, you know, easily bump in and bump out because they knows   how to get in and get out.  Yeah, so I advise the non-native speakers to relax and target their language target and just speak calmly and not rush as native speaker.
Yes sir.
Both.
Yes sir.
Because the - the both were easier for me to talk about because my feelings about both topics were my own personal - my own personal thinking, that makes it more easier for me to talk about both topics.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Both sir.
Yeah, because the - the both were - almost like 70% were understood which is the picture - the picture play.  And the role play was 100% because you could - you could read and understand what you are reading.  But the picture was - there was no words.  You have to look at a picture and just guess what's going on here, so that was about 70%.
No comments, just generally I want to say thank you very much for pushing me so hard to - to learn what I haven't learned before and to say what I haven't said before. So I want - I appreciate that.
All right sir, thank you very much.  I appreciate it.
