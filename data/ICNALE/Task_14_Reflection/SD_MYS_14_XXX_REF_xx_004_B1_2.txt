Okay.
It was, ah, it was fun.
And also nerve-racking.
Because, ah-hmm, I am very shy I guess.
Ah-hmm, I think I could have done better, but okay.
Huh.
Yeah.
What should I do?
Oh.  Like drinking lots of water.
But also like one way to not feel nervous is I think you have to - we have to practice more so that we won't be nervous when speaking another language.
The part-time job.
Because I worked before.
So that's why I think I could relate more to that situation rather than the smoking.  
Yeah.
The smoking - smoking rather role play.  
Oh so sorry, rather than picture description, I - I'll rather do.
Yeah rather than role play.
Because the role play - because I think it's more easier to describe things rather than - rather than the role play.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's more easier because it has pictures and I just have to describe rather than this I'll have to think and then I'll have to like see word by word rather than just describing this.
