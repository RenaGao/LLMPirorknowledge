It was okay a bit.
I think so.
Because I was able to answer all of your questions not not completely but I was able the questions.
Yes.
I think umm maybe to maybe the problem is not in the interviewer or in the in the place but I think it's just in us who is being interviewed because we think we are lacking or we are not confident enough to speak in English.
The job part-time job.
Because umm it was an it was easy for me because I the point was clear and the intention umm that the student should not be working because they have a right to studies and it's their parents' responsibility to raise them and to get them to school.

Thank you.
