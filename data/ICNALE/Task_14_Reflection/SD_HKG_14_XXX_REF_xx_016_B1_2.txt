Hmm, I think I am okay.
Uh, at least I understand the question and I really enjoyed doing the picture and making story upon.  And the role play, especially for the part-timer.
Uh, not quite.
Um, one time I went to an exchange program in Canada, and this is what a professor there said.  She said, speaking English is not about, uh, you're fluent or not, it' about how you're feeling about it.  It's like if you're feeling comfortable with English, then you will go fluent and you can express yourself completely.  And I think it is for the students here to - if they - he or she want to improve her English or his English and the only way to get to the comfortable way is like speaking more and to listen more and to use more.  That's it.
Part-time.
Because it's more related.  Uh, normally we - you know, Hong Kong people is not that bold and there were not really too complaint unless they're really angry about it.  The smoking is something that we have already got used to it and you normally when go to, uh, uncles, or maybe, you know what I mean.
And to say, hey, hey, stop smoking, you know, you would get scold, you get blamed, why I can't smoke here like this and then it is what it is.
So, the part-time job is more related and smoking is not.
Hmm, picture.
Because role play you need to imagine more, you need to add more details to that and making it more realistic.
While in the picture thing you already have some kind of references and it is more easier to make up the story.
