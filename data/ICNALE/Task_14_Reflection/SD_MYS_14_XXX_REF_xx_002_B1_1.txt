Um, I think it went well.  Ah, it was manageable.  It was manageable I think.
It was okay.
Ah, yes, I felt nervous.
Ah, all we can do is I think just try to speak in English.  Ah, anytime you can, anywhere, whoever just try to speak even if it's with yourself.  If you don't have anyone around.  Ah, it's not wrong to talk to yourself I think.
I think restaurant.
Because um, I just asked the owner to refund my money unlike the - unlike the part-time job I have to persuade my  SB  to let me keep my job.  I think it's hard for me ah, to persuade someone for doing my thing.
I prefer the pictures.
Because ah, the pictures that  you had  so you just have to describe based on the situation, okay.  So at least you know what's going on unlike the role play you have to act what is going to happen.  It's hard for me to tell, to do.
Thank you.
