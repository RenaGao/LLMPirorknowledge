Yes, you can.
It was good.
Yes, I tried my best.
I tried my best, uh, I'll - because, uh, the time or this basically was a sudden interview.  I don't have any idea---
---what you're going to ask me.
Yes because we, most of the time, we take English as a subject, we don't take it as a language---
---so I'll - everyone wants to speak with full force or with full vocabulary and with grammar, when we think about those aspect, so definitely everyone feel hesitation to speak English.
We - we should, uh - because when, uh, English people came into Pakistan and they speak Urdu, we enjoy them, so we have to some sort of, uh, opinion in our mind, if we speak some wrong words, so there is nothing.
So, uh, my advice just speak, if you speak, then the person who is sitting in front of you can tell you, this is wrong.  If you didn't speak, so there is no, uh, margin to improve.
Smoking.
Because, uh, smoking relates to every person.  Um, every person did not go to the universities or doing part-time jobs, so smoking is everywhere in entire world.
Uh, role play I think.
Because, uh, role play, in - in that I can read and understand.  In picture description, for me, it was a bit difficult, uh, for example, I understand first picture, so then in second or third, I was in between what is the meaning of the second and in the third one.
Thank you.
