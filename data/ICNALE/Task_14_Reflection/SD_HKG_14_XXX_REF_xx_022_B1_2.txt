Um, quite, I think.
At least I completed.  But, I - I think some of my present - uh, some of my maybe interview performance is not very good as I am maybe sometime hesitate and some grammatically mistake appear so not really good.
Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Um, just at the beginning but not at the later and some - eh, but sometimes when I cannot find some vocabulary outdoors, uh, when I find some mistake I made I will feel nervous.
Um, just say it, nothing - nothing more as a - even you nervous, uh, you still need to complete everything, so why - why nervous.
Yeah.
I think part-time job is more easier for me as, uh, it's more close to my daily life and non- smoking is not close.  But I am more familiar on that topic as I am doing part-time job now so it's more easier for me to answer the question.
Uh, maybe role play.
Uh, it has more area for me to, uh, speak but, uh, if there is a - some pictures for me and I think my, uh, creativity - no - uh, maybe it's limited and some - some of the maybe, uh, - the range of speaking or something, uh, is limited so I - I just can according, uh, to the picture to speak out what I really think.  Uh, some of the vocabulary or some words, uh, cannot come out at the time being if I am just following the pictures so yeah.
Thank you.
