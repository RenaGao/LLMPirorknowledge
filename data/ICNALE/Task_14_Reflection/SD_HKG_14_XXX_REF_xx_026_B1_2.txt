Hmm.
I - I think I have a little bit nervous because and normally I don't - I don't care grammar when I am speaking in English but now in the interview so I - I speak every single word and - in my mind that rather is it - there was a gram - there was a grammatical - grammatical mistake, the pronunciation.  So, it may be affected a little bit, uh, when compared to - to other - to others.
In this---
---interview, yes.
Um, I think practice is crucial for student that - um, before they speak in English in - no matter - in what events or what - to all speak to who - to whom because and when you have practiced enough that - and you know how to speak, how to pronounce correct - you know the correct grammar, then - when you have all the things prepared, so you can't become best - best in speaking in English to others, no matter this is, uh, non-native speaker or native speaker.  So, I think practice is the first step and also you have to do more - you have to do more which means, and you speak English more with others.
I think part-time job, um, is a little bit easier because it is my own XXX   subject in some sort my own experience that I can use what happened to me and as a material for me to - to respond to this question.  And smoking, although I don't prefer smoking, but people around me they - they also don't smoke, they don't smoke so I cannot tell from the perspective of the smoker, so I think maybe based on my own experience is more - is much easier.
I feel I - I prefer role play more than description because role play you have to - it is just like actor and you will give your best in that situation different rather than in description because description is just that's very objective way in - in the third person you are just descripting   some - some fact you saw but role play this is about your own - uh, it's about your own - your own - yourself that it helps you to - to have more - more emotion or more thing to talk about.
Hmm.
