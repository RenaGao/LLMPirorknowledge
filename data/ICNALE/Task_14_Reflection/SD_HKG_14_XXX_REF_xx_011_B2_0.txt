Uh, um, I - I - it - it is a good interview but I think my performance is not so really, um, acceptable for me because I don't speak quite fluent in, um, in English, uh, uh, because I, um, I cannot immediately think those work   in Chinese and con - convert it to English so I need to practice more, yes.
Okay, okay.
Uh, I - I feel quite nervous because, um, uh, I think I cannot - I - I - I accept I often cannot, um, immediate to convert the meaning from Chinese into cant - uh, into English to the foreigners and - and I'm afraid that they cannot understand my, uh, expression.  And they will - they will feel, um, uh - they will feel, uh - they will feel not happy and so I - I still have some pressure when we - when I - when I talk in English because this is not my mother language.
Uh, the most important things that we can do is to read more and speak more because, uh, through reading we can, uh, learn or acquire more, uh, English works   and that can, uh, use in the normal conversation and through speaking, uh, we can those word that we acquire during conversation and these two, um, process is a - a - a good process to improve English level.
Um, I think part-time job is more easy to - for me to talk about because I have several experience in it because I have worked in the airport and also I am working, uh, as a - in museum now but for smoking I - I just learned those, um, um, advantage and - um, I'm sorry - I just learned those disadvantages in smoking during maybe, um, uh, liberal study or food or news but I do not have a - any experience in smoking for my, uh, personal experience.  So, I do not quite familiar with, uh, in smoking, how smoking will affect, uh, XXX   health or, uh, other non-smokers health, yeah.
Thank you.
