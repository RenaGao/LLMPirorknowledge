Um, it's very interesting and kind of challenging in a sense. 
I - I guess fair. 
Ah, breathe deep, relax, think about positive thoughts and - and try not to - try not to focus on - on your negative feelings.
I think the part-time job.
Partly because I have had a part-time job in the past and working for - for a future that's a little bit far away is - is challenging and smoking and negative - negative responses to smoking is not very comfortable.
Ah, well partly because I like the part-time,  the working for a future was a more interesting topic.  So I like that one better so--- 
Picture format.
It was conducted very easily and yeah, it's easy to feel a little bit on - put on - put on a little--- 
On the spot.  Get a little bit nervous but generally it's been - been okay. 
Thank you very much.  Thank you.
