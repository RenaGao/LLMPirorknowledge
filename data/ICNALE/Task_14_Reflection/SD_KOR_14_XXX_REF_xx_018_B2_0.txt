Okay.
A little bit tough for me.
I'm not sure about it, just so-so.
A little bit than usual.
The simple way is just, you know, just speak a lot or listen a lot, yeah.
Okay.
I think part-time job---
---is---
---easier.
So, things are really tough for me, but you know, part-time job, I had experience of that situation.
But you know like, smoking in restaurant I never saw and experienced that situation before.  So, yeah.
I think that's the only one reason.
Okay.
I think picture description is better.
Well, I can make sentences in my head by looking at a picture---
And that makes me easy - easier to speak.
Okay, yeah.
Thank you.
