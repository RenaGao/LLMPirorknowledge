Okay.
Mmm, not very good and not very bad.
Because, uh, the interview just like to be able to talk about something.
Um, and to express your idea.  That's very normal, I think.
No.
Um, if you always feel nervous, I think you should practice - practice more and to communicate with many for - many foreigners.  You should make friends with them.  And also you need to, uh, speak by yourself ---
---to practice.  I think that is very important.  And speaking English is just - it's just a way to communicate with other people.  Uh, just like you speak Chinese we speak your mother tongue, you won't - you won't be very nervous, I think.
Uh, yes, sometimes because, uh, I always - I always stand - uh, I always stand in front of the mirror to say - uh, to speak, I think so.
I don't know why.  Just - just I think it's very interesting.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, I think part time job is---
---a little easier for me.
Uh, because - because it's about, uh, in my opinion, it's about, uh, financial independence---
---that's very important for me, and also I think more about it.
But the smoking is very normal.  It's - it's a very normal problem in - in our country, and uh, many people just think its harm to your health.
I have no many ideas to say something.
Yeah.
Uh, role play I think.
Because role play is more interesting and also you can to express your ideas very freely, but if you - but if you describe the pictures, uh, maybe sometimes the words is not very easy for you to speak.
Okay.
