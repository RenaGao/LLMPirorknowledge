Because I - you know, I was not very - for smoke for - or the talking here because I was about 1 year or 2 years and didn't have chance to speak English like this long time.
I don't think so.
Yeah, I think the way - best way is, you know, a lot of people who speak English, they - why they nervous?  Why they don't want to speak English, the reason, I think the most important thing is they afraid to make mistake.
But you know, as you are foreigner, you don't - English native, it's very normal to make a mistake, right?  Only the English speaker who didn't - who doesn't matter what a - what a mistake you have to make.  The only thing is to speak it out.
Right?  If that ..., how to say, if you - the people who you are talking with - talking to is who can gather all your points, who can - can understand what you say.  That's enough.  To the mistake, to the grammar, okay, it's very important too, but when you have time, you can correct these mistakes, all right?
The first thing I think is speak it out.
Okay, I would say the non-smoking.
Fiction?
Ah-ah, I---
I - I - I would think the - the picture.
