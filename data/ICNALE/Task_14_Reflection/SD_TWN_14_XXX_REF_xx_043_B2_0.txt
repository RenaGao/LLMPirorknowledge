Uh, it's - um, I feel relaxed.
But I think my English speaking is not well.
Because I think you are kind.
Yeah.  And the topic is not too - not too hard---
---for me to answer.
Um, not very good.
Because my English speaking and I can - because my speaking limitation made me cannot, uh, totally express what I - I - my thoughts.
Um, a little bit because I major in English, but I really - I always, um, um, um compare with my classmate and I think I'm not very good into it.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, practice more.
Yeah.
Um, I think part-time job---
---because I - I'm more close to this issue.
Uh, I like the role play.
Because it has more space for me to, uh, create.
Anything I want.
Thank you.
