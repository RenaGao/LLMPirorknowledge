Yes.
Okay.
I think it's quite -- going quite well, I -- as I -- as I wanted.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Uh, because for me as I -- as I previously mentioned that
That I'd like to talk in English.  It's my leisure.  It's my -- I can say it's like, uh, at the level as my Bahasa because I really like to talk in English.
So for me to have this conversation with someone in English for me is like it.
Yes.
Personally for me to -- to when speaking.
You don't want to get nervous is, uh, take your time, construct your words and then when you are ready to speak then you speak.  So you need to carefully construct your words.
Uh, personally for me is the -- the non-smoking one.
Because, uh, I -- I am someone who really disagree with smoking so I really disagree with so did I since I do some research about smoking and I know the best there is some good stuff but not as much as the best stuff so for me to have talk about smoking is like for me telling you the information that I have gathered through my life.
I prefer more the role play.
Because, uh, when we -- we are doing role-play we can like construct the scene ourselves so that this the scope is much more wide because when picture you need to talk about the picture, but when you are role-play you can spread the image in addition.
Sure.
