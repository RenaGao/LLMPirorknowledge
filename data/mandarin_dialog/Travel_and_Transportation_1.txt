peaker A (NS):** Hi there! You look a bit lost. Do you need help finding something?

**Speaker B (Mandarin NS):** Uh, yes, please. I am looking for hotel. How to say... um, a place for sleep?

**Speaker A:** A hotel? Sure, I can help with that. Do you know the name of the hotel?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes, I think it is called... um, Green... Green House Hotel?

**Speaker A:** Oh, the Green House Hotel! I know where that is. It’s not too far from here.

**Speaker B:** That is good. I am... how you say... not sure where is front and back?

**Speaker A:** No worries, I can guide you. Do you see that big red building over there?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, I see. The red... uh, building, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. You’ll want to walk past that building and then turn left at the corner.

**Speaker B:** Past building, then left... okay, and then?

**Speaker A:** After you turn left, walk straight for about two blocks. You’ll see the hotel on your right.

**Speaker B:** Two blocks... and hotel is on... right, yes?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that’s correct. Do you think you’ll manage to find it okay?

**Speaker B:** I think... yes, I can. But, um, if I lost, maybe I ask someone again?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, just ask anyone nearby. People here are quite friendly.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much. You are very, um, helpful!

**Speaker A:** It’s my pleasure. Are you visiting here for vacation?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I, um, visit for holiday. Want to see... uh, many sights.

**Speaker A:** That sounds wonderful! If you need more recommendations, feel free to ask.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will. Thank you! I go now to... um, check-in?

**Speaker A:** Yes, go check in. Have a great stay at the hotel!

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much. Have a nice day!

**Speaker A:** You too! Enjoy your visit!

**Speaker B:** I will try. Goodb
