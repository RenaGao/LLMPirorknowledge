**Speaker A:** Oh, you mean a stapler?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, stapler! I need to buy one for my, um, my office work.

**Speaker A:** Sure, the staplers are in aisle three. Do you need help finding them?

**Speaker B:** Uh, thank you, but I try to find first. If not can find, I will ask you.

**Speaker A:** Sounds good! Just let me know if you need any assistance.

**Speaker B:** (a few minutes later) Excuse me, I look in aisle three, but I not see stapler.

**Speaker A:** No problem! Sometimes the shelves can be a bit confusing. Let me show you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, thank you. I appreciate your help.

**Speaker A:** Here we are! These are the staplers. Do you have a specific type in mind?

**Speaker B:** Um, I think, how to say, simple is okay? Not too big.

**Speaker A:** Alright, we have these compact ones. They're easy to use and not bulky.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that is good. And, um, do you have staple with it?

**Speaker A:** Yes, they come with a pack of staples. You can also buy extra if you need more.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay. I will take this one. And, um, can I ask another question?

**Speaker A:** Of course! What else can I help you with?

**Speaker B:** I need, um, paper clip. For holding paper together, but no staple.

**Speaker A:** Yes, paper clips are in aisle four. They're just around the corner.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, I will go look now. You are very helpful!

**Speaker A:** You're welcome! Don't hesitate to ask if you need more help.

**Speaker B:** I will. Thank you again. Have a good day!
