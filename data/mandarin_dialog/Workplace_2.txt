peaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi, welcome to the team! I'm glad you're here. Could you tell me a bit about what you've worked on before?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Uh, thank you! I happy to be here. Before, I work in marketing. Um, I do... how to say... manage, uh, social media?

**Speaker A:** Social media management, got it. That’s really useful! Here, we’ll need your help with planning a new campaign. Are you familiar with creating content calendars?

**Speaker B:** Content calendar... ah, yes, I know. Um, I make them before, but maybe not same like here.

**Speaker A:** No problem, I can help with that. Here, we usually plan content a month in advance. Do you find that timeframe manageable?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I think is okay. One month, good. Um, sometimes, I do only two weeks before.

**Speaker A:** Alright, that’s a good start. We can adjust as needed. Do you have any questions about the tools we use, like Hootsuite or Buffer?

**Speaker B:** Uh, Hootsuite, I know little. Buffer... not much. Maybe... you show me?

**Speaker A:** Of course. I’ll set up a time later today to walk you through them. How about our target audience? Are you familiar with who we’re reaching out to?

**Speaker B:** Um, I read some document. Audience is, uh, young adults? But maybe more detail I need.

**Speaker A:** Yes, mostly young adults, ages 18 to 34. They’re interested in tech and lifestyle content. We can go over more specifics in our meeting.

**Speaker B:** Sounds good. I will prepare some idea for content. Is this okay?

**Speaker A:** Perfect, that’s exactly what we need. If you have any topic ideas, feel free to share them. How comfortable are you with using our style guide?

**Speaker B:** Style guide... I think I understand. Um, use same tone and language, yes?

**Speaker A:** Exactly, keep it consistent. Let me know if you need any examples or if anything is unclear.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will check and ask if, uh, problem. Oh, um, can I ask about team meeting time?

**Speaker A:** Sure, our team meetings are every Wednesday at 10 a.m. Is that time good for you?

**Speaker B:** Yes, 10 a.m. is good. I will make sure to... uh, prepare.

**Speaker A:** Great! Don’t worry, these meetings are quite relaxed, and they’re a good opportunity to bring up questions or ideas.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. I... I feel better now. Um, also, deadline for campaign planning?

**Speaker A:** We aim to finalize plans by the end of the month. That gives us enough time to make adjustments. 

**Speaker B:** End of month, I understand. I will work hard to meet.

**Speaker A:** Awesome, I’m sure you’ll do great. Let’s catch up again tomorrow to see how you’re settling in.

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you for help. I will see you tomorrow.

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! Looking forward to it. See you th
