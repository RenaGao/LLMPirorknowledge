peaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi Xiao Li! I heard you were upset after our last meeting. Can we talk about it?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker, MS):** Oh, yes, Xiao Ming. I was a bit... um, how to say... confused?

**Speaker A:** Confused? Can you tell me what happened?

**Speaker B:** Um, you say we meet at, uh, nine o'clock, but I think you mean the morning?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I see. I meant 9 p.m. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay! I thought you say a.m. 

**Speaker A:** It's my fault. I should have been clearer. Did you wait long?

**Speaker B:** Yes, a little bit. I wait for one hour and then go home.

**Speaker A:** I'm really sorry about that. I can imagine it was frustrating.

**Speaker B:** Yes, but now is okay. I just want to understand. Thank you for explain.

**Speaker A:** Of course. Next time, I will make sure to say morning or evening.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that is good idea. We can say "p.m." or "a.m." also, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. That helps a lot. How can I make it up to you?

**Speaker B:** Um, maybe we have coffee next time? I, um, still enjoy our talk.

**Speaker A:** I'd love that! How about this weekend? I'll be sure to mention the time clearly.

**Speaker B:** Yes, this weekend is good. Um, around, uh, afternoon?

**Speaker A:** Sure, let's say 2 p.m. at the café we like?

**Speaker B:** Perfect! I look forward to it. Thank you for being so understanding.

**Speaker A:** No problem at all. I appreciate you bringing this up.

**Speaker B:** I think it is good to talk about... um, problem. It makes things better.

**Speaker A:** I agree. Communication is important. Thanks again for letting me know.

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you too. See you at the café!

**Speaker A:** See you then, Xiao Li! Take care until we meet.

**Speaker B:** Okay, take care. Bye-b
