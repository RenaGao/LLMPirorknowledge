peaker A (Native Speaker):** Hi, welcome to the apartment! How’s the move going?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Um, hello! It is good, thank you. I still have many box, but almost done.

**Speaker A:** That's great to hear. So, have you had a chance to cook anything yet?

**Speaker B:** Not yet. I think... uh, maybe tomorrow. I want to make my favorite meal.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that sounds exciting! What’s your favorite meal?

**Speaker B:** It is... um, how to say... noodles with meat and vegetable. In China, we call it "Zhajiangmian."

**Speaker A:** Ah, Zhajiangmian! I’ve heard of it. How do you prepare it?

**Speaker B:** First, I need to buy ingredient. I go to supermarket. Need noodle, pork, and... um, soybean paste?

**Speaker A:** Yes, soybean paste. Do you cook the pork first?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I cook pork with oil and onion. Then add paste, and, uh... some sugar and soy sauce for taste.

**Speaker A:** That sounds delicious. Do you add vegetables too?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. I use... um, cucumber and carrot. I cut, uh... slice them small.

**Speaker A:** Do you mix everything together with the noodles?

**Speaker B:** Um, no. I, uh... put noodle and then sauce on top. Vegetables last. Mix on plate.

**Speaker A:** That makes sense. It sounds really tasty! Do you usually make it spicy?

**Speaker B:** Sometimes I add chili. But, um, not too much. Do you like spicy?

**Speaker A:** I do enjoy some spice! What’s the hardest part about making Zhajiangmian?

**Speaker B:** Maybe... um, cook pork just right. Not too dry. It need practice, I think.

**Speaker A:** I can imagine. Do you serve it with any side dishes?

**Speaker B:** Sometimes soup. But usually, just noodle is okay. Easy to eat.

**Speaker A:** Well, I’d love to try it someday. Maybe we can cook together?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes! That would be fun. I can show you more Chinese food.

**Speaker A:** I’d love that. Thanks for sharing how you make your meal!

**Speaker B:** Thank you for listening. I hope you like it when I make.

**Speaker A:** I’m sure I will. Let me know if you need help unpacking.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you! I will ask if I need he
