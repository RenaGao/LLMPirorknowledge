peaker A (NS):** Hi, Xiao Mei! I've been curious about this for a while. What’s your favorite holiday in China?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Oh, hello! Um, my favorite holiday is, how to say... Spring Festival, yes!

**Speaker A (NS):** Spring Festival? You mean Chinese New Year?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** Yes, yes! Chinese New Year. It is very, um, important. Big holiday.

**Speaker A (NS):** That sounds wonderful! Can you tell me more about it? What do you do during the festival?

**Speaker B (Mandarin):** We... ah, we have big meal with family. Many, many food. And we do fire... um, fireworks, yes!
