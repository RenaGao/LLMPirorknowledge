peaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hi there! I heard you’re planning a group vacation. Do you need any help with that?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Ah, yes! We want to go somewhere, um, fun and relax. Maybe, uh, beach or mountain.

**Speaker A:** Both sound like great options! Do you have any destinations in mind?

**Speaker B:** We think about, uh, Hawaii or... how to say... um, those big mountain in Canada?

**Speaker A:** The Rockies?

**Speaker B:** Yes, Rockies! But, um, I not sure which one is better.

**Speaker A:** Well, Hawaii is perfect for beaches and relaxation, while the Rockies are great for hiking and nature. What do your friends prefer?

**Speaker B:** Some, they like beach. Others, um, like nature walk and see animal. Hard to decide!

**Speaker A:** Maybe you can do a vote or find a place with both options. How about somewhere like California? You can find beaches and mountains there.

**Speaker B:** Oh, California... Yes, that can work! But, um, what we do there?

**Speaker A:** You could visit places like Los Angeles for beaches and the Sierra Nevada for hiking. Have you thought about activities you all enjoy?

**Speaker B:** Activities... um, we like, uh, sightseeing, maybe shopping. Also, food! We want good food.

**Speaker A:** California has amazing food. You can try diverse cuisines, especially in cities like San Francisco or Los Angeles.

**Speaker B:** Mmm, sounds tasty! I think everyone will like that. But, transport... uh, how we go around?

**Speaker A:** Renting a car might be a good idea, so you can easily travel between cities and attractions.

**Speaker B:** Car rental... Yes, I see. And, uh, how long should we stay?

**Speaker A:** It depends on your schedule, but I’d say at least a week to really enjoy and relax.

**Speaker B:** Yes, one week is good. I will check with friends. Um, how about place to stay?

**Speaker A:** You could book hotels or maybe try Airbnb for more local experiences. Do you have a budget in mind?

**Speaker B:** Budget... um, not too expensive, but comfortable is important.

**Speaker A:** In that case, Airbnb might offer more affordable yet cozy options. You can split the cost among your group.

**Speaker B:** That is a good idea! I will tell them. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A:** You’re welcome! I’m sure you’ll have an amazing trip. Let me know if you need any more advice.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will. Thank you again! I feel more ready to plan now.

**Speaker A:** Happy to hear that! Enjoy your vacation planning.

**Speaker B:** I will. Goodbye for n
