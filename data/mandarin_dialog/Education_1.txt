Two friends, Xiaoyu and Lili, are part of a study group. Xiaoyu is trying to explain a challenging topic they learned in their economics class to Lili.

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** Hi Lili! Are you ready to go over the economics topic we discussed in class?

**Speaker B (Lili):** Um, yes, Xiaoyu. I am ready, but it’s, uh, difficult for me. Can you help with... um, the supply and demand curve?

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** Sure! The supply and demand curve shows how prices change when the supply of a good or demand for it changes.

**Speaker B (Lili):** Ah, okay. So, um... when demand is high, prices go up?

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** Exactly! And when there is more supply than demand, prices tend to go down.

**Speaker B (Lili):** Oh, I see. But, uh, what about equilibrium? How does it... happen?

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** Equilibrium is when supply equals demand. It’s the point where the supply and demand curves intersect.

**Speaker B (Lili):** Ah, intersect. So the price is stable there?

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** Yes, the market is balanced. No pressure to increase or decrease the price.

**Speaker B (Lili):** Hmm, and when does, uh, shift happen? Like, the curve move?

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** Good question! Shifts happen due to external factors like a change in consumer tastes or production costs.

**Speaker B (Lili):** Oh, so... um, if people want more, demand curve move to right?

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** Exactly! More demand shifts the curve to the right, and prices might increase.

**Speaker B (Lili):** And if production cost, uh, decrease, supply... it shift to right too?

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** Right again! Lower costs mean producers can make more, shifting the supply curve right.

**Speaker B (Lili):** This makes sense! But what about, um, price ceiling?

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** A price ceiling is a maximum price set by the government. It’s to prevent prices from going too high.

**Speaker B (Lili):** Ah, so if ceiling is low, it... can cause shortage?

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** Yes, that’s correct! Because more people want to buy at low prices, but suppliers may not want to sell that much.

**Speaker B (Lili):** Hmm, interesting. But, uh, what’s surplus then?

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** A surplus occurs when supply exceeds demand, often due to a high price floor set by the government.

**Speaker B (Lili):** Oh, I get it now! Supply and demand are, um, connected with prices.

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** Yes, you’ve got the main idea! Do you have any other questions on this topic?

**Speaker B (Lili):** Not now, thank you, Xiaoyu. You explain... very clear!

**Speaker A (Xiaoyu):** You're welcome, Lili! I'm glad I could help. Let’s keep practicing together.

**Speaker B (Lili):** Yes, we should. It’s more fun learning with frie
