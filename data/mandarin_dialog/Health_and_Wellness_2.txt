peaker A (Trainer):** Hi there! I'm glad you could make it today. Can you tell me a bit about your current exercise routine?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Uh, yes, thank you. I, um, like to do... uh, running. I run in park, maybe three times week.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a good start. How long do you usually run each time?

**Speaker B:** I run, um, maybe... thirty minutes? Sometimes more, if I have, uh... how to say... energy.

**Speaker A:** I understand. We'll look at some meal options that are both healthy and easy to prepare.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. I need, uh, easy things. Cooking is, um, not my strong... how to say... strong point?

**Speaker A:** No problem, we'll keep it simple. Do you have any questions about what we've discussed?

**Speaker B:** Um, no, I think I understand. Just need to do and practice more.
