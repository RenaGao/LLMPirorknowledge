peaker A (NS):** Hi! I'm really curious to learn about some traditions from your country. Can you tell me about one?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Oh, sure! Um, let me think... Oh! Chinese New Year is very famous. You know it?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I’ve heard of it, but I don’t know the details. What happens during Chinese New Year?

**Speaker B:** Ah, we, um, have big family dinner. Very important. We eat... uh, special food like dumpling and fish.

**Speaker A:** That sounds delicious! Is there any special meaning behind those foods?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. Dumpling, it look like... um... old money, so is for wealth. Fish mean, um, surplus, more than need?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I see! That’s interesting. Are there any particular traditions or activities?

**Speaker B:** Yes, many things. We do... um, how to say... lion dance in street? Very loud, with drum.

**Speaker A:** Lion dance sounds exciting! Is there a reason for it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is for... scare away bad spirit, and bring good luck for year.

**Speaker A:** That’s fascinating! Is there a specific color people wear during the celebration?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, red is important. It mean... um, good luck and happiness. People wear red clothes.

**Speaker A:** I’ve noticed red is a common theme. What about gifts? Do people exchange them?

**Speaker B:** Yes, we give... uh, red envelope with money inside. It is called hóngbāo, for children and young people.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I’ve heard of hóngbāo! Is there a specific amount that people usually give?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, it depend, but usually, um, even number is better. Odd number is not good luck.

**Speaker A:** That makes sense. Are there any other customs or taboos during this time?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. We... um, avoid cleaning on first day, because we don't want to... how to say... sweep away good luck.

**Speaker A:** That’s a unique tradition! How long do the celebrations usually last?

**Speaker B:** It is fifteen days long. Last day we have, um, Lantern Festival, with, uh, beautiful lanterns.

**Speaker B:** I like, um, family dinner most. Good food, and everyone together. Very happy time.

**Speaker A:** That sounds lovely. Thank you so much for sharing all of this with me!
