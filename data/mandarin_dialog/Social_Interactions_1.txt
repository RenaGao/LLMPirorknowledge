peaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hey, Xiao Ling! I heard you want to plan a birthday surprise for Xiaohua. How’s it going?

**Speaker B (Second-Language Speaker, Mandarin):** Oh, hi! Yes, um, I think... it's a little difficult. I not sure what Xiaohua like.

**Speaker A:** No worries! Let’s brainstorm together. What does Xiaohua enjoy doing?

**Speaker B:** Um, she... she like, uh, music and outdoor, you know, like park?

**Speaker A:** Great! Maybe we could organize a small picnic with music at the park?

**Speaker B:** Yes! That is good idea. But, um, how to say... should we also, um, invite others? Friends?

**Speaker A:** Definitely! The more, the merrier. We could make it a surprise gathering.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. I will, uh, talk to, um, Mei and Jun? They both close with Xiaohua.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. They can help with the planning too. What about food and drinks? Any thoughts?

**Speaker B:** Uh, maybe... we bring snacks? And drinks, like, um, soda or juice. Xiaohua like sweet, sweet things.

**Speaker A:** Sounds delicious! Do you think we should have a birthday cake as well?

**Speaker B:** Oh, yes! Cake is must. Um, maybe chocolate? Xiaohua favorite.

**Speaker A:** Chocolate cake it is. Do you want to order it, or should I?

**Speaker B:** Um, I can order. I know a good bakery. Very tasty.

**Speaker A:** Awesome! Should we have some games or activities planned too?

**Speaker B:** Mm, yes. But, um, I not sure what games. Maybe... music game? Dance?

**Speaker A:** A dance-off could be fun! We’ll just need some speakers for music.

**Speaker B:** I have speaker. It's small but loud. We can use it.

**Speaker A:** Perfect, that’ll work! What time should we tell everyone to meet?

**Speaker B:** How about... uh, 3 p.m.? So we have time to set up.

**Speaker A:** 3 p.m. sounds good. I’ll help with decorations. Maybe some balloons?

**Speaker B:** Yes, balloons! And maybe, um, banner? Say “Happy Birthday”?

**Speaker A:** Great idea! I’ll make a colorful banner. Anything else we should prepare?

**Speaker B:** Um, maybe... small gift. Everyone bring one? Like, uh, surprise gifts.

**Speaker A:** Yes, a little gift exchange could be fun. Let’s make sure everyone knows.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will send message to group chat. Thank you for help!

**Speaker A:** Anytime, Xiao Ling! It’s going to be a wonderful surprise for Xiaoh
