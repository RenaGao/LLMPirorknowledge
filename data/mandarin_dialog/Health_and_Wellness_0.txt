peaker A (Native Speaker, NS):** Hello! How can I help you today?

**Speaker B (Mandarin Speaker):** Um, hello. I feel not well. Headache, and my stomach... how to say... not good.

**Speaker A:** I see. You've been having headaches and stomach issues. How long has this been going on?

**Speaker B:** Uh, maybe three... three day? Yes, three days. It is very, um, uncomfortable.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any specific time when these symptoms get worse?

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. Night time more bad. Especially when I, um, lie down.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it worsens at night, especially when you lie down. Have you experienced any other symptoms? Like fever or nausea?

**Speaker B:** Fever, um, no. But nausea, yes, sometimes. And also, tired... very tired.

**Speaker A:** Got it. Do you have any allergies or are you taking any medications right now?

**Speaker B:** No allergies. I take, um, only the vitamin C.

**Speaker A:** Alright. Have you eaten anything unusual recently that might have upset your stomach?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, I eat spicy food, uh, hot pot, two days ago. Could be that?

**Speaker A:** It's possible. Spicy foods can sometimes cause stomach discomfort. Have you tried anything to relieve the symptoms?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I drink, um, ginger tea. Mother say it is good... um, for stomach.

**Speaker A:** Ginger tea is a good choice—it can help with nausea. Have you had plenty of water as well?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I drink much water. But still, um, feel weak.

**Speaker A:** It's important to stay hydrated. Since you're feeling weak and the symptoms persist, I suggest doing some tests to be safe.

**Speaker B:** Tests? Um, what kind of?

**Speaker A:** Blood test, maybe an ultrasound for your stomach. It will help us see what’s happening internally.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. That is good idea. I want to know what wrong.

**Speaker A:** Don’t worry, we’ll figure it out. For now, avoid spicy foods and get plenty of rest.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I will do that. Thank you for help.

**Speaker A:** You're welcome. Let's arrange those tests for you now. Take care!

**Speaker B:** Thank you. I feel better already, talking to y
