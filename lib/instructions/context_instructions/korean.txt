# Analysis of Grammatical Traits

	1.	Particles (조사):
	•	“에” (e): Indicates time or place in “이번 주말에” (ibeon jumal-e) (this weekend) and “한강에” (Hangang-e) (to the Han River).
	•	“에서” (eseo): Denotes the location of an action in “한강에서 뭐 할 거야?” (Hangang-eseo mwo hal geo-ya?) (What will we do at the Han River?).
	•	“는” (neun): Topic particle in “자전거는 어디에서” (jajeongeoneun eodieseo) (as for bikes, where?).
	2.	Politeness Levels (존댓말 vs. 반말):
	•	Casual speech (반말): Used between friends, e.g., “좋아!” (Joa!) (Good!) and “몇 시에 만날까?” (Myeot sie mannalkka?) (What time should we meet?).
	•	“알겠어” (Algesseo): Casual “Got it” contrasts with the polite form “알겠습니다” (Algesseumnida) used in formal situations.
	3.	Honorifics (높임말):
	•	Not explicitly used here because it’s a casual conversation. However, honorifics would replace casual speech for formal situations, e.g., “갈래요?” (Gallaeyo?) instead of “갈래?” (Gallae?).

	•	“한강에서” (Hangang-eseo): The topic of the activity is introduced.
	•	“자전거는” (Jajeongeoneun): Topic particle “는” (neun) emphasizes bikes.
	6.	Conditional Suggestions (제안):
	•	“탈까?” (talkka): Suggesting an action with the conditional suffix “까” (kka), “Shall we ride?”
	7.	Time Expressions (시간 표현):
	•	“오전 열한 시” (ojeon yeolhan si): Morning 11 o’clock.
	8.	Expressions of Agreement and Excitement:
	•	“완벽해!” (Wanbyeokhae!): “Perfect!” emphasizes excitement.
