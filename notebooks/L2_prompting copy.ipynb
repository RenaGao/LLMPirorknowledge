    "So, I want to speak English and I think speaking English will be always very good, you know--- \n",
    "Yeah, you know, I - since I - I went to Japan, I didn't have any much chance to speak English because the Japanese don't speak in English.\n",
    "They don't understand what I'm saying so - a little bit about last time, yeah last time a week.\n",

    "Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't - I don't remember much of the language so, you know, when - when I  trying to say something, I - I have to think for a moment.  You know, when I'm in China I don't have to hesitate.\n",

    "For example?\n",
    "For example what type?\n",
    "Yeah, I - yeah that matter I - there was any chance to speak.  You know, I was watching the tape, the DVD .\n",
    "XXX  very cool, there are the many lectures speaking here, and when I was here in, eh, college field, I - I want to say something about some - in college here, about lecture, about something like my - something about what I'm standing.\n",
    "Yeah, I - you know in China we have to do some test here and one, you know, I don't like some tests already - I don't like some tests, but I have to pass the test, so when you are ready for the test, you have to remember many of the XXX  verbs, grammar and listening and writing and frankly, to be honest, I hated this but - but when you ready for that, when you're practicing for that, you - you'll really get directly here, and I like watch - watch movie here - watch more in American and British, anyway.  I want - I want to speak like, talk like what is it there for.  Yeah.\n",
    "Yeah, it doesn't matter.\n",

    "Yeah, when, yeah, you can writing here, but if the people don't have chance to read it, what - what do you write, right?  Speaking with each other and the way is the first way to get your point.\n",

    "\n",
    "Terminology:\n",
    "In the philosophy of language and linguistics, a speech act is something expressed by an individual that not only presents information but performs an action as well.\n",
    "For example, the phrase \"I would like the mashed potatoes; could you please pass them to me?\" is considered a speech act as it expresses the speaker's desire to acquire the mashed potatoes, as well as presenting a request that someone pass the potatoes to them.\n",
    "According to Kent Bach, \"almost any speech act is really the performance of several acts at once, distinguished by different aspects of the speaker's intention: there is the act of saying something, what one does in saying it, such as requesting or promising, and how one is trying to affect one's audience\".\n",
    "The contemporary use of the term \"speech act\" goes back to J. L. Austin's development of performative utterances and his theory of locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts. Speech acts serve their function once they are said or communicated. \n",
    "These are commonly taken to include acts such as apologizing, promising, ordering, answering, requesting, complaining, warning, inviting, refusing, and congratulating.\n",

    "Passage: \n",
