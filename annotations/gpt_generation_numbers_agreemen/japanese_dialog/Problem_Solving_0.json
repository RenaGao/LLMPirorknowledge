        "rationale": "The sentence 'Yes, train is busy in evening. Sometimes delay... um, like late.' contains a numbers agreement error. The subject 'train' is singular, so the verb should be 'is'. However, 'Sometimes delay' suggests a plural subject, which is not consistent with 'train'. The correct form should be 'Sometimes it delays' or 'Trains sometimes delay'.",
